# Research Timeline Streamlit Application

Researchers often have to scour the scientific literature to understand complex topics. Tools like [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) help with this process by visualising parts of the citation network to higlight influential papers. However, network diagrams can become complex and easily misinterpreted. Therefore, this project aimed to produce a visualisation that was easily interpretable and fast to produce.
