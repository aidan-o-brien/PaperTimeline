Inappropriate activation of NLRP3 drives a chronic inflammatory response and is implicated in several non-communicable diseases, including gout, atherosclerosis, type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel boron compounds (NBCs) as NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors. Structure–activity relationships (SAR) show that 4-fluoro substituents on the phenyl rings retain NLRP3 inhibitory activity, whereas more steric and lipophilic substituents diminish activity. Loss of inhibitory activity is also observed if the CCl3 group on the oxazaborine ring is replaced by a CF3 group. These findings provide additional understanding of the NBC series and will aid in the development of these NLRP3 inhibitors as tool compounds or therapeutic candidates for sterile inflammatory diseases.",boron | inflammation | NLRP3 inflammasome | oxazaborines | structure–activity relationships,14,1,MRC,1916343,Medical Research Council,origin paper,0.0,2018-02-01

Here, we use 2APB as a chemical scaffold to build a series of inhibitors, the NBC series, which inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo without affecting Ca2+ homeostasis.

Inappropriate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the progression of many noncommunicable diseases such as gout, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Inhibiting the inflammasome may significantly reduce damaging inflammation and is therefore regarded as a therapeutic target.

Inflammatory lifestyle factors increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Zinc deficiency is the most prevalent malnutrition in the world and may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease potentially through enhanced inflammation, although evidence for this is limited. Here we provide epidemiological evidence suggesting that zinc supplementation was associated with reduced risk and slower cognitive decline, in people with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Using the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease fed a control (35mg/kg zinc) or diet deficient in zinc (3mg/kg zinc), we determined that zinc deficiency accelerated Alzheimer's-like memory deficits without modifying amyloid b plaque burden in the brains of male mice. The NLRP3-inflammasome complex is one of the most important regulators of inflammation, and we show here that zinc deficiency in immune cells, including microglia, potentiated NLRP3 responses to inflammatory stimuli in vitro, including amyloid oligomers, while zinc supplementation inhibited NLRP3 activation. APP/PS1 mice deficient in NLRP3 were protected against the accelerated cognitive decline with zinc deficiency.

In many cases, secretion of IL-1 cytokines appears to be closely coupled to cell death, yet the secretory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the secretion of the three best-characterized members of the IL-1 superfamily, IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-18, in a range of conditions and cell types, including murine bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages, HeLa cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We discovered that IL-1β and IL-18 share a common secretory pathway that depends upon membrane permeability and can operate in the absence of complete cell lysis and cell death. We also found that the pathway regulating the trafficking of IL-1α is distinct from the pathway regulating IL-1β and IL-18. Although the release of IL-1α could also be dissociated from cell death, it was independent of the effects of the membrane-stabilizing agent punicalagin, which inhibited both IL-1β and IL-18 release. These results reveal that in addition to their role as danger signals released from dead cells, IL-1 family cytokines can be secreted in the absence of cell death. We propose that models used in the study of IL-1 release should be considered context-dependently.",,21,1,WT,MR/K501311/1,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0.0,2019-05-01

Fenamate NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, limiting their potential as therapeutics for NLRP3-associated diseases due to established side effects. The aim here was to develop properties of the fenamates that inhibit NLRP3, and at the same time to reduce COX inhibition. We synthesised a library of analogues, with feedback from in silico COX docking potential, and IL-1β release inhibitory activity. Through iterative screening and rational chemical design, we established a collection of chloride channel inhibiting active lead molecules with potent activity at the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome and no activity at COX enzymes, but only in response to stimuli that activated NLRP3 by a K+ efflux-dependent mechanism.

Chloride efflux is suggested as an important step in NLRP3 activation, but which chloride channels are involved is still unknown. We used chemical, biochemical, and genetic approaches to establish the importance of chloride channels in the regulation of NLRP3 in murine macrophages. Specifically, we identify LRRC8A, an essential component of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC), as a vital regulator of hypotonicity-induced, but not DAMP-induced, NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Inflammasomes such as the one formed by NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains containing protein 3 (NLRP3) are key regulators of inflammation due to their ability to induce the processing and secretion of interleukin 1β (IL-1β). IL-1β has previously been identified as a potential therapeutic target in a variety of conditions due to its ability to promote neuronal damage under conditions of injury. Thus, inflammasome inhibition has the potential to curtail inflammatory signaling, which could prove beneficial in certain diseases. In this review, we discuss the evidence for inflammasome contributions to the pathology of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and acute degeneration following brain trauma or stroke.

Therefore, we assessed long-term changes in body composition, metabolic markers and behaviour after middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. These outcomes were also studied in the context of obesity, a common stroke co-morbidity proposed to protect against post-stroke weight loss in patients. We found that stroke induced long-term changes in body composition, characterised by a sustained loss of fat mass with a recovery of lean weight loss. These global changes in response to stroke were accompanied by an altered lipid profile (increased plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides) and increased adipokine release at 60 days. After stroke, the liver also showed histological changes indicative of liver damage and a decrease in plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was observed. Stroke induced depression and anxiety-like behaviours in mice, illustrated by deficits in exploration, nest building and burrowing behaviours. When initial infarct volumes were matched between mice with and without comorbid obesity, these outcomes were not drastically altered.

Twelve UK VCI research centres were identified and invited to complete a questionnaire and attend a one-day workshop. Questionnaire responses demonstrated agreement that outcome assessments in VCI preclinical research vary by group and even those common across groups, may be performed differently. From the workshop, six themes were discussed: issues with preclinical models, reasons for choosing functional assessments, issues in interpretation of functional assessments, describing and reporting functional outcome assessments, sharing resources and expertise, and standardization of outcomes. Eight consensus points emerged demonstrating broadly that the chosen assessment should reflect the deficit being measured, and therefore that one assessment does not suit all models; guidance/standardisation on recording VCI outcome reporting is needed and that uniformity would be aided by a platform to share expertise, material, protocols and procedures thus reducing heterogeneity and so increasing potential for collaboration, comparison and replication.

The classical hall marks of Alzheimer's disease include the accumulation of amyloid oligomers and fibrils, and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. It is now clear that inflammation also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease through a number of neurotoxic mechanisms. Microglia are the key immune regulators of the CNS which detect amyloidopathy through cell surface and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and respond by initiating inflammation through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Inflammasomes, which regulate IL-1β release, are formed following activation of cytosolic PRRs, and using genetic and pharmacological approaches, NLRP3 and NLRP1 inflammasomes have been found to be integral in pathogenic neuroinflammation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the inflammasomes are very promising novel pharmacological targets which merit further research in the continued endeavor for efficacious therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's disease | inflammasomes | inflammation,63,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1.0,2017-03-01

CD8+ cells specific for EBV late lytic cycle antigens show poor recognition of target cells compared to immediate early and early antigen-specific CD8+ cells. This phenomenon is due in part to the early EBV protein BILF1, whose immunosuppressive activity increases with lytic cycle progression. However, published data suggest the existence of a hitherto unidentified immune evasion protein further enhancing protection against late EBV antigen-specific CD8+ cells. We have now identified the late lytic BDLF3 gene as the missing link accounting for efficient evasion during the late lytic cycle. Interestingly, BDLF3 also contributes to evasion of CD4+ cell responses to EBV. We report that BDLF3 downregulates expression of surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules in the absence of any effect upon other surface molecules screened, including CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD71 (transferrin receptor). BDLF3 both enhanced internalization of surface MHC molecules and reduced the rate of their appearance at the cell surface. The reduced expression of surface MHC molecules correlated with functional protection against CD8+ and CD4+ T cell recognition. The molecular mechanism was identified as BDLF3-induced ubiquitination of MHC molecules and their subsequent downregulation in a proteasome-dependent manner.",,30,1,MRC,G0901755,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0.5,2016-01-01

After priming and activation by inflammation triggers, NLRP3 forms a complex with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD domain (ASC) followed by formation of the active inflammasome. Identification of inhibitors of NLRP3 activation requires a well-validated primary high-throughput assay followed by the deployment of a screening cascade of assays enabling studies of structure–activity relationship, compound selectivity and efficacy in disease models. We optimized a NLRP3-dependent fluorescent tagged ASC speck formation assay in murine immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages and utilized it to screen a compound library of 81,000 small molecules. Our high-content screening assay yielded robust assay metrics and identified a number of inhibitors of NLRP3-dependent ASC speck formation, including compounds targeting HSP90, JAK and IKK-β. Additional assays to investigate inflammasome priming or activation, NLRP3 downstream effectors such as caspase-1, IL-1β and pyroptosis form the basis of a screening cascade to identify NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors in drug discovery programs.",,0,1,ARUK,ARUK-2015DDI-OX,Alzheimer’s Research UK,papers by authors,0.0,2021-12-01

In primary monocytes, in response to LPS, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is characterized by an independence of K+ efflux and ASC speck formation and has been termed the ‘alternative’ pathway. Here, we report that pharmacological inhibition of V-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 exacerbated LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in primary human monocytes. Inhibition of V-ATPase in the presence of extracellular LPS led to NLRP3-dependent, K+ efflux-independent, ASC oligomerization and caspase-1 activation. Although V-ATPases are required for lysosomal acidification, we found that acidic lysosomal pH and protease activity were dispensable for this altered response, suggesting that V-ATPase inhibition triggered alternative signalling events.

Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is used to evaluate and recondition extended criteria donor lungs for transplantation. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been identified as a prognostic indicator of nonrecovery during EVLP. This may be an effect of inflammasome activation or cellular necrosis following donation and graft preservation. Delineating the mechanism of IL-1β release is required. Methods. The inactive intracellular precursor molecule, pro-IL-1β, was characterized along with the pro-IL-1β processing enzyme, caspase-1, in the perfusate of n = 20 human lungs that had undergone EVLP (n = 10 lungs that failed to recover and were discarded versus n = 10 lungs that reconditioned and were transplanted). In an experimental porcine model, n = 8 lungs underwent EVLP and were randomized to receive either a specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor or control. Results. Significant increases in pro-IL-1β and caspase-1 were observed in the perfusate from human lungs that did not recondition during EVLP compared with those that successfully reconditioned and were used for transplantation. Within the porcine EVLP, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition reduced IL-1β within the perfusate compared with controls, but this had no impact on lung function, hemodynamics, or inflammation. Conclusions. Our data suggest that pro-IL-1β is passively released following cellular necrosis of the donor lung.",,0,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2021-01-01

We report that the HSP90 inhibitor EC144 effectively inhibited inflammatory processes including priming and activation of NLRP3 in vitro and in vivo. A specific inhibitor of the β HSP90 isoform was ineffective suggesting the importance of the α isoform in inflammatory signalling.

How the effects of diverse stimuli are integrated by the cell to regulate NLRP3 has been the subject of intense research, and yet an accepted unifying hypothesis for the control of NLRP3 remains elusive. Here, we review the literature on the effects of NLRP3-activating stimuli on subcellular organelles and conclude that a shared feature of NLRP3-activating stresses is an organelle dysfunction. In particular, we propose that the endosome may be more important than previously recognized as a signal-integrating hub for NLRP3 activation in response to many stimuli and may also link to the dysfunction of other organelles. In addition, NLRP3-inflammasome-activating stimuli trigger diverse posttranslational modifications of NLRP3 that are important in controlling its activation. Future research should focus on how organelles respond to specific NLRP3-activating stimuli, and how this relates to posttranslational modifications, to delineate the organellar control of NLRP3.",,4,1,MRC,MR/T016515/1,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1.5,2020-12-01

Inflammasomes form part of the innate immune system that triggers the activation of inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. The inflammasome most studied in sterile inflammation and non-communicable disease is the NLRP3 inflammasome. Upon activation by diverse pathogen or disease associated signals, NLRP3 nucleates the oligomerization of an adaptor protein ASC forming a platform (the inflammasome) for the recruitment and activation of the protease caspase-1.

This capability is substantially reduced upon chronic damage, but it is not clear if this is a cause or consequence of liver disease. Here, we investigate whether blocking hepatocyte division using two different mouse models affects physiology as well as clinical liver manifestations like fibrosis and inflammation. We find that in P14 Cdk1Liv-/- mice, where the division of hepatocytes is abolished, polyploidy, DNA damage, and increased p53 signaling are prevalent. Cdk1Liv-/- mice display classical markers of liver damage two weeks after birth, including elevated ALT, ALP, and bilirubin levels, despite the lack of exogenous liver injury. Inflammation was further studied using cytokine arrays, unveiling elevated levels of CCL2, TIMP1, CXCL10, and IL1-Rn in Cdk1Liv-/- liver, which resulted in increased numbers of monocytes. Ablation of CDK2-dependent DNA re-replication and polyploidy in Cdk1Liv-/- mice reversed most of these phenotypes. Overall, our data indicate that blocking hepatocyte division induces biological processes driving the onset of the disease phenotype. It suggests that the decrease in hepatocyte division observed in liver disease may not only be a consequence of fibrosis and inflammation, but also a pathological cue.",,5,1,A*STAR,1231AFG031,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research",papers by authors,0.5,2020-11-01

Thus, NLRP3 inflammasome assembly must be tightly controlled at several checkpoints. The priming step of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is associated with increased NLRP3 gene expression, as well as post-translational modifications that control NLRP3 levels and licence the NLRP3 protein for inflammasome assembly. Increasing life expectancy in modern society is accompanied by a growing percentage of elderly individuals. The process of aging is associated with chronic inflammation that drives and/or worsens a range of age related non-communicable conditions. The NLRP3 inflammasome is known to contribute to pathological inflammation in many settings, but the mechanisms that prime NLRP3 for activation throughout aging and related co-morbidities have not been extensively reviewed.

They are produced as inactive precursors that are activated by large macromolecular complexes called inflammasomes upon sensing damage or pathogenic signals. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is regarded to require a priming step that causes NLRP3 and IL-1β gene upregulation, and also NLRP3 post-translational licencing. A subsequent activation step leads to the assembly of the complex and the cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1β by caspase-1 into their mature forms, allowing their release. Here we show that human monocytes, but not monocyte derived macrophages, are able to form canonical NLRP3 inflammasomes in the absence of priming. NLRP3 activator nigericin caused the processing and release of constitutively expressed IL-18 in an unprimed setting. This was mediated by the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome that was dependent on K+ and Cl− efflux and led to ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 and Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) cleavage. IL-18 release was impaired by the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and by the absence of NLRP3, but also by deficiency of GSDMD, suggesting that pyroptosis is the mechanism of release. This work highlights the readiness of the NLRP3 inflammasome to assemble in the absence of priming in human monocytes and hence contribute to the very early stages of the inflammatory response when IL-1β has not yet been produced. It is important to consider the unprimed setting when researching the mechanisms of NLRP3 activation, as to not overshadow the pathways that occur in the absence of priming stimuli, which might only enhance this response.",GSDMD | IL-18 | inflammasome | macrophage | monocytes | NLRP3 | priming,10,1,WT,110091,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0.0,2020-09-01

Clinical prediction models play a critical role in this process, but current models are of limited value because they are typically restricted to baseline predictors and do not always use contemporary statistical methods. We sought to explore the benefits of incorporating dynamic changes in routinely measured biomarkers, non-linear effects and applying 'state-of-the-art' statistical methods in the development of a prognostic model to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: The data were analysed from admissions with COVID-19 to three hospital sites. Exploratory data analysis included a graphical approach to partial correlations. Dynamic biomarkers were considered up to 5 days following admission rather than depending solely on baseline or single time-point data. Marked departures from linear effects of covariates were identified by employing smoothing splines within a generalised additive modelling framework. SETTING: 3 secondary and tertiary level centres in Greater Manchester, the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 392 hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: 392 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.73 using admission data alone to 0.75 when also considering results of baseline blood samples and to 0.83 when considering dynamic values of routinely collected markers. There was clear non-linearity in the association of age with patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that clinical prediction models to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can be improved by taking into account both non-linear effects in covariates such as age and dynamic changes in values of biomarkers.",intensive &amp; critical care | respiratory infections | statistics &amp; research methods,2,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1.0,2020-09-01

Far from a homogenous proliferation of Schwann cells, mounting evidence has highlighted the complex nature of the inflammatory microenvironment in these tumors. Methods A review of the literature pertaining to inflammation, inflammatory molecular pathways, and immune-related therapeutic targets in VS was performed. Relevant studies published up to June 2020 were identified based on a literature search in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases and the findings were synthesized into a concise narrative review of the topic. Results The VS microenvironment is characterized by a dense infiltrate of inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages. Significantly higher levels of immune cell infiltration are observed in growing versus static tumors, and there is a demonstrable interplay between inflammation and angiogenesis in growing VS. While further mechanistic studies are required to ascertain the exact role of inflammation in angiogenesis, tumor growth, and Schwann cell control, we are beginning to understand the key molecular pathways driving this inflammatory microenvironment, and how these processes can be monitored and targeted in vivo. Conclusion Observational research has revealed a complex and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment in VS. The functional landscape and roles of macrophages and other immune cells in the VS inflammatory infiltrate are, however, yet to be established. The antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab has shown the efficacy of targeted molecular therapies in VS and there is hope that agents targeting another major component of the VS microenvironment, inflammation, will also find a place in their future management.",angiogenesis | antiangiogenic | bevacizumab | biomarkers | immunomodulation | immunotherapy | inflammation | tumor immunology | tumor-associated macrophages | vestibular schwannoma,1,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2020-01-01

Objective: We aim to demonstrate the applicability of GO for interpretation of AD datasets to improve the understanding of the underlying molecular disease mechanisms, including the involvement of inflammatory pathways and dysregulated microRNAs (miRs). Methods: We have undertaken a systematic full article GO annotation approach focused on microglial proteins implicated in AD and the miRs regulating their expression. PANTHER was used for enrichment analysis of previously published AD data. Cytoscape was used for visualizing and analyzing miR-target interactions captured from published experimental evidence. Results: We contributed 3,084 new annotations for 494 entities, i.e., on average six new annotations per entity. This included a total of 1,352 annotations for 40 prioritized microglial proteins implicated in AD and 66 miRs regulating their expression, yielding an average of twelve annotations per prioritized entity. The updated GO resource was then used to re-analyze previously published data. The re-analysis showed novel processes associated with AD-related genes, not identified in the original study, such as 'gliogenesis', 'regulation of neuron projection development', or 'response to cytokine', demonstrating enhanced applicability of GO for neuroscience research.

We previously showed that Ym1, an alternative activation marker, can drive innate IL-1R-dependent neutrophil recruitment during infection with the lung-migrating nematode, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, suggesting a potential role for the inflammasome in the IL-1-mediated innate response to infection. Although inflammasome proteins such as NLRP3 have important proinflammatory functions in macrophages, their role during type 2 responses and repair are less defined. We therefore infected Nlrp3-/- mice with N. brasiliensis. Unexpectedly, compared with wild-type (WT) mice, infected Nlrp3-/- mice had increased neutrophilia and eosinophilia, correlating with enhanced worm killing but at the expense of increased tissue damage and delayed lung repair. Transcriptional profiling showed that infected Nlrp3-/- mice exhibited elevated type 2 gene expression compared with WT mice. Notably, inflammasome activation was not evident early postinfection with N. brasiliensis, and in contrast to Nlrp3-/- mice, antihelminth responses were unaffected in caspase-1/11-deficient or WT mice treated with the NLRP3-specific inhibitor MCC950. Together these data suggest that NLRP3 has a role in constraining lung neutrophilia, helminth killing, and type 2 immune responses in an inflammasome-independent manner.",,7,1,WT,106898/A/15/Z,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,1.0,2019-11-01

cumbersome and time-consuming traditional embryonic stem cell-based methods. An earlier study reported up to 16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout (cKO or floxed) alleles by microinjection of 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded oligonucleotides as donors (referred herein as ""two-donor floxing"" method). Results: We re-evaluate the two-donor method from a consortium of 20 laboratories across the world. The dataset constitutes 56 genetic loci, 17,887 zygotes, and 1718 live-born mice, of which only 15 (0.87%) mice contain cKO alleles. We subject the dataset to statistical analyses and a machine learning algorithm, which reveals that none of the factors analyzed was predictive for the success of this method. We test some of the newer methods that use one-donor DNA on 18 loci for which the two-donor approach failed to produce cKO alleles. We find that the one-donor methods are 10- to 20-fold more efficient than the two-donor approach. Conclusion: We propose that the two-donor method lacks efficiency because it relies on two simultaneous recombination events in cis, an outcome that is dwarfed by pervasive accompanying undesired editing events. The methods that use one-donor DNA are fairly efficient as they rely on only one recombination event, and the probability of correct insertion of the donor cassette without unanticipated mutational events is much higher. Therefore, one-donor methods offer higher efficiencies for the routine generation of cKO animal models.",Conditional knockout mouse | CRISPR-Cas9 | Floxed allele | Homology-directed repair | Long single-stranded DNA | Machine learning | Mouse | Oligonucleotide | Reproducibility | Transgenesis,19,1,NIH,CZ.1.05/2.1.00/19.0395,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1.5,2019-08-01

The lack of relevant non-transgenic preclinical models reflective of disease progression is one of the main factors hindering the discovery of effective drug treatments. To this end, we have developed a protocol for the fabrication of alginate microbeads containing amyloid-secreting cells useful for the study of the effects of chronic Aβ production. Chinese hamster ovary cells previously transfected with a human APP gene, secreting Aβ (i.e., 7PA2 cells), were used in this study. A three-dimensional (3D) in vitro model for the sustained release of Aβ was fabricated by encapsulation of 7PA2 cells in alginate. The process was optimized to target a bead diameter of 500-600 μm for further in vivo studies. Optimization of 7PA2 cell encapsulation in alginate was performed altering fabrication parameters, e.g., alginate concentration, gel flow rate, electrostatic potential, head vibration frequency, gelling solution. Levels of secreted Aβ were analyzed over time and compared between alginate beads and standard cell culture methods (up to 96 h). A concentration of 1.5 x 106 7PA2 cells/mL and an alginate concentration of 2% (w/v) buffered with HEPES and subsequent gelation in 0.5 M calcium chloride for 5 min were found to fabricate the most stable microbeads. Fabricated microbeads were 1) of uniform size, 2) with an average diameter of 550 μm, 3) containing about 100-150 cells per microbead and 4) able to secrete Aβ. In conclusion, our optimized method for the production of stable alginate microbeads containing amyloid-producing 7PA2 cells might enable the modeling of important aspects of AD both in vitro and in vivo.",3D in vitro models | Alginate | Alzheimer's disease | Amyloid | Aβ | Biology | Controlled release | Encapsulation | Hydrogels | Issue 149,1,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2.0,2019-07-01

Inflammasomes are multimolecular protein complexes that drive inflammation through activation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL (interleukin)-1β. Preclinical evidence suggests that IL-1β contributes to a worsening of ischemic brain injury. Methods - Using a mouse middle cerebral artery thrombosis model, we examined the inflammatory response after stroke and the contribution of the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome to ischemic injury. Results - There was a marked inflammatory response after stroke characterized by increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and NLRP3 and by recruitment of leukocytes to the injured tissue. Targeting NLRP3 with the inhibitor MCC950, or using mice in which NLRP3 was knocked out, had no effect on the extent of injury caused by stroke. Conclusions - These data suggest that the NLRP3 pathway does not contribute to the inflammation exacerbating ischemic brain damage, contradicting several recent reports to the contrary.",brain | cytokine | inflammasome | inflammation | interleukin,18,1,WT,106898/A/15/Z,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0.0,2019-05-01

In this context, therapeutic interventions aimed at protectively modulating host responses, to enhance defence against infection, take on ever greater significance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important multidrug-resistant, opportunistic respiratory pathogen, the clearance of which can be enhanced in vivo by the innate immune modulatory properties of antimicrobial host defence peptides from the cathelicidin family, including human LL-37. Initially described primarily as bactericidal agents, cathelicidins are now recognised as multifunctional antimicrobial immunomodulators, modifying host responses to pathogens, but the key mechanisms involved in these protective functions are not yet defined. We demonstrate that P. aeruginosa infection of airway epithelial cells promotes extensive infected cell internalisation of LL-37, in a manner that is dependent upon epithelial cell interaction with live bacteria, but does not require bacterial Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS). Internalised LL-37 acts as a second signal to induce inflammasome activation in airway epithelial cells, which, in contrast to myeloid cells, are relatively unresponsive to P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that this is mechanistically dependent upon cathepsin B release, and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase 1. These result in LL-37-mediated release of IL-1â and IL-18 in a manner that is synergistic with P. aeruginosa infection, and can induce caspase 1-dependent death of infected epithelial cells, and promote neutrophil chemotaxis. We propose that cathelicidin can therefore act as a second signal, required by P. aeruginosa infected epithelial cells to promote an inflammasome-mediated altruistic cell death of infection-compromised epithelial cells and act as a ""fire alarm"" to enhance rapid escalation of protective inflammatory responses to an uncontrolled infection. Understanding this novel modulatory role for cathelicidins, has the potential to inform development of novel therapeutic strategies to antibiotic-resistant pathogens, harnessing innate immunity as a complementation or alternative to current interventions.",,17,1,MRC,G1002046,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0.0,2019-01-01

Small, thin (s)-GO dose-dependently inhibited release of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 but not tumor necrosis factor α. NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activation was not affected. The effect of s-GO was pretranslational, as s-GO blocked Toll-like receptor 4-dependent expression of Il1b and Il6 but not Nlrp3 or Tnf mRNA transcripts. s-GO was internalized by immortalized bone-marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting a potential intracellular action. Uptake of polystyrene beads with similar lateral dimensions and surface charge did not phenocopy the effects of s-GO, suggesting that s-GO-mediated inhibition of interleukin expression was not simply due to particle phagocytosis. RNA-Seq analysis established that s-GO had profound effects on the immunometabolism of the cells, leading to activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, which inhibited expression of cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6. Thus, we have identified immunometabolic effects of GO that reveal another dimension to its effects on cells.

Specifically, proteins and protein complexes relevant to processes involving amyloid-beta and tau have been annotated and the resulting annotations are denoted in GO databases as ‘ARUK-UCL’. Biological knowledge presented in the scientific literature was captured through the association of GO terms with dementia-relevant protein records; GO itself was revised, and new GO terms were added. This literature biocuration increased the number of Alzheimer’s-relevant gene products that were being associated with neurological GO terms, such as ‘amyloid-beta clearance’ or ‘learning or memory’, as well as neuronal structures and their compartments. Of the total 2055 annotations that we contributed for the prioritised gene products, 526 have associated proteins and complexes with neurological GO terms. To ensure that these descriptive annotations could be provided for Alzheimer’s-relevant gene products, over 70 new GO terms were created.

Deubiquitinases (DUBs) counteract the addition of ubiquitin and are essential regulators of immune signalling pathways, including those acting on the inflammasome. How DUBs control the assembly and activation of inflammasomes is unclear. Here, we show that the DUBs USP7 and USP47 regulate inflammasome activation in macrophages. Chemical inhibition of USP7 and USP47 blocks inflammasome formation, independently of transcription, by preventing ASC oligomerisation and speck formation. We also provide evidence that the ubiquitination status of NLRP3 itself is altered by inhibition of USP7 and USP47. Interestingly, we found that the activity of USP7 and USP47 increased in response to inflammasome activators. Using CRISPR/Cas9 in the macrophage cell line THP-1, we show that inflammasome activation is reduced when both USP7 and USP47 are knocked down. Altogether, these data reveal a new post-transcriptional role for USP47 and USP7 in inflammation by regulating inflammasome activation and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and implicate dual USP7 and USP47 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory disease.",deubiquitination | inflammasome | macrophages | USP47 | USP7,55,1,GSK,MR/N029992/1,AstraZeneca,papers by authors,0.0,2018-10-01

Bioinformatics analyses revealed IL33 as a critical regulator of neuroinflammation and cerebral pathology that is down-regulated in the brain during fatal ECM and in the acute period following treatment of ECM. Consistent with this, administration of IL33 alongside antimalarial drugs significantly improved the treatment success of established ECM. Mechanistically, IL33 treatment reduced inflammasome activation and IL1β production in microglia and intracerebral monocytes in the acute recovery period following treatment of ECM. Moreover, treatment with the NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 alongside antimalarial drugs phenocopied the protective effect of IL33 therapy in improving the recovery from established ECM. We further showed that IL1β release from macrophages was stimulated by hemozoin and antimalarial drugs and that this was inhibited by MCC950.

Direct, noninvasive monitoring of inflammation in the human brain after ICH will facilitate early-phase development of anti-inflammatory treatments. We sought to investigate the feasibility of multimodality brain imaging in subacute ICH. METHODS: Acute ICH patients were recruited to undergo multiparametric MRI (including dynamic contrast-enhanced measurement of blood-brain barrier transfer constant (Ktrans) and PET with [11C]-(R)-PK11195). [11C]-(R)-PK11195 binds to the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), which is rapidly upregulated in activated microglia. Circulating inflammatory markers were measured at the time of PET. RESULTS: Five patients were recruited to this feasibility study with imaging between 5 and 16 days after onset. Etiologies included hypertension-related small vessel disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), cavernoma, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM). [11C]-(R)-PK11195 binding was low in all hematomas and 2 (patient 2 [probable CAA] and 4 [AVM]) cases showed widespread increase in binding in the perihematomal region versus contralateral. All had increased Ktrans in the perihematomal region (mean difference = 2.2 × 10−3 minute−1; SD = 1.6 × 10−3 minute−1) versus contralateral. Two cases (patients 1 [cavernoma] and 4 [AVM]) had delayed surgery (3 and 12 months post-onset, respectively) with biopsies showing intense microglial activation in perilesional tissue.

Inflammatory mediators include cytokines of the interleukin-1 family, such as IL-1α and IL-1β. Unlike IL-1β, IL-1α carries an N-terminal nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and is trafficked to the nucleus. The importance of IL-1α nuclear localisation is poorly understood. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to make inactivating mutations to the NLS on the Il1a gene. A colony of NLS mutant mice was successfully generated with precise knock-in mutations to incapacitate NLS function. NLS mutant mice had no gross changes in immunophenotype or inflammatory response but, surprisingly, failed to express IL-1α. We deduced that, in making specific mutations in the Il1a gene, we also mutated a long-noncoding (lnc)RNA in the complementary strand which has cis-regulatory transcriptional control of the Il1a gene itself. The mutations generated in the Il1a gene also result in mutation of the lncRNA sequence and a predicted alteration of its secondary structure, potentially explaining a subsequent failure to function as a transcriptional activator of Il1a expression. Thus, lncRNA secondary structure may regulate IL-1α expression. Our results serve as a cautionary note that CRISPR -mediated genome editing without full knowledge of genomic context can result in unexpected, yet potentially informative observations.",,0,1,WT,097820/Z/11/B,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0.0,2017-12-01

Salmonella typhimurium infection is reported to activate NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes which are subsequently involved in pyroptosis of the cell and pathogen clearance. However, the response to S. typhimurium in primary human monocytes has not been studied in detail. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of S. typhimurium on inflammasomes in primary human monocytes. Much of the previous research in the field has been conducted in murine models and human THP-1 cells, which may not reflect the responses of primary human monocytes. Here, we report that inhibiting NLRP3 with the selective inhibitor MCC950, blocked release of IL-1β and the related cytokine IL-1α from primary human monocytes in response to S. typhimurium. Additionally, under these conditions S. typhimurium-induced IL-1 release occurred independently of pyroptosis. We propose that IL-1β release without pyroptosis may occur in early-recruited monocytes to regulate a maximal innate immune response to Salmonella infection, allowing a sustained inflammatory signal.

P2X7R is widely expressed in the gut by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and epithelial cells, but the role of the P2X7R on epithelial cells is poorly understood. We investigated P2X7R in intestinal epithelium in vitro and in vivo using two model infections, Toxoplasma gondii and Trichinella spiralis. Lipopolysaccharide and ATP treatment of intestinal epithelial cells and infection with T. gondii in vitro did not promote inflammasome-associated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or IL-18 secretion, but promoted C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), tumour necrosis factor-α and IL-6 production that were significantly reduced when the P2X7R was blocked. Similarly, in vivo, infection with either T. spiralis or T. gondii induced rapid upregulation of epithelial CCL5 in wild-type (wild-type (WT)) mice that was significantly reduced in P2X7R-/- littermate controls. The effects of reduced epithelial CCL5 were assayed by investigating recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) to the epithelium. Infection induced a rapid recruitment of CD11c+ CD10+ DC subsets into the epithelial layer of WT mice but not P2X7R-/- mice.

Although mechanisms of unconventional protein secretion are beginning to emerge, the precise molecular details have remained elusive for the majority of cargo proteins secreted by unconventional means. Recent findings suggest that for two examples of unconventionally secreted proteins, interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), the common molecular principle of pore formation may be shared. Under specific experimental conditions, secretion of IL-1β and FGF2 is triggered by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]- dependent formation of pores across the plasma membrane. However, the underlying mechanisms are different, with FGF2 known to directly interact with PI(4,5)P2, whereas in the case of IL- 1β secretion, it is proposed that the N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D interacts with PI(4,5)P2 to form the pore. Thus, although implemented in different ways, these findings suggest that pore formation may be shared by the unconventional secretion mechanisms for FGF2 and IL-1β in at least some cases.

Inflammatory processes are associated with the aetiology and clinical progression of migraine, psychiatric conditions, epilepsy, cerebrovascular diseases, dementia and neurodegeneration, such as seen in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. Both central and systemic inflammatory actions have been linked with the development of brain diseases, suggesting that complex neuro-immune interactions could contribute to pathological changes in the brain across multiple temporal and spatial scales. However, the mechanisms through which inflammation impacts on neurological disease are improperly defined. To develop effective therapeutic approaches, it is imperative to understand how detrimental inflammatory processes could be blocked selectively, or controlled for prolonged periods, without compromising essential immune defence mechanisms. Increasing evidence indicates that common risk factors for brain disorders, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, obesity or infection involve the activation of NLRP3, NLRP1, NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasomes, which are also associated with various neurological diseases.

IL-1β is not secreted through the conventional ER-Golgi route of protein secretion, and to date its mechanism of release has been unknown. Crucially, its secretion depends upon the processing of a precursor form following the activation of the multimolecular inflammasome complex. Using a novel and reversible pharmacological inhibitor of the IL-1β release process, in combination with biochemical, biophysical, and real-time single-cell confocal microscopy with macrophage cells expressing Venus-labelled IL-1β, we have discovered that the secretion of IL-1β after inflammasome activation requires membrane permeabilisation, and occurs in parallel with the death of the secreting cell. Thus, in macrophages the release of IL-1β in response to inflammasome activation appears to be a secretory process independent of nonspecific leakage of proteins during cell death. The mechanism of membrane permeabilisation leading to IL-1β release is distinct from the unconventional secretory mechanism employed by its structural homologues fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) or IL-1α, a process that involves the formation of membrane pores but does not result in cell death.

The main focus of this investigation was to compare P2X7R-driven IL-1 production by primary murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and macrophages (BMM). P2X7R expression in murine BMDC and BMM at both transcriptional (P2X7A variant) and protein levels was demonstrated. Priming with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and receptor activation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) resulted in markedly enhanced IL-1 (α and β) secretion in BMDC compared with BMM. In both cell types IL-1 production was profoundly inhibited with a P2X7R-specific inhibitor (A-740003) demonstrating that this release is predominantly a P2X7R-dependent process. These data also suggest that P2X7R and caspase-1 activation drive IL-1α release from BMDC. Both cell types expressed constitutively the gain-of-function P2X7K as well as the full P2X7A variant at equivalent levels. LPS priming reduced significantly levels of P2X7A but not P2X7K transcripts in both BMDC and BMM. P2X7R-induced pore formation, assessed by YO-PRO-1 dye uptake, was greater in BMDC, and these cells were protected from cell death. These data demonstrate that DC and macrophages display distinct patterns of cytokine regulation, particularly with respect to IL-1, as a consequence of cell-type specific differences in the physicochemical properties of the P2X7R. Understanding the cell-specific regulation of these cytokines is essential for manipulating such responses in health and disease.",A-740003 | Dendritic cells | Interleukin-1 | Macrophages | P2X R 7,25,1,MRC,undefined,BASF,papers by authors,0.0,2015-12-01

Acute brain injury is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide. Despite this, treatments for acute brain injuries are limited, and there remains a massive unmet clinical need. Inflammation has emerged as a major contributor to non-communicable diseases, and there is now substantial and growing evidence that inflammation, driven by the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), worsens acute brain injury. Interleukin-1 is regulated by large, multimolecular complexes called inflammasomes. Here, we discuss the latest research on the regulation of inflammasomes and IL-1 in the brain, preclinical efforts to establish the IL-1 system as a therapeutic target, and the promise of recent and future clinical studies on blocking the action of IL-1 for the treatment of brain injury.",,16,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2015-12-01

A HEK-IL-1 reporter assay and brain endothelial cell line were used to explore activity of mature IL-1α and IL-1β at pH 7.4 and pH 6.2, an acidic pH that can be reached under inflammatory or ischemic conditions, alongside cathepsin D-cleaved 20-kDa IL-1β produced under acidic conditions. We report that mature IL-1 signaling at IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) is maintained at pH 6.2, but the activity of the decoy receptor, IL-1R2, is reduced. Additionally, cathepsin D-cleaved 20-kDa IL-1β was minimally active at IL-1R1 and was not further cleaved to highly active 17-kDa IL-1β.

By utilizing the new gene editing technique, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), as well as sensitive cell imaging techniques, these papers establish that cytoplasmic LPS-dependent IL-1β production requires the NLRP3 inflammasome and that its activation is dependent on K+ efflux, whereas IL-1α release and pyroptotic cell death pathways are NLRP3-independent.

ASC acts by bridging NLRP proteins, such as NLRP3, with procaspase-1 within the inflammasome complex, which subsequently results in the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. In response to bacterial infection, ASC also forms specks by self-oligomerization to activate caspase-1 and induce pyroptosis. Hitherto, the role of these specks in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to danger signals, such as a hypotonic environment, largely has been unexplored. In this article, we report that, under hypotonic conditions and independently of NLRP3, ASC was able to form specks that did not activate caspase-1. These specks were not associated with pyroptosis and were controlled by transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 channel-mediated signaling. However, interaction with NLRP3 enhanced ASC speck formation, leading to fully functional inflammasomes and caspase-1 activation. This study reveals that the ASC speck can present different oligomerization assemblies and represents an essential step in the activation of functional NLRP3 inflammasomes.",,46,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2015-02-01

Thus, besides developing direct immunostimulatory regimens, including dendritic cell-based vaccines, checkpoint-blocking therapies, and adoptive T-cell transfer, researchers have started to focus on the overall immunobiology of neoplastic cells. It is now clear that cancer cells can succumb to some anticancer therapies by undergoing a peculiar form of cell death that is characterized by an increased immunogenic potential, owing to the emission of the so-called ""damage-associated molecular patterns"" (DAMPs). The emission of DAMPs and other immunostimulatory factors by cells succumbing to immunogenic cell death (ICD) favors the establishment of a productive interface with the immune system. This results in the elicitation of tumor-targeting immune responses associated with the elimination of residual, treatment-resistant cancer cells, as well as with the establishment of immunological memory. Although ICD has been characterized with increased precision since its discovery, several questions remain to be addressed. Here, we summarize and tabulate the main molecular, immunological, preclinical, and clinical aspects of ICD, in an attempt to capture the essence of this phenomenon, and identify future challenges for this rapidly expanding field of investigation.",Anti-tumor immunity | Immunogenicity | Immunotherapy | Molecular medicine | Oncoimmunology | Patient prognosis | Translational medicine,210,1,H2020,G.0584.12N,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,papers by authors,0.0,2015-01-01

The secretion of these cytokines by dendritic cells (DC) is integral to the development of proinflammatory responses. These cytokines are not secreted via the classical secretory pathway. Instead, 2 independent processes are required; an initial signal to induce up-regulation of the precursor pro-IL-1α and -β, and a second signal to drive cleavage and consequent secretion. Pro- IL-1α and -β are both cytosolic and thus, are potentially subject to post-translational modifications. These modifications may, in turn, have a functional outcome in the context of IL-1α and -β secretion and hence inflammation. We report here that IL-1α and -β were degraded intracellularly in murine bone marrowderived DC and that this degradation was dependent on active cellular processes. In addition, we demonstrate that degradation was ablated when the proteasome was inhibited, whereas autophagy did not appear to play a major role. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasome led to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated IL-1α and -β, indicating that IL-1α and -β were polyubiquitinated prior to proteasomal degradation. Finally, our investigations suggest that polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are not continuous processes but instead are up-regulated following DC activation.

dead cell-associated antigens. However, multiple stimuli can trigger a functionally peculiar type of apoptotic demise that does not go unnoticed by the adaptive arm of the immune system, which we named “immunogenic cell death” (ICD). ICD is preceded or accompanied by the emission of a series of immunostimulatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in a precise spatiotemporal configuration. Several anticancer agents that have been successfully employed in the clinic for decades, including various chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy, can elicit ICD. Moreover, defects in the components that underlie the capacity of the immune system to perceive cell death as immunogenic negatively influence disease outcome among cancer patients treated with ICD inducers. Thus, ICD has profound clinical and therapeutic implications. Unfortunately, the gold-standard approach to detect ICD relies on vaccination experiments involving immunocompetent murine models and syngeneic cancer cells, an approach that is incompatible with large screening campaigns. Here, we outline strategies conceived to detect surrogate markers of ICD in vitro and to screen large chemical libraries for putative ICD inducers, based on a high-content, high-throughput platform that we recently developed. Such a platform allows for the detection of multiple DAMPs, like cell surface-exposed calreticulin, extracellular ATP and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and/or the processes that underlie their emission, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy and necrotic plasma membrane permeabilization. We surmise that this technology will facilitate the development of next-generation anticancer regimens, which kill malignant cells and simultaneously convert them into a cancer-specific therapeutic vaccine.",ATP release | Autophagy | Calreticulin | Endoplasmic reticulum stress | HMGB1 | Immunotherapy,455,1,ARC,undefined,Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer,papers by authors,0.5,2014-10-01

Processing of IL-1 precursor proteins to active cytokines commonly occurs through activation of proteases, notably caspases and calpains. These proteases are instrumental in cell death, and inflammation and cell death are closely associated, hence we sought to determine the impact of cell death pathways on IL-1 processing and release. We discovered that apoptotic regulation of caspase-8 specifically induced the processing and release of IL-1β. Conversely, necroptosis caused the processing and release of IL-1α, and this was independent of IL-1β processing and release. These data suggest that the mechanism through which an IL-1-expressing cell dies dictates the nature of the inflammatory mechanism that follows. These insights may allow modification of inflammation through the selective targeting of cell death mechanisms during disease. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) drives sterile inflammatory responses and is thus a very attractive therapeutic target. Activation of IL-1β in sterile diseases commonly requires an intracellular multi-protein complex called the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome. A number of disease-Associated danger molecules are known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. We show here that depletion of zinc from macrophages, a paradigm for zinc deficiency, also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces IL-1β secretion. Our data suggest that zinc depletion damages the integrity of lysosomes and that this event is important for NLRP3 activation.

Recombinant oligomeric protein particles composed of the adaptor ASC or the p.D303N mutant form of NLRP3 associated with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) stimulated further activation of caspase-1 extracellularly, as well as intracellularly after phagocytosis by surrounding macrophages. We found oligomeric ASC particles in the serum of patients with active CAPS but not in that of patients with other inherited autoinflammatory diseases.

The aim of this review is to discuss the recent literature describing the role of IL-1 in acute cerebrovascular disease and to provide an update on our current understanding of the mechanisms of IL-1 production. We also discuss the recent literature where the effects of IL-1 have been targeted in animal models, thus reviewing potential future strategies that may limit the devastating effects of acute cerebrovascular disease. © 2013 Galea and Brough.",Caspase-1 | Cerebral ischemia | Inflammation | Interleukin-1 | Microglia | Stroke,49,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.5,2013-08-01

It is not known if microglia, a resident brain macrophage population, polarizes in a similar way, and whether specific microglial phenotypes modulate cell death in response to brain injury. In this study, we show that both BV2-microglia and mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were able to adopt different phenotypes after LPS (M1) or IL-4 (M2) treatment in vitro, but regulated cell death differently when added to mouse organotypic hippocampal brain slices. BMDMs induced cell death when added to control slices and exacerbated damage when combined with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), independently of their phenotype. In contrast, vehicle- and M2-BV2-microglia were protective against OGD-induced death. Direct treatment of brain slices with IL-4 (without cell addition) was protective against OGD and induced an M2 phenotype in the slice. In vivo, intracerebral injection of LPS or IL-4 in mice induced microglial phenotypes similar to the phenotypes observed in brain slices and in cultured cells. After injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, microglial cells did not adopt classical M1/ M2 phenotypes, suggesting that another subtype of regulatory phenotype was induced. This study highlights functional differences between macrophages and microglia, in response to brain injury with fundamentally different outcomes, even if both populations were able to adopt M1 or M2 phenotypes. These data suggest that macrophages infiltrating the brain from the periphery after an injury may be cytotoxic, independently of their phenotype, while microglia may be protective. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Brain injury | Inflammation | Macrophages | microglia,100,0,MRC,G0802001,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0.0,2013-05-01

It is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is activated by the protease caspase-1 within a cytosolic molecular complex called the inflammasome. Assembly of this complex is triggered by a range of structurally diverse damage or pathogen associated stimuli, and the signaling pathways through which these act are poorly understood. Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can be reversed by deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs) that remove ubiquitin moieties from the protein thus modifying its fate. DUBs present specificity toward different ubiquitin chain topologies and are crucial for recycling ubiquitin molecules before protein degradation as well as regulating key cellular processes such as protein trafficking, gene transcription, and signaling.Wereport here that small molecule inhibitors of DUB activity inhibit inflammasome activation. Inhibition of DUBs blocked the processing and release of IL-1β in both mouse and human macrophages.DUBactivity was necessary for inflammasome association as DUB inhibition also impairedASColigomerization and caspase-1 activation without directly blocking caspase-1 activity.

Cerebral ischemia is a devastating condition in which the primary injury is caused by reduced blood supply and is therefore sterile. The cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key contributor to ischemic brain injury and central inflammatory responses. The release of IL-1β is regulated by the protease caspase-1, and its activating complex, the inflammasome. Of the known inflammasomes the best characterized, and one that is perceived to sense sterile injury is formed by a pattern recognition receptor called NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing three (NLRP3). A key feature of NLRP3-inflammasome dependent responses in vitro in macrophages is the requirement of an initial priming stimulus by a pathogen (PAMP), or damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) respectively. We sought to determine the inflammatory responses of NLRP3-activating DAMPs on brain derived mixed glial cells in the absence of an initial priming stimulus in vitro. In cultured mouse mixed glia the DAMPs ATP, monosodium urate, and calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals had no effect on the expression of IL-1α or IL-1β and induced release only when the cells were primed with a PAMP. In the absence of priming, these DAMPs did however induce inflammation via the production of IL-6 and CXCL1, and the release of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Furthermore, the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) acted as a priming stimulus on glial cells resulting in levels of IL-1 expression comparable to those induced by the PAMP lipopolysaccharide. In vivo, after cerebral ischemia, IL-1 production contributed to increased IL-6 and CXCL1 since these cytokines were profoundly reduced in the ischemic hemispheres from IL-1α/β double KO mice, although injury-induced cytokine responses were not abolished.Thus, DAMPs augment brain inflammation by directly stimulating production of glial derived inflammatory mediators. This is markedly enhanced by DAMP-induced IL-1-release-dependent responses that require a sterile endogenous priming stimulus such as SAA. © 2012 Savage, Lopez-Castejon, Denes and Brough.",Caspase-1 | Cerebral ischemia | Inflammation | Interleukin-1 | NLRP3-inflammasome | Priming,121,1,FP7,201024,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,0.0,2012-12-01

Treatment options are limited and animal models of SAH do not always mimic key pathophysiological hallmarks of the disease, thus hindering development of new therapeutics. Inflammation is strongly associated with brain injury after SAH in animals and patients, and inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) represents a possible therapeutic target. Here we report that a rupture of the middle cerebral artery in the rat produces heterogeneous infarct patterns similar to those observed in human SAH. Administration of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) reduced blood-brain barrier breakdown, and the extent of breakdown correlated with brain injury. After SAH, haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was strongly expressed around the bleed site and in the cortex and striatum, indicating the presence of free haem, a breakdown product of haemoglobin. HO-1 expression was also found in the same regions as microglial/macrophage expression of IL-1α. The direct effect of haem on IL-1α expression was confirmed in vitro using organotypic slice culture (OSC). Haem-induced cell death was dependent on IL-1 signalling, with IL-1Ra completely blocking cellular injury. Furthermore, stimulation of mouse primary mixed glial cells with haem induced the release of IL-1α, but not IL-1β. Thus, we suggest that haem, released from lysed red blood cells (RBCs) in the subarachnoid space, acts as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) driving IL-1-dependent inflammation. These data provide new insights into inflammation after SAH-induced brain injury and suggest IL-1Ra as a candidate therapeutic for the disease.",,83,1,MRC,G0801040,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0.5,2012-11-01

Genetic animal models of obesity (ob/ob and db/db mice) display altered centrally-mediated sickness behaviour in response to acute inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, the effect of diet-induced obesity (DIO) on the anorectic and febrile response to LPS in mice is unknown. This study therefore determined how DIO and ob/ob mice respond to a systemic inflammatory challenge. C57BL/6 DIO and ob/ob mice, and their respective controls, were given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS. Compared with controls, DIO and ob/ob mice exhibited an altered febrile response to LPS (100 μg/kg) over 8 hours. LPS caused a greater and more prolonged anorexic effect in DIO compared with control mice and, in ob/ob mice, LPS induced a reduction in food intake and body weight earlier than it did in controls. These effects of LPS in obese mice were also seen after a fixed dose of LPS (5 μg). LPS (100 μg/kg) induced Fos protein expression in several brain nuclei of control mice, with fewer Fos-positive cells observed in the brains of obese mice. An altered inflammatory response to LPS was also observed in obese mice compared with controls: changes in cytokine expression and release were detected in the plasma, spleen, liver and peritoneal macrophages in obese mice. In summary, DIO and ob/ob mice displayed an altered behavioural response and cytokine release to systemic inflammatory challenge. These findings could help explain why obese humans show increased sensitivity to infections. © 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",,56,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2012-09-01

Thus, caspase-1 is regarded as a key mediator of inflammatory processes, and has become synonymous with inflammation. In addition to the processing of IL-1b, caspase-1 also executes a rapid programme of cell death, termed pyroptosis, in macrophages in response to intracellular bacteria. Pyroptosis is also regarded as a host response to remove the niche of the bacteria and to hasten their demise. These processes are generally accepted as the main roles of caspase-1. However, there is also a wealth of literature supporting a direct role for caspase-1 in non-infectious cell death processes. This is true in mammals, but also in nonmammalian vertebrates where caspase-1-dependent processing of IL-1b is absent because of the lack of appropriate caspase-1 cleavage sites. This literature is most prevalent in the brain where caspase-1 may directly regulate neuronal cell death in response to diverse insults. We attempt here to summarise the evidence for caspase-1 as a cell death enzyme and propose that, in addition to the processing of IL-1b, caspase-1 has an important and a conserved role as a cell death protease. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",caspase-1 | inflammasome | inflammation,174,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.5,2012-07-01

Following invasion L. monocytogenes escapes the phagosome and replicates in the cytoplasm. Phagosome escape is central to L. monocytogenes virulence and is required for initiating innate host-defence responses such as the secretion of the cytokine interleukin-1. Phagosome escape of L. monocytogenes is reported to depend upon host proteins such as γ-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The host cytosolic cysteine protease calpain is required in the life cycle of numerous pathogens, and previous research reports an activation of calpain by L. monocytogenes infection. Thus we sought to determine whether host calpain was required for the virulence of L. monocytogenes. Treatment of macrophages with calpain inhibitors blocked escape of L. monocytogenes from the phagosome and consequently its proliferation within the cytosol. This was independent of any direct effect on the production of bacterial virulence factors or of a bactericidal effect. Furthermore, the secretion of interleukin-1β, a host cytokine whose secretion induced by L. monocytogenes depends upon phagosome escape, was also blocked by calpain inhibition. These data indicate that L. monocytogenes co-opts host calpain to facilitate its escape from the phagosome, and more generally, that calpain may represent a cellular Achilles heel exploited by pathogens. © 2012 Lopez-Castejon et al.",,12,1,MRC,G0601205,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0.0,2012-04-01

Here, we show that the endogenous lipid metabolite sphingosine (Sph) acts as a DAMP by inducing the NLRP3-inflammasome-dependent secretion of IL-1β from macrophages. This process was dependent upon serine/threonine protein phosphatases since the PP1/PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A inhibited Sph-induced IL-1β release. IL-1β release induced by other well-characterized NLRP3-inflammasome activators, such as ATP and uric acid crystals, in addition to NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasome activators was also blocked by these inhibitors.

The cytokines interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and IL-1β are key contributors to ischemic brain injury. However, there is very little evidence that IL-1 expression occurs at the protein level early enough (within hours) to influence brain damage after stroke. In order to determine this we investigated the temporal and spatial profiles of IL-1α and IL-1β expression after cerebral ischemia.Findings: We report here that in mice, as early as 4 h after reperfusion following ischemia induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, IL-1α, but not IL-1β, is expressed by microglia-like cells in the ischemic hemisphere, which parallels an upregulation of IL-1α mRNA. 24 h after ischemia IL-1α expression is closely associated with areas of focal blood brain barrier breakdown and neuronal death, mostly near the penumbra surrounding the infarct. The sub-cellular distribution of IL-1α in injured areas is not uniform suggesting that it is regulated.Conclusions: The early expression of IL-1α in areas of focal neuronal injury suggests that it is the major form of IL-1 contributing to inflammation early after cerebral ischemia. This adds to the growing body of evidence that IL-1α is a key mediator of the sterile inflammatory response. © 2011 Luheshi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,99,1,WT,201024,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0.5,2011-12-01

Essential for the host-response and resistance to pathogens, it also exacerbates damage during chronic disease and acute tissue injury. It is not surprising therefore that there is a huge level of interest in how this protein is produced and exported from cells. However, the mechanism of IL-1β release has proven to be elusive. It does not follow the conventional ER-Golgi route of secretion. A literature full of disparate observations arising from numerous experimental systems, has contributed to a complicated mix of diverse proposals. Here we summarise these observations and propose that secretion of IL-1β occurs on a continuum, dependent upon stimulus strength and the extracellular IL-1β requirement. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Caspase-1 | Cell death | Golgi | IL-1β | Inflammation,471,1,WT,undefined,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0.0,2011-08-01

Sterile inflammationworsens damage in a number of injury paradigms. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1α is reported to be a damage-associated molecular pattern released from dead cells, and it is known to exacerbate brain injury caused by stroke. In the brain, IL-1α is produced by microglia, the resident brain macrophages. We found that IL-1α is actively trafficked to the nuclei of microglia, and hence tested the hypothesis that trafficking of IL-1α to the nucleus would inhibit its release following necrotic cell death, limiting sterile inflammation. Microglia subjected to oxygenglucose deprivation died via necrosis. Under these conditions, microglia expressing nuclear IL-1α released significantly less IL-1α than microglia with predominantly cytosolic IL-1α.

Cytokines are coordinators of inflammation and were originally defined as secreted mediators, released from expressing cells to activate plasma membrane receptors on responsive cells. However, a group of cytokines is now recognized as having dual functionality. In addition to their extracellular effects, these cytokines act inside the nuclei of cytokine-expressing or cytokine-responsive cells. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are key pro-inflammatory mediators, and blockade of the IL-1 system in inflammatory diseases is an attractive therapeutic goal. All current therapies target IL-1 extracellular actions. Here we review evidence that suggests IL-1 family members have dual functionality. Several IL-1 family members have been detected inside the nuclei of IL-1-expressing or IL-1-responsive cells, and intranuclear IL-1 is reported to regulate gene transcription and mRNA splicing. However, further work is required to determine the impact of IL-1 intranuclear actions on disease pathogenesis.

Zinc deficiency is a common consequence of, contributor to, human inflammatory disease. However, the molecular mechanisms through which zinc contributes to inflammatory disease remain largely unknown. We report here that zinc metabolism regulates caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. One of the endogenous mediators of IL-1β secretion is adenosine triphosphate, acting via the P2X7-receptor and caspase-1 activation in cells primed with an inflammatory stimulus such as LPS. We show that this process is selectively abolished by a brief pre-treatment with the zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylene diamine (TPEN). These effects on IL-1β secretion were independent of rapid changes in free zinc within the cell, not a direct effect on caspase-1 activity, and upstream of caspase-1 activation. TPEN did however inhibit the activity of pannexin-1, a hemi-channel critical for adenosine triphosphate and nigericin-induced IL-1β release.

IL-1α and β are produced by cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages, and act largely after their secretion by binding to the type I IL-1 receptor on responsive cells. There is evidence that IL-1α is also a nuclear protein that can act intracellularly. In this study, we report that both IL-1α and IL-1β produced by microglia (central nervous system macrophages) in response to an inflammatory challenge are distributed between the cytosol and the nucleus. Using IL-1-β-galactosidase and IL-1-green fluorescent protein chimeras (analyzed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching), we demonstrate that nuclear import of IL-1α is exclusively active, requiring a nuclear localization sequence and Ran, while IL-1β nuclear import is entirely passive.

However, the mechanisms that control IL-1 release in acute neuronal injury are unknown and the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that neuronal injury induces IL-1β release from microglial cells. Here we report that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated rat microglia co-cultured with healthy rat neurons express pro-IL-1β, which in the absence of cell death accumulates in the cells. Treatment of co-cultures with the excitotoxin N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) induced neuronal cell death leading to the appearance of pro-IL-1β in the culture supernatant. This effect was reversed by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, and was neuron-dependent, since NMDA had no effect on cell death or pro-IL-1β release in mixed glial cell cultures. In addition, we show that pro-IL-1β release from LPS-treated mixed glia or LPS-treated microglia is significantly reduced in the presence of conditioned medium from healthy co-cultures or neuronal cultures respectively. These results demonstrate that injured neurons promote the release of pro-IL-1β from microglia, possibly by regulating microglial cell viability, and suggest an important alternative mechanism of IL-1β release that occurs in response to neuronal injury. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

There are many possible reasons for this failure, including poor design of clinical trials, mismatch between preclinical and clinical protocols, and insufficient preclinical data. The enzyme caspase-1 has been implicated in neuronal death. Deletion of the caspase-1 gene, or administration of partially selective inhibitors, reduces neuronal injury induced by cerebral ischemia in rodents. We report here, for the first time, that VRT-018858, the non-peptide, active metabolite of the selective caspase-1 inhibitor pro-drug, pralnacasan, markedly reduced ischemic injury in rats.

Despite its biological importance, the mechanisms of its processing to an active form and its trafficking to the extracellular compartment remain poorly understood. Interleukin-1β secretion is proposed to occur via several distinct mechanisms including microvesicle shedding and the regulated secretion of lysosomes. In this study, we report for the first time that caspase-1-dependent processing of pro-interleukin-1β can occur in the cytosol following activation of P2X7-receptor. We also provide evidence that the pathway of secretion in this model is independent of the lysosomal trafficking regulator, a protein involved in lysosome secretion. Although release of interleukin-1β occurred before the appearance of significant levels of lactate dehydrogenase in the supernatant, the cells ultimately died. It is clear that structural changes preceding cell death, occurring after caspase-1 activation, promote the cellular release of interleukin-1β. We investigated the involvement of lipid rafts in this process and discovered that depleting the plasma membrane of cholesterol did not adversely affect interleukin-1β secretion in response to ATP.

This rise in Ca 2+ was shown to cause a fall in cellular ATP levels, and the effect of carbachol on organelle movement could be mimicked by depleting ATP with metabolic inhibitors in the absence of any such rise in Ca2+. However, a Ca2+-sensing process independent of ATP appears also to be involved, because we identified conditions where the ATP depletion was blocked (by inhibitors of the Ca2+ pumps), but the organelle movements still ceased following a rise in cytosolic Ca2+. We conclude that the co-ordinated cessation of mitochondria and ER motility is a process regulated by the cytosolic concentration of both Ca2+ and ATP, and that these two parameters are likely to synergize to regulate the localization of the two organelles, and to facilitate the transfer of Ca2+ between them. © 2005 Biochemical Society.",ATP | Calcium signalling | Endoplasmic reticulum | Mitochondria | Organelle movement,76,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2005-12-01

However, such a concept assumes that, once translocated, a protein retains the free mobility it had in the cytoplasm, and also that the possible existence of partitioned pools of inositol lipids does not restrict its sphere of influence. We have explored by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) the mobility of four green-fluorescent-protein-tagged proteins, GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m, when they are either cytoplasmic or attached to the plasma membrane, and the PH domain of PI-PLCδ1 and ICAM as representative of, respectively, another inositol-lipid-anchored protein and a single-transmembrane-span-domain protein. The data from GAP1m and the PI-PLCδ1 PH domain show that, when proteins associate with inositol lipids in the plasma membrane, they retain a mobility similar to that in the cytoplasm, and probably also similar to the inositol lipid to which they are attached, suggesting a free diffusion within the plane of the membrane. Moreover, this free diffusion is similar whether they are bound to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or to PtdIns(4,5)P2, and no evidence was found by these criteria for restricted pools of PtdIns(4,5)P2. The mobility of GAP1IP4BP, which has been reported to associate with PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane, is much lower, suggesting that it might interact with other cellular components.

However, our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms involved is still limited. Inflammatory processes mediated by cytokines, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in particular, play a significant role in neuronal death following pathological insults. Despite this growing area of research, very little is known about the factors regulating the expression, cleavage and release of interleukin-1 in the brain. Recent studies on immune cells demonstrate that extracellular ATP can act as a potent stimulus for the maturation and release of interleukin-1β, via activation of P2X7 receptors. Stimulation of P2X7 receptors with ATP has dramatic cytotoxic properties and a wider role in neurodegenerative processes is possible. This review discusses the potential involvement of extracellular ATP and P2X7 receptors as regulators of interleukin-1-mediated neuropathologies and thus as a mediator of cell death following pathological insults. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Resveratrol is a well-known antioxidant but has also been reported to bind to Aβ1–42 peptide, thereby reducing aggregation. However, little is known of the precise mechanism by which resveratrol reduces Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation. Using the thioflavin-T assay, the ability of resveratrol to reduce the extent of Aβ1–42 peptide aggregation was investigated. The findings of the present study demonstrate that interaction of resveratrol with Aβ1–42 peptide resulted in the cleavage of Aβ1–42 peptide into smaller fragments, as detected by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Atomic force microscopy analyses revealed Aβ1–42 peptide, under control conditions, aggregated into oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrils, whereas there was a distinct lack of these structures when Aβ1–42 peptide was incubated with resveratrol. Following 10 days incubation of Aβ1–42 peptide with resveratrol, particles with a mean z-height of 1.940 nm (range 0.675–3.275 nm) were observed, which are characteristic of shorter peptide species. In cell-based studies, resveratrol significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of Aβ1–42 peptide toward SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, suggesting a protective effect of the polyphenol.

Bestrophinopathies are a group of untreatable inherited retinal dystrophies caused by mutations in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) Cl− channel bestrophin 1. We tested whether sodium phenylbutyrate (4PBA) could rescue the function of mutant bestrophin 1 associated with autosomal dominant and recessive disease. We then sought analogues of 4PBA with increased potency and determined the mode of action for 4PBA and a lead compound 2-naphthoxyacetic acid (2-NOAA). Lastly, we tested if 4PBA and 2-NOAA could functionally rescue bestrophin 1 function in RPE generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-RPEs) derived from patients with a dominant or recessive bestrophinopathy. METHODS. Global and plasma membrane expression was determined by Western blot and immunofluorescent microscopy, respectively. The effect of 4PBA and 2-NOAA on transcription was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and the rate of protein turnover by cycloheximide chase and Western blot. Channel function was measured by whole-cell patch clamp. RESULTS. 4PBA and 2-NOAA can rescue the global and membrane expression of mutant bestrophin 1 associated with autosomal dominant disease (Best vitelliform macular dystrophy [BVMD]) and autosome recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB), and these small molecules have different modes of action. Both 4PBA and 2-NOAA significantly increased the channel function of mutant BVMD and ARB bestrophin 1 in HEK293T and iPSC-RPE cells derived from patients with BVMD and ARB. For 4PBA, the increased mutant channel function in BVMD and ARB iPSC-RPE was equal to that of wild-type iPSC-RPE bestrophin 1. CONCLUSIONS.

Thus, there is a need to develop inhibitors of NQO2 that are active in vitro and in vivo. As part of a strategy to achieve this we have used the 4-aminoquinoline backbone as a starting point and synthesized 21 novel analogues. The syntheses utilised p-anisidine with Meldrum's acid and trimethyl orthoacetate or trimethyl orthobenzoate to give the 4-hydrazin-quinoline scaffold, which was derivatised with aldehydes or acid chlorides to give hydrazone or hydrazide analogues, respectively. The hydrazones were the most potent inhibitors of NQO2 in cell free systems, some with low nano-molar IC50 values. Structure-activity analysis highlighted the importance of a small substituent at the 2-position of the 4-aminoquinoline ring, to reduce steric hindrance and improve engagement of the scaffold within the NQO2 active site. Cytotoxicity and NQO2–inhibitory activity in vitro was evaluated using ovarian cancer SKOV-3 and TOV-112 cells (expressing high and low levels of NQO2, respectively). Generally, the hydrazones were more toxic than hydrazide analogues and further, toxicity is unrelated to cellular NQO2 activity. Pharmacological inhibition of NQO2 in cells was measured using the toxicity of CB1954 as a surrogate end-point. Both the hydrazone and hydrazide derivatives are functionally active as inhibitors of NQO2 in the cells, but at different inhibitory potency levels. In particular, 4-((2-(6-methoxy-2-methylquinolin-4-yl)hydrazono)methyl)phenol has the greatest potency of any compound yet evaluated (53 nM), which is 50-fold lower than its toxicity IC50.

Naproxen was conjugated to G3 in different ratios and to G0 in a 1:1 ratio via a diethylene glycol linker. A lauroyl chain (L), a lipophilic permeability enhancer, was attached to G3 and G0 prodrugs. The G3 and G0 conjugates were more hydrophilic than naproxen as evaluated by the measurement of partitioning between 1-octanol and a phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and pH 1.2. The unmodified surface PAMAM-NAP conjugates showed significant solubility enhancements of NAP at pH 1.2; however, with the number of NAP conjugated to G3, this was limited to 10 molecules. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay indicated that the G3 dendrimer conjugates had a concentration dependent toxicity towards Caco-2 cells. Attaching naproxen to the surface of the dendrimer increased the IC50 of the resulting prodrugs towards Caco-2 cells. The lauroyl G3 conjugates showed the highest toxicity amongst the PAMAM dendrimer conjugates investigated and were significantly more toxic than the lauroyl-G0-naproxen conjugates. The permeability of naproxen across monolayers of Caco-2 cells was significantly increased by its conjugation to either G3 or G0 PAMAM dendrimers. Lauroyl-G0 conjugates displayed considerably lower cytotoxicity than G3 conjugates and may be preferable for use as a drug carrier for low soluble drugs such as naproxen.",Caco-2 cells | Dendrimer prodrugs | Oral drug delivery | PAMAM dendrimers | Transepithelial transport,10,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2017-10-01

In this study, we undertook a systematic structure activity investigation to optimise this lead compound to improve its in vitro anti-tumour activity and biocompatibility. A series of D-tryptophan (D-Trp) derivatives were synthesised, with a range of aliphatic N-alkyl chains (methyl to pentyl) on the indole nitrogen (Nind). These were incorporated into the pentapeptide sequence by substitution of the Nind-tert-prenylated D-Trp 4th residue with the Nind-alkylated D-Trp derivatives. These pentapeptides were significantly more potent than tert-Prenyl4th-NH2, with the Nind-butyl modification generating the most cytotoxic peptides. Compared to tert-Prenyl4th-NH2, a single butyl modification on the 4th D-Trp residue (Butyl4th-NH2) showed a ∼3 fold enhancement in cytotoxicity in either the chemo-naive H69 or the DMS79 (originating from a patient treated with chemotherapeutics and radiation therapy) SCLC cell lines. In addition, the di-butylated sequence on the 2nd and 4th D-Trp residues (Butyl2nd,4th-NH2) gave ∼4.5 times higher cytotoxicity against the H69 cell line and a ∼2 fold increase against the DMS79 cell line, compared to tert-Prenyl4th-NH2. The favoured position for butyl modification was the 4th D-Trp residue, as the Butyl2nd-NH2 peptide gave lower cytotoxicity on both cell lines. Butylated peptide sequences, when exposed to neat mouse plasma for 24 h at 37 °C, were found to resist degradation with >80% remaining intact compared to ∼58% for tert-Prenyl4th-NH2. The degradation pathway in plasma occurs via de-amidation of the C-terminus, confirmed by mass spectrometry and RP-HPLC analysis. The butyl modification also conferred resistance to metabolism when tested using S9 liver fraction from mouse. The optimum analogue responsive against the DMS79 cell line was the Butyl4th-NH2 pentapeptide, which revealed a concentration dependent increase in apoptosis: the level of late apoptotic cells rose from ∼36% at 2 μM to ∼96% at 6 μM, as determined by flow cytometry, compared to the unmodified peptide that showed no such effect. Concluding, the butyl substitutions offered the best perspective for high cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis and metabolic compatibility thereby comprising an improved broad spectrum SP antagonist candidate for treatment of SCLC.",Cytotoxicity | Lung cancer | N-alkylated indoles | Pentapeptides,2,1,,MC_PC_13070,,papers by authors,1.0,2017-01-01

To exploit this discovery for developing new peptide therapeutics, we report the first studies whereby incorporation of prenylated indoles into primary sequences has been achieved. We developed a route to synthesise Nα-Fmoc-protected tryptophan derivatives in which the prenyl group is linked to the N-indole core, using Pd(ii)-mediated C-H functionalisation of 2-methyl-2-butene. Based on the Substance P antagonist G (SPG), a well-known Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) anticancer agent, we designed a new penta-peptide sequence to include a prenyl moiety on one of the tryptophan residues. The N-tert-prenylated tryptophan analogue was assembled into the pentameric peptide using standard solid phase peptide synthesis or liquid phase synthesis by fragment coupling. In vitro screening showed that the N-tert-prenylation of the indole ring on the tryptophan residue located near the C-terminal of the penta-peptide enhanced the cytotoxicity against H69 (IC50 = 2.84 ± 0.14 μM) and DMS79 (IC50 = 4.37 ± 0.44 μM) SCLC cell lines when compared with the unmodified penta-peptide (H69, IC50 = 30.74 ± 0.30 μM and DMS79, IC50 = 23.00 ± 2.07 μM) or the parent SPG sequence (IC50 > 30 μM, both cell lines). SCLC almost invariably relapses with therapy-resistant disease. The DMS79 cell line was established from a patient following treatment with a number of chemotherapeutics (cytoxan, vincristine and methotrexate) and radiation therapy. Treating DMS79 tumour-bearing nude mice provided a human xenograft model of drug resistance to test the efficacy of the prenylated peptide. A low dose (1.5 mg kg−1) of the prenylated peptide was found to reduce tumour growth by ∼30% (P < 0.05) at day 7, relative to the control group receiving vehicle only. We conclude that the availability of the Fmoc-Trp(N-tert-prenyl)-OH amino acid facilitates the synthesis of prenylated-tryptophan-containing peptides to explore their therapeutic potential.",,8,1,MRC,MC_PC_13070,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1.5,2017-01-01

A pathway for the synthesis of the non-symmetrical furan-amidines was established from the corresponding 1,4-diketones. The synthesized non-symmetrical furan-amidines and their analogues showed potent NQO2 inhibition activity with nano-molar IC50 values. The most active compounds were non-symmetrical furan-amidines with meta- and para-nitro substitution on the aromatic ring, with IC50 values of 15 nM. In contrast to the symmetric furan-amidines, which showed potent intercalation in the minor grooves of DNA, the synthesized non-symmetrical furan-amidines showed no affinity towards DNA, as demonstrated by DNA melting temperature experiments. In addition, Plasmodium parasites, which possess their own quinone oxidoreductase PfNDH2, were inhibited by the non-symmetrical furan-amidines, the most active possessing a para-fluoro substituent (IC50 9.6 nM).

Integrating knowledge and skills from diverse disciplines can be a challenge and supporting students in this was a priority for the school. Team Based Learning (TBL) has been used as an active learning strategy to promote a supportive learning environment where students work in small groups to solve case-based problems. Aims: The aim was to describe how TBL was introduced to students during their induction and to describe the student response. Method: The first year of the undergraduate pharmacy programme started with a week-long induction comprising four TBL sessions, designed in part to set out the expectation of integrating pharmaceutical science and pharmacy practice knowledge and introducing the Code of Conduct for pharmacy students. The student experience of TBL was determined using an online survey and the marks students achieved in the assessments. Results: The students' individual assessment means were 72%, 80% and 49%, whilst the team means were 96%, 97% and 74%. Five themes emerged from the students comments on TBL which were: comfort, how TBL helped learning, assessing too early in the programme, preparation time and having the opportunity to meet others on the programme. Conclusion: The students responded positively to TBL in the induction. The TBL sessions set the expectation of pre- learning/preparation for all teaching sessions and science-practice integration throughout the programme. TBL also allowed students to engage with a greater number of their peers than would have been possible with more didactic forms of teaching. © 2014 FIP.",Induction | Integrated curriculum | Team based learning,2,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1.5,2014-01-01

It adopts a conformationally restricted chair with two indomethacin groups in the sterically hindered 1,3-diaxial positions. Acid-induced cleavage of the orthoacetate lock of the prodrug leads to a ring flip of the myo-inositol ring with the two indomethacin groups now in 1,3-diequatorial positions. This increases the susceptibility of hydrolysis of the ester groups to release indomethacin under acidic conditions.

Some of these derivatives have gained popularity as so-called recreational 'legal highs' due to their availability on the Internet and high street shops. A previous study described the qualitative analysis of 24 'legal high' Energy-1 (NRG-1) and NRG-2 products obtained from 18 websites following the ban on mephedrone and derivatives in April 2010. The majority of these products contained a mixture of cathinones just carrying a new label. Here, three additional cathinone products have been detected; two from an NRG-1 sample and one from an NRG-3 sample. This report describes their identification. NRG-1 sample 1 consisted of a mixture of 4 cathinones namely 4-fluoromethcathinone (1), 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)pentan-1-one (pentylone, 2), 3,4-methylenedioxy-α-pyrrolidinobutyrophenone (MDPBP, 3) and 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV, 4). The sample labelled as NRG-3 (mislabelled with the chemical structure of mephedrone) consisted of a mixture of 4-methyl-α-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (MPPP, 5) and (2), whereas the remaining NRG-1 sample 2 (also mislabelled with the chemical structure of mephedrone) consisted of a mixture of (2) and (3). Qualitative analyses were carried out by GC-(EI/CI)-MS, NMR spectroscopy and confirmation by preparation of standards. The preparation of brominated precursors carrying the 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl nucleus revealed extensive α,α-dibromination: the mass spectral and NMR data of these intermediates are also presented and discussed. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Cathinones | Legal highs | Mephedrone | Naphyrone | NRG-1 | NRG-3,108,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2011-09-01

In this work we report the first thermodynamic data of the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox potential in the presence of Ins(1,2,3)P3 which demonstrate the capability of this ligand to inhibit iron(III) reduction in the intracellular media. The Fe 3+-Ins(1,2,3)P3 speciation was also studied by 31P NMR measurements, focusing on the structure of the complexes. The work is completed by theoretical calculations which lead us to predict the geometries of the species at different pH values and their relative stabilities.

Ins(1,2,3)P3 is probably an important safe chelator of iron cations not strongly bound to proteins. In order to clarify its biological functions, Ins(1,2,3)P3 chemistry under physiological conditions must be completely elucidated. The protonation and complexation behaviour of Ins(1,2,3)P3 has been recently studied under these conditions by potentiometry. Under simulated physiological conditions it forms the protonated species H2L 4- and H3L3-. The presence of high concentrations of potassium in intracellular compartments causes the formation of two predominant Ins(1,2,3)P3 complexes: [K(HL)]4- and [K(H2L)]3-, in the absence of iron. In this work we expand part of this macroscopic knowledge to the inframolecular level, by 31P NMR measurements and focusing on the protonation and complexation of this biologically relevant molecule to potassium.

The synthesis was carried out under reductive amination conditions between tryptamine and aqueous formaldehyde in the presence of acetic acid followed by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride. Analytical characterization of this synthetic route was carried out by gas chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry using electron- and chemical-ionization modes. Methanol was employed as a liquid CI reagent and the impact of stoichiometric modifications on side-products formation was also investigated.

Replacement of formaldehyde solution with paraformaldehyde resulted in incomplete conversion of the starting material whereas a similar replacement of sodium cyanoborohydride with sodium borohydride almost exclusively produced THBC instead of the expected DMT. Compounds 1 to 7 were quantified and the limits of detection were 28.4, 87.7, 21.5, 23.4, 41.1, 36.6, and 34.9 ngmL-1, respectively. The limits of quantification for compounds 1 to 7 were 32.4, 88.3, 25.4, 24.6, 41.4, 39.9, and 37.0 μg mL-1, respectively. Linearity was observed in the range of 20.8-980 μg mL-1 with correlation coefficients >0.99.

The simplest derivative, myo-inositol 1,2,3-trisphosphate [Ins(1,2,3)P3], has been proposed as an intracellular iron chelator involved in iron transport. The binding conformation of Ins(1,2,3)P3 is considered to be important to complex Fe3+ in a 'safe' manner. Here, a pyrene-based fluorescent probe, 4,6-bispyrenoyl-myo-inositol 1,2,3,5-tetrakisphosphate [4,6-bispyrenoyl Ins(1,2,3,5)P4], has been synthesised and used to monitor the conformation of the 1,2,3-trisphosphate motif using excimer fluorescence emission. Ring-flip of the cyclohexane chair to the penta-axial conformation occurs upon association with Fe3+, evident from excimer fluorescence induced by π-π stacking of the pyrene reporter groups, accompanied by excimer formation by excitation at 351 nm. This effect is unique amongst biologically relevant metal cations, except for Ca 2+ cations exceeding a 1:1 molar ratio. In addition, the thermodynamic constants for the interaction of the fluorescent probe with Fe3+ have been determined. The complexes formed between Fe 3+ and 4,6-bispyrenoyl Ins(1,2,3,5)P4 display similar stability to those formed with Ins(1,2,3)P3, indicating that the fluorescent probe acts as a good model for the 1,2,3-trisphosphate motif. This is further supported by the antioxidant properties of 4,6-bispyrenoyl Ins(1,2,3,5)P4, which closely resemble those obtained for Ins(1,2,3)P3. The data presented confirms that Fe3+ binds tightly to the unstable penta-axial conformation of myo-inositol phosphates possessing the 1,2,3-trisphosphate motif. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,6,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2010-06-01

N-dialkylation of the nitrogen side chain can result in derivatives with psychoactive and hallucinogenic properties that are accessible by a large number of synthetic procedures.The renewed interest in human clinical studies coincides with increased public interest and exchange of information on the Internet, including discussion in scientific, popular and clandestine literature. Over the past few years, an increasing number of case reports have attracted the attention of clinical, pharmaceutical, forensic and public-health communities, underlining the current lack of pharmaco-toxicological and analytical data.This review assesses the current state of knowledge about the analytical profiling of drugs and by-products obtained from synthetic procedures discussed on Internet websites and scientific literature. Due to space considerations, we focus on detection using mass spectrometry (MS). We discuss commonalities and differences when considering fragmentation under a variety of ionization conditions and mass analysis using single-stage and multi-stage modes of MS.Key features of mass-spectral fragmentation include formation of iminium-ion CnH2n+2N+, normally assumed to be represented by appropriately substituted CH2N+(R1R2) species. Isomeric derivatives can often be differentiated by secondary and tertiary fragmentations that form CnH2n+2N+ species after loss of neutrals. Soft-ionization techniques (e.g., electrospray) are often characterized by intense [3-vinylindole]+-type species that reflect the extent of substitution on the indole ring. The fact that some tryptamines were found sensitive to halogenated solvents reminds the analyst to be aware of the potential for misinterpreting data when investigating the presence of route-specific impurities. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Clinical | Drug synthesis | Forensic | Fragmentation | Hallucinogen | Mass analysis | Mass spectrometry | Pharmaceutical | Soft ionization | Tryptamine,21,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.5,2010-04-01

The present study reports on the characterisation of the second step of this procedure which was based on the methylation of tryptamine.

However, the dendrimer was unable to enhance TCN solubility at lower pH values and the solubilising effect observed was attributed to the ionization of TCN (pKa 8.14) resulting from dendrimer induced pH changes.

This particular attribute attracts great interest from a variety of scientific and also clandestine communities. Our recent research has confirmed that DMT reacts with dichloromethane (DCM), either as a result of work-up or storage to give a quaternary N-chloromethyl ammonium salt 2a. Furthermore, this was observed to undergo rearrangement during analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) with products including 3-(2-chloroethyl)indole 3 and 2-methyltetrahydro-β-carboline 4 (2-Me-THBC). This study further investigates this so far unexplored area of solvent interactions by the exposure of DMT to other halogenated solvents including dibromomethane and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE). The N-bromomethyl- and N-chloroethyl quaternary ammonium derivatives were subsequently characterised by ion trap GC-MS in electron and chemical ionisation tandem MS mode and by NMR spectroscopy. The DCE-derived derivative formed at least six rearrangement products in the total ion chromatogram. Identification of mass spectrometry generated by-products was verified by conventional or microwave-accelerated synthesis. The use of deuterated DCM and deuterated DMT 1b provided insights into the mechanism of the rearrangements. The presence of potentially characteristic marker molecules may allow the identification of solvents used during the manufacture of controlled substances, which is often neglected since these are considered inert. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Routes for clandestine synthesis are described on Internet websites one of which involves the thermolytic decarboxylation of tryptophan to tryptamine as a precursor to psychoactive compounds. High boiling solvents and ketone catalysts have been employed to facilitate the decarboxylation of tryptophan. The present study has revealed that there is formation of tetrahydro-β-carboline (THBC) derivatives which may originate from reaction with both the solvent and the ketone catalyst. The application of gas chromatography electron- and chemical-ionisation ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (GC-IT-MS-MS), in combination with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), led to the isolation and identification of 1,1-disubstituted-tetrahydro-β-carbolines formed as major impurities in the tryptamine. Confirmation was by synthesis of the THBC derivatives from tryptamine using Pictet-Spengler cyclisation. Under EI-conditions, mass spectral characterisation of the THBCs suggests predominance of alkyl cleavage. These impurities will yield a useful profile for identification of the synthetic pathway and likely reagents employed, particularly a ""fingerprint"" of the ketone catalyst and an insight into the influence of solvents and catalysts on the formation of by-products. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A solvent dependency is observed that has to be taken into consideration for the unambiguous assignment of 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts. The 1H-NMR study demonstrated that one can evaluate the rotamer populations of the asymmetrical glyoxalylamides. In a forensic or clinical scenario where single or multiple reaction monitoring approaches are contemplated, the appropriate ion transitions of choice may then focus on the two main fragmentations, namely β-cleavage ([M+H]+ → CH2N+R2R3) and/or α-cleavage ([M+H]+ → [3-vinylindole]+), respectively.

Earlier studies have shown that the IMPase-catalyzed hydrolysis of myo-inositol monophosphates to inorganic phosphate and myo-inositol proceeds by direct attack of water at phosphorus. However, research groups have independently proposed either an in-line displacement (with inversion of stereochemistry at phosphorus) or an adjacent attack with a pseudorotation (with retention of stereochemistry at phosphorus). Here, the elucidation of the stereochemical pathway is presented. The IMPase-catalyzed hydrolysis of D-1-Sp-myo-inositol [17O]-thiophosphate in the presence of H218O gave inorganic Rp-[16O, 17O, 18O]-thiophosphate, with inversion of configuration at phosphorus. This is only consistent with an in-line displacement, and it rules out the controversial adjacent/pseudorotation mechanism. This result will assist in the design of alternative inhibitors of IMPase.",,9,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,2002-03-01

A similarity model of human thymidine phosphorylase was built, based on the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli enzyme. The high residue conservation between the two enzyme sources (39% sequence identity and 53% sequence similarity) aided model building. The human model was very similar to the E. coli enzyme's crystal structure, with the main tertiary structure difference being the destruction of helix 15 in E. coli by the presence of a loop in the human model. The model was used to rationalize the nature of the binding of the substrates thymine and thymidine, and of known inhibitors using a quantitative docking algorithm. Ab initio calculations on the nM inhibitor 5-chloro-6-(1-(2-iminopyrrolidinyl)methyl)uracil hydrochloride gave its conformation and distribution of charge.

We have studied the regulation of whole-cell chloride current in T84 colonic epithelial cells by inositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(3,4,5,6)P4). New information was obtained using (a) microcystin and okadaic acid to inhibit serine/threonine protein phosphatases, and (b) a novel functional tetrakisphosphate analogue, 1,2-bisdeoxy-1,2-bisfluoro-Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (i.e. F2-Ins(3,4,5,6)P4). 2. Calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) increased chloride current 20-fold. This current (I(Cl,CaMK)) continued for 7 ± 1.2 min before its deactivation, or running down, by approximately 60%. This run-down was prevented by okadaic acid, whereupon I(Cl,CaMK) remained near its maximum value for ≤ 14.3 ± 0.6 min. 3. F2-Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 inhibited I(Cl,CaMK) (IC50 = 100 μM) stereo-specifically since its enantiomer, F2-Ins(1,4,5,6)P4 had no effect at ≤ 500 μM. Dose-response data (Hill coefficient = 1.3) showed that F2-Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 imitated only the non-co-operative phase of inhibition by Ins(3,4,5,6)P4, and not the co-operative phase. 4. Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 was prevented from blocking I(Cl,CaMK) by okadaic acid (IC50 = 1.5 nM) and microcystin (IC50 = 0.15 nM); these data lead to the novel conclusion that, in situ, protein phosphatase activity is essential for Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 to function. The IC50 values indicate that more than one species of phosphatase was required. One of these may be PP1, since F2-Ins(3,4,5,6)P4-dependent current blocking was inhibited by okadaic acid and microcystin with IC50 values of 70 nM and 0.15 nM, respectively.",,48,0,NIGMS,R01GM036823,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,papers by authors,0.0,1998-08-01

In this study the role of DCE metabolites in the generation of the hepatotoxic lesion was investigated. Hepatocytes from male BALB/c mice in suspension were used as the experimental model. Cells were incubated with DCE for up to 5 hr and cellular viability was assessed by measurement of the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium and by alterations in the reduction of the dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide. After incubation for 3 hr DCE at 0.5 mM caused maximal toxicity, whereas at 0.1 mM DCE was only marginally toxic. Cytotoxicity was exacerbated by pretreatment of mice with buthionine sulfoximine (1.6 g/kg), an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, given 4 hr prior to hepatocyte isolation. Inclusion of N-acetylcysteine (10 mM) into the incubate protected cells against DCE-induced cytotoxicity. Coincubation with octylamine (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of cytochrome P450, abolished the cytotoxic potential of 0.5 mM DCE during incubation for 3 hr. DCE toxicity was increased in hepatocytes from mice which had received ethanol or acetone in their drinking water, both of which induce levels of the hepatic cytochrome P450 isozyme P450 2E1. Incubation of cells with the P450 2E1 inhibitors N,N-dimethylformamide (10 mM) or diethyldithiocarbamate (100 μM) protected liver cells against the detrimental effect of DCE. Pretreatment of animals with phenobarbital, which induces the P450 2B subfamily, or 3-methylcholan-threne, which induces P450 1A1, did not affect the degree of hepatocytotoxicity elicited by DCE. The DCE metabolites chloroacetic acid and dichloroacetaldehyde at 0.75 mM were toxic toward the cells; however, their toxic potency was inferior to that of DCE. Dichloroacetic acid, another product of metabolic DCE oxidation, and S-(chloroacetyl)glutathione and glutathionylacetylglutathione, both of which are generated by conjugation of DCE metabolites with glutathione, at concentrations of up to 5 mM did not interfere with hepatocyte viability. The results suggest that (i) DCE undergoes metabolic toxification in mouse hepatocytes, (ii) P450 2E1 is responsible for the metabolic activation of DCE, and (iii) conjugation with glutathione is a detoxification step. © 1993 by the Society of Toxicology.",,17,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,1993-08-01

In the present study the hypothesis was tested that metabolism of ether lipids acts as a detoxification process. [31P]-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to study the metabolism of the ether lipid SRI 62-834 (SRI) and the phosphate ester hexadecylphosphocholine (HPC) in the presence of both isolated phospholipases C and D and post-mitochondrial rat liver homogenate. Both SRI and HPC were slowly metabolised by phospholipase D to their alkyl phosphates and choline, and the alkyl phosphates were subsequently metabolised by phosphatase to yield the alcohols and inorganic phosphate. These studies failed to detect any metabolism of either SRI or HPC by phospholipase C, and the metabolism of platelet-activating factor (PAF) by this enzyme was not inhibited by the addition of either compound. The cytotoxicity of SRI, the related compound HPC and their metabolites was determined in vitro using three cell lines. Cytotoxicity was measured by analysis of cell growth kinetics, MTT assay and lactate dehydrogenase release. Closely similar results were obtained in the JB1 rat hepatoma cell line, in the non-transformed BL8 rat hepatocyte cell line, and in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. SRI was the most toxic of the compounds analysed, the concentration required to produce 50% toxicity or growth inhibition (IC50) being 6-9 μm. The putative metabolite of SRI, 2,2′-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran, and the known metabolites [2′-(octadecyloxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-2′-yl]methyl phosphate and 2-hydroxymethyl-2-octadecyloxymethyltetrahydrofuran exhibited IC50 values of >200, >100 and 40-70 μm, respectively, consistent with metabolic detoxification. HPC was more cytotoxic (IC50, 37 μm) than its phosphate metabolite (IC50, 140 μm), but its toxicity was similar to that of its metabolite hexadecanol (IC50, 28 μm), suggesting that only the former metabolic route leads to detoxification. © 1992 Springer-Verlag.",,11,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0.0,1992-03-01

At pD 8.0 and 37 °C, both series of compounds hydrolyse with half-lives greater than 24 h to the corresponding mono(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters 5 (X = H or MeO 2C, R = Me, Et, Pr, Pri Bu or But) which were prepared by treatment of the di(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters 4 with sodium or lithium iodide.

The rates of hydrolysis of the mono(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters decrease as the length and steric bulk of the acyl group increases, with half-lives ranging from ∼ 150 h for the acetyl analogues to 2240 h for the pivaloyl derivative. The hydrolyses of the di- and mono-(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters were catalysed by porcine liver carboxyesterase (PLCE), and in all cases the acylate anion was formed. The rate of enzymatic hydrolysis was most rapid for the 4-butanoyloxybenzyl and 4-isobutanoyloxybenzyl analogues. The methoxycarbonyl ester of the phosphonoacetate analogues was not cleaved by PLCE. The methylphosphonate generated from the reaction of 4 (X = H, R = Me) in the presence of esterase and H218O, did not contain 18O attached directly to phosphorus. These results suggest that both the chemical and enzymatic hydrolyses of the mono(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters and the PLCE-catalysed hydrolyses of the di(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters proceed via hydrolysis of the acyl group to give the acylate anion and the unstable 4-hydroxybenzyl esters. The electron-donating 4-hydroxy group facilitates the cleavage of the benzyl-oxygen bond with the formation of the 4-hydroxybenzyl carbonium ion 9, which readily reacts either with water or the phosphate buffer.

The gene encoding the enzyme has been cloned from a subgenomic library from S. hygroscopicus by colony hybridisation using an exact nucleotide probe. An open reading frame has been identified that encodes a protein of molecular mass 32700 Da, in good agreement with the subunit molecular mass of the carboxyphosphonoenolpyruvate mutase recently isolated from this source [Hidaka, T., Imai, S., Hara, O., Anzai, H., Murakami, T., Nagaoka, K. & Seto, H. (1990) J. Bacteriol. 172, 3066–3072]. The gene shares significant sequence similarity with that of phosphoenolpyruvate mutase, an enzyme that catalyses the related interconversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and phosphonopyruvate. When the carboxyphosphonoenolpyruvate‐mutase gene was subcloned into the vector pET11a, the mutase was expressed as about 20% of the total soluble cellular protein in Escherichia coli. The mutase has been purified to homogeneity in three steps in 40% yield. With malate dehydrogenase/NADH, (hydroxyphosphinyl)pyruvate gives (hydroxyphosphinyl)lactate (Kcat 164 s−1 and Km 680 μM) and this spectrophotometric assay for the product of the mutase reaction has been employed in the mechanistic studies. The kinetics for the mutase reaction have been evaluated for the substrate, carboxyphosphonoenolpyruvate, and for the putative reaction intermediate carboxyphosphinopyruvate, both of which have been prepared by chemical synthesis. Carboxyphosphonoenolpyruvate is converted to (hydroxyphosphinyl)pyruvate with a kcat of 0.020 s−1 and a Km of 270 μM, and carboxyphosphinopyruvate is converted to (hydroxyphosphinyl)pyruvate with a kcat of 7.6 × 10−4 s−1 and a Km of 2.2 μM. Although the exogenously added intermediate is not kinetically competent, these results suggest that the mechanism for the mutase reaction involves an initial rearrangement to the intermediate carboxyphosphinopyruvate, followed by decarboxylation to yield the product (hydroxyphosphinyl)pyruvate.

First, from the reaction of the dianion of phenyl (R)-[16O,17O,18O]phosphate with tert-butyl alcohol in acetonitrile, the product tert-butyl [16O,17O,18O]phosphate was 53% Rp. Both the substrate and the product were shown in control experiments to be configurationally stable under the conditions of the reaction. Substantial racemization is consistent with the reaction proceeding via monomeric metaphosphate, but the solvent acetonitrile is potentially nucleophilic and the formation of a transient acetonitrile-metaphosphate adduct could also explain this result. [Indeed, the formation of such an adduct could nicely account for the small extent of retention observed in this experiment.] To avoid such solvent participation, the stereochemical course of a second reaction, that of the dianion of p-nitrophenyl (R)-[16O,17O,18O]phosphate in neat tert-butyl alcohol, has been examined. The product tert-butyl [16O,17O,18O]phosphate was found in this case to be completely racemic under reaction conditions in which both the product and the substrate are configurationally stable. It is clear from these results that phospho group transfer to tert-butyl alcohol can proceed through a symmetrically solvated monomeric metaphosphate intermediate. © 1988, American Chemical Society.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflam-masome is a critical component of the innate immune system. The dysfunction of NLRP3 inflam-masome contributes to various pathogeneses of complex diseases, such as uncontrolled infection, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and metabolic disorders. This review describes recent progress on the discovery of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors and their therapeutic potential. Methods: Based on the mechanism of NLRP3 activation, several types of NLRP3 inhibitors are described and summarized according to their origins, structures, bioactivity, and mechanism of action. Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) is also listed for different scaffolds, as well as effective pharma-cophore. Results: Over one-hundred papers were included in the review. The development of NLRP3 inhibitors has been described from the earliest glyburide in 2001 to the latest progress in 2019. Several series of inhibitors have been categorized, such as JC-series based on glyburide and BC-series based on 2APB. Many other small molecules such as NLRP3 inhibitors are also listed. SAR, application in related therapeutic models, and five different action mechanisms are described. Conclusion: The findings of this review confirmed the importance of developing NLRP3 inflam-masome inhibitors. Various NLRP3 inhibitors have been discovered as effective therapeutic treatments for multiple diseases, such as type II diabetes, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, stress-related mood disorders, etc. The development of a full range of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors is still at its foundational phase.

Such effects are interesting to the biomedical field for the development of therapeutic tools to modulate the immune system. Areas covered: The scope of BCC use to modify immune responses is expanding, mainly with regard to inflammatory diseases. The information was organized to demonstrate the breadth of reported effects. BCCs act as modulators of innate and adaptive immunity, with the former including regulation of cluster differentiation and cytokine production. In addition, BCCs exert effects on inflammation induced by infectious and noninfectious agents, and there are also reports regarding their effects on mechanisms involving hypersensitivity and transplants. Finally, the authors discuss the beneficial effects of BCCs on pathologies involving various targets and mechanisms. Expert opinion: Some BCCs are currently used as drugs in humans. The mechanisms by which these BCCs modulate immune responses, as well as the required structure–activity relationship for each observed mechanism of action, should be clarified. The former will allow for the development of improved immunomodulatory drugs with extensive applications in medicine.

The NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome represents a novel potential target for the treatment of breast cancer. Therefore, it was hypothesized that miR-223-3p may affect tumor growth and immunosuppression in breast cancer by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome. In the present study, an increased expression level of NLRP3 was detected in three breast cancer cell lines compared with normal mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). Suppressing the expression of NLRP3 in MCF-7 cell lines increased the apoptotic rate of breast cancer cells and reduced the proliferative capacity. NLRP3 was identified to be a direct target of miR-233-3p using a luciferase assay. In addition, miR-233-3p mimics inhibited the NLRP3-dependent processes in cancer cells by suppressing the NLRP3 expression level and the protein expression levels of its downstream factors, including PYD and CARD domain containing protein, interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. In vivo experiments demonstrated the suppressive effect of miR-233-3p in tumor growth and immunosuppression. Collectively these findings suggested that the inactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome driven by miR-223-3p reduced the growth and immunosuppression of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo, and may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in treating breast cancer.",Breast cancer | Inflammasome | LRR | MicroRNA-223-3p | NACHT | PYD domains-containing protein 3,18,1,CMU,2015-YQN-09,Capital Medical University,citing papers,0.0,2019-03-01

Fortunately, the use of boric acid for specific purposes remains, and the discovery of natural BCCs with biological action attractive for therapeutic purposes as well as the introduction of some new BCCs for clinical use has reactivated the interest in studying the properties of these BCCs. Methods: We carried out a structured search of bibliographic databases for scientific peer-reviewed research literature regarding boron toxicity and linked that information to that of BCCs in drug design and development. A deductive qualitative content analysis methodology was applied to analyse the interventions and findings of the included studies using a theoretical outline. Results: This review recapitulates the following on a timeline: the boron uses in medicine, the data known about the toxicological profiles of some BCCs, the pharmacological properties of some BCCs that are employed in cancer and infectious disease therapies, and the known properties of BCCs recently introduced into clinical assays as well as the identification of their structure-activity relationships for toxicity and therapeutic use. Then, we discuss the use of new approaches taking advantage of some toxicological data to identify potent and efficient BCCs for prevention and therapy while limiting their toxic effects. Conclusion: Data for boron toxicity can be strategically used for boron-containing drug design.",Boron | Boron-containing compounds | Drug design | Infectious disease therapies | Structure-toxicity relationship | Toxicology,7,0,CONACYT,CB235785,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,citing papers,0.5,2019-01-01

A small amount of water has been found to be crucial in achieving high efficiency in the system. The nickel catalyst system displayed remarkably higher activities to aryl chlorides and mesylates than the corresponding tosylates in cross-coupling with not only diarylborinates but also diarylborinic acids, arylboronic acids, anhydrides and trifluoroborates as indicated in control experiments.
