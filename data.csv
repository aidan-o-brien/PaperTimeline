IL-1β is not secreted through the conventional ER-Golgi route of protein secretion, and to date its mechanism of release has been unknown. Crucially, its secretion depends upon the processing of a precursor form following the activation of the multimolecular inflammasome complex. Using a novel and reversible pharmacological inhibitor of the IL-1β release process, in combination with biochemical, biophysical, and real-time single-cell confocal microscopy with macrophage cells expressing Venus-labelled IL-1β, we have discovered that the secretion of IL-1β after inflammasome activation requires membrane permeabilisation, and occurs in parallel with the death of the secreting cell. Thus, in macrophages the release of IL-1β in response to inflammasome activation appears to be a secretory process independent of nonspecific leakage of proteins during cell death. The mechanism of membrane permeabilisation leading to IL-1β release is distinct from the unconventional secretory mechanism employed by its structural homologues fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) or IL-1α, a process that involves the formation of membrane pores but does not result in cell death. These discoveries reveal key processes at the initiation of an inflammatory response and deliver new insights into the mechanisms of protein release.",,126,1,FP7,DFG-SFB 638,Seventh Framework Programme,origin paper,0,2016-07-01

Its secretion is regulated by the inflammasome, the assembly of which results in caspase 1 activation leading to gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore formation and IL-1β release. During inflammation, danger signals also activate the complement cascade, resulting in the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Here, we report that stimulation of LPS-primed human macrophages with sub-lytic levels of MAC results in activation of the NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and GSDMD-mediated IL-1β release. The MAC is first internalized into endosomes and then colocalizes with inflammasome components; adapter protein apoptosis associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and NLRP3. Pharmacological inhibitors established that MAC-triggered activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was dependent on MAC endocytosis. Internalization of the MAC also caused dispersion of the trans-Golgi network. Thus, these data uncover a role for the MAC in activating the inflammasome and triggering IL-1β release in human macrophages.",complement | IL-1β | inflammasome | macrophage | membrane attack complex | NLRP3,0,1,GSK,undefined,GlaxoSmithKline,papers by authors,0,2021-09-01

They are produced as inactive precursors that are activated by large macromolecular complexes called inflammasomes upon sensing damage or pathogenic signals. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is regarded to require a priming step that causes NLRP3 and IL-1β gene upregulation, and also NLRP3 post-translational licencing. A subsequent activation step leads to the assembly of the complex and the cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1β by caspase-1 into their mature forms, allowing their release. Here we show that human monocytes, but not monocyte derived macrophages, are able to form canonical NLRP3 inflammasomes in the absence of priming. NLRP3 activator nigericin caused the processing and release of constitutively expressed IL-18 in an unprimed setting. This was mediated by the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome that was dependent on K+ and Cl− efflux and led to ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 and Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) cleavage. IL-18 release was impaired by the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 and by the absence of NLRP3, but also by deficiency of GSDMD, suggesting that pyroptosis is the mechanism of release. This work highlights the readiness of the NLRP3 inflammasome to assemble in the absence of priming in human monocytes and hence contribute to the very early stages of the inflammatory response when IL-1β has not yet been produced. It is important to consider the unprimed setting when researching the mechanisms of NLRP3 activation, as to not overshadow the pathways that occur in the absence of priming stimuli, which might only enhance this response.",GSDMD | IL-18 | inflammasome | macrophage | monocytes | NLRP3 | priming,10,1,WT,110091,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0,2020-09-01

Furthermore, most sepsis-related deaths are among patients whose NLRP3 activation is profoundly altered. In monocytes from sepsis patients, the P2X7 receptor is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, activation of the P2X7 receptor results in mitochondrial damage, which in turn inhibits NLRP3 activation by HIF-1α. We show that mortality increases in a mouse model of sepsis when the P2X7 receptor is activated in vivo.

However, how caspase-1 mediates cytokine release independently of gasdermin D remains poorly understood. Here we show that following caspase-1 activation by different inflammasomes, caspase-1 cleaves early endosome autoantigen 1 (EEA1) protein at Asp127/132. Caspase-1 activation also results in the release of the endosomal EEA1 protein in a gasdermin D-independent manner. EEA1 knock-down results in adecreased release of caspase-1 and IL-1β, but the pyroptotic release of other inflammasome components and lactate dehydrogenase was not affected.

Chemical inhibition of USP7 and USP47 blocks inflammasome formation, independently of transcription, by preventing ASC oligomerisation and speck formation. We also provide evidence that the ubiquitination status of NLRP3 itself is altered by inhibition of USP7 and USP47. Interestingly, we found that the activity of USP7 and USP47 increased in response to inflammasome activators. Using CRISPR/Cas9 in the macrophage cell line THP-1, we show that inflammasome activation is reduced when both USP7 and USP47 are knocked down. Altogether, these data reveal a new post-transcriptional role for USP47 and USP7 in inflammation by regulating inflammasome activation and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and implicate dual USP7 and USP47 inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory disease.",deubiquitination | inflammasome | macrophages | USP47 | USP7,55,1,GSK,MR/N029992/1,AstraZeneca,papers by authors,1,2018-10-01

Following melittin treatment, the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, an adaptor protein with a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), was necessary to activate caspase-1 and induce IL-1β release. However, cell death induced by melittin prevented the formation of large ASC aggregates, amplification of caspase-1 activation, IL-18 release and execution of pyroptosis. Therefore, melittin-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in an attenuated inflammasome response that does not result in caspase-1 dependent cell death.",,20,1,FP7,614578,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,0,2017-08-01

Despite the presence of the CARD domain, Gbp4 requires the universal inflammasome adaptor Asc for mediating its antibacterial function. In addition, the GTPase activity of Gbp4 is indispensable for inflammasome activation and ST clearance. Mechanistically, neutrophils are recruited to the infection site through the inflammasome-independent production of the chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 8 and leukotriene B4, and then mediate bacterial clearance through the Gbp4 inflammasome-dependent biosynthesis of prostaglandin D2.

In response to bacterial infection, ASC also forms specks by self-oligomerization to activate caspase-1 and induce pyroptosis. Hitherto, the role of these specks in NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to danger signals, such as a hypotonic environment, largely has been unexplored. In this article, we report that, under hypotonic conditions and independently of NLRP3, ASC was able to form specks that did not activate caspase-1. These specks were not associated with pyroptosis and were controlled by transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 channel-mediated signaling. However, interaction with NLRP3 enhanced ASC speck formation, leading to fully functional inflammasomes and caspase-1 activation.

However, the response to S. typhimurium in primary human monocytes has not been studied in detail. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of S. typhimurium on inflammasomes in primary human monocytes. Much of the previous research in the field has been conducted in murine models and human THP-1 cells, which may not reflect the responses of primary human monocytes. Here, we report that inhibiting NLRP3 with the selective inhibitor MCC950, blocked release of IL-1β and the related cytokine IL-1α from primary human monocytes in response to S. typhimurium. Additionally, under these conditions S. typhimurium-induced IL-1 release occurred independently of pyroptosis. We propose that IL-1β release without pyroptosis may occur in early-recruited monocytes to regulate a maximal innate immune response to Salmonella infection, allowing a sustained inflammatory signal.

Through a combination of genome-wide RNAi screening approaches and biochemical reconstitution experiments, the basic machinery of FGF2 secretion was identified and validated. This includes the integral membrane protein ATP1A1, the phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and Tec kinase, as well as membrane-proximal heparan sulfate proteoglycans on cell surfaces.

Here, we discuss new developments regarding this process including the mechanism of FGF2 oligomerization during membrane pore formation, the functional role of ATP1A1 in FGF2 secretion, and the possibility that other proteins secreted by unconventional means make use of a similar mechanism to reach the extracellular space.

In moderately thick bilayers (DErPC and DEiPC), it started to tilt and became slightly deformed, and finally it became aggregated in conventional DOPC, POPC, and DMPC membranes due to hydrophobic mismatch. On the other hand, when E5 was co-reconstituted with the transmembrane segment of PDGFR, it was able to tolerate even the most pronounced mismatch and was stabilized by binding to the receptor, which has the same hydrophobic length. As E5 is known to activate PDGFR within the thin membranes of the Golgi compartment, we suggest that the intrinsic hydrophobic mismatch of these two interaction partners drives them together. They seem to recognize each other by forming a closely packed bundle of mutually aligned transmembrane helices, which is further stabilized by a specific pair of hydrogen-bonding residues.",,7,1,NIGMS,P41GM103311,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,papers by authors,0,2015-09-01

Wedetermined the structure of the transmembrane segment in dodecylphosphocholine micelles by liquidstate NMR and found that it forms a stable left-handed helical dimer. Solid-state NMR and oriented circular dichroism were used to measure the tilt angle of the helical segments in macroscopically aligned model membranes with different acyl chain lengths. Both methods showed that decreasing bilayer thickness (DEPC-POPC-DMPC) led to an increase in the helix tilt angle from 10° to 30° with respect to the bilayer normal. At the same time, reconstitution of the comparatively long hydrophobic segment became less effective, eventually resulting in complete protein aggregation in the short-chain lipid DLPC. Unrestrained molecular dynamics simulations of the dimer were carried out in explicit lipid bilayers (DEPC, POPC, DMPC, sphingomyelin), confirming the observed dependence of the helix tilt angle on bilayer thickness. Notably, molecular dynamics revealed that the left-handed dimer gets tilted en bloc, whereas conformational transitions to alternative (e.g. right-handed dimeric) states were not supported. The experimental data along with the simulation results demonstrate a pronounced interplay between the platelet-directed growth factor receptor βtransmembrane segment and the bilayer thickness. The effect of hydrophobic mismatch might play a key role in the redistribution and activation of the receptor within different lipid microdomains of the plasma membrane in vivo. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,52,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2012-07-01

Caspase-1 induces gasdermin D pore formation during pyroptosis, whereas caspase-3 promotes gasdermin E pore formation during apoptosis. These two types of cell death are accompanied by mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization due to BAK/BAX pore formation in the external membrane of mitochondria, and to some extent, this complex also affects the inner mitochondrial membrane facilitating mitochondrial DNA relocalization from the matrix to the cytosol. However, the detailed mechanism responsible for this process has not been investigated. Herein, we reported that gasdermin processing is required to induce mitochondrial DNA release from cells during pyroptosis and apoptosis. Gasdermin targeted at the plasma membrane promotes a fast mitochondrial collapse along with the initial accumulation of mitochondrial DNA in the cytosol and then facilitates the DNA's release from the cell when the plasma membrane ruptures. These findings demonstrate that gasdermin action has a critical effect on the plasma membrane and facilitates the release of mitochondrial DNA as a damage-associated molecular pattern.",GSDMD | GSDME | macrophages | mitochondrial DNA | pyroptosis,0,1,ERC,0003/COVI/20,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,0,2021-08-01

However, tissue injury caused by biomaterial implantation lead to the release of danger signals that engage different inflammatory pathways on the host. Different implanted materials activate the inflammasome leading to the modulation of the immune response. Here we have studied how macroscopic biomaterials, Ch scaffolds with different chemical composition: 4% or 15% degree of acetylation (DA) modulate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro. For that, we assessed the NLRP3 inflammasome in bone marrow derived mouse macrophages (BMDM) and human macrophages cultured within 3D Ch scaffolds. We found that both Ch scaffolds did not trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Furthermore, BMDMs and human macrophages cultured in both Ch scaffolds presented a reduction in the number of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activating recruitment domain (ASC) specks and in IL-1β release upon classical NLRP3 inflammasome stimulation. We also found a decrease in proIL-1β in BMDMs after priming with LPS when cultured in Ch scaffolds with DA 4% DA after priming with LPS when compared to Ch scaffolds with 15% DA or to macrophages cultured in cell-culture plates. Our results shows that 3D Ch scaffolds with different DA impair NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation. Statement of Significance: In this research work we have assessed the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the macrophage response to 3D chitosan scaffolds with different degrees of acetylation (DA). To our knowledge this is the first work that demonstrates the modulatory capacity of 3D porous chitosan scaffolds in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, because our results show that Ch scaffolds impair NLRP3 inflammasome assembly in macrophages. Interestingly, our results are in contrast with studies reported in the literature that indicate that chitosan is a powerful activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome in nanoscale chitosan products. Our studies that were performed in large scale chitosan scaffolds, stress out that the process of phagocytosis is pivotal in inflammasome assembly and activation, are rather important since they clearly illustrate the different role of the inflammasome in the biological response to large scale and nanoscale biomaterials.",3D scaffolds | ASC | Biomaterials | Immunomodulation | Inflammasomes | Interleukin-1 | Macrophages,12,0,FCT,PD/00016/2012,Fuel Cycle Technologies,papers by authors,0,2019-06-01

TNF-α release is controlled by the activity of TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) that cut membrane-bound TNF-α to shed its ectodomain as a soluble cytokine. The purinergic receptor P2X ligand-gated ion channel 7 (P2X7) is activated in response to elevated concentrations of extracellular ATP and induces different pro-inflammatory pathways in macrophages to establish an inflammatory response. P2X7 receptor promotes the activation of the inflammasome and the release of interleukin-1β, the production of inflammatory lipids, and the generation of reactive oxygen species. In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of P2X7 receptor responsible of TNF-α release after priming macrophages with LPS doses≤100 ng/ml. We found that P2X7 receptor increases the extracellular activity of TACE through the release of the mature form of TACE in exosomes. This effect was blocked using P2X7 receptor inhibitors or in macrophages obtained from P2X7 receptor-deficient mice. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase after P2X7 receptor activation were involved in the release of TACE, which was able to process TNF-α on nearby expressing cells. Finally, we observed an increase of TNF-α in the peritoneal lavage of mice treated with LPS and ATP. In conclusion, P2X7 receptor induces the release of TACE in exosomes to the extracellular compartment that could amplify the pro-inflammatory signal associated to this receptor.

Here, we report that, from fish to mammals, the basic mechanisms of cell swelling and regulatory volume decrease (RVD) are sensed via the NLRP3 inflammasome. We found that a decrease in extracellular osmolarity induced a K+-dependent conformational change of the preassembled NLRP3-inactive inflammasome during cell swelling, followed by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, which was controlled by transient receptor potential channels during RVD. Both mechanisms were necessary for interleukin-1β processing. Increased extracellular osmolarity prevented caspase-1 activation by different known NLRP3 activators. Collectively, our data identify cell volume regulation as a basic conserved homeostatic mechanism associated with the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and reveal a mechanism for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,231,1,WT,11922/PI/09,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,0,2012-09-01

Methods: The study was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology and the guidelines for performing systematic literature reviews in bioinformatics (BiSLR). The PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were searched for publications through April 2020. Proteomics studies designed to understand liver transplant outcomes, including ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), rejection, or operational tolerance in human or rat samples that applied methodologies for differential expression analysis were considered. Results: The analysis included 22 studies after application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among the 497 proteins annotated, 68 were shared between species and 10 were shared between sample sources. Among the types of studies analyzed, IRI and rejection shared a higher number of proteins. The most enriched pathway for liver biopsy samples, IRI, and rejection was metabolism, compared to cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions for tolerance. Conclusions: Proteomics is a promising technique to detect large numbers of proteins. However, our study shows that several technical issues such as the identification of proteoforms or the dynamic range of protein concentration in clinical samples hinder the successful identification of biomarkers in liver transplantation. In addition, there is a need to minimize the experimental variability between studies, increase the sample size and remove high-abundance plasma proteins.",ischemia – reperfusion | mass spectrometry | PRISMA | rejection | tolerance,0,1,ISCIII,AP171362019,Fundación Mutua Madrileña,papers by authors,0,2021-07-01

Until now, there have been no general recommendations on how humanitarian surgical missions should be organized. Methods: Based on our experience in the field of humanitarian surgical missions to Sub-Saharan Africa, a panel of recommendations in times of COVID-19 was developed. The fields under study were as follows: (1) Planning of a multidisciplinary project; (2) Organization of the infrastructure; (3) Screening, management and treatment of SARS-COV-2; (4) Diagnostic tests for SARS-COV-2; (5) Surgical priorization and (6) Context of patients during health-care assistance. We applied a risk bias measurement to obtain a consensus among humanitarian health-care providers with experience in this field. Results: A total of 94.36% of agreement were reached for the approval of the recommendations. Emergency surgery must be a priority, and elective surgery adapted. For emergency surgery, we established a priority level 1a (< 24 h) and 1b (< 72 h). For an elective procedure, according our American College of Surgeon adaptation score, process with more than 60 points should be reconsidered. Due to the low life expectancy in many African countries, we consider 45–50 years as age of risk. In case of SARS-COV-2 active infection or high clinical suspicion, the screening, management and treatment should be following the international guidelines adapted to duration of the stay, available infrastructure, size of the cooperation team and medical resources. Conclusions: Humanitarian surgical mission in times of COVID-19 is a challenge that must extrapolate the established recommendations to the local cooperation environment.",,1,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2021-05-01

In particular, the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing (NLR) family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a complex platform involved in the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, which are mainly released via pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a caspase-1-dependent type of cell death that is mediated by the cleavage of gasdermin D and the subsequent formation of structurally stable pores in the cell membrane. Through these pores formed by gasdermin proteins cytosolic contents are released into the extracellular space and act as damage-associated molecular patterns, which are pro-inflammatory signals. Inflammation is a main contributor to the development of hypertension and it also is known to stimulate fibrosis and end-organ damage. Patients with essential hypertension and animal models of hypertension exhibit elevated levels of circulating IL-1β. Down-regulation of the expression of key components of the NLRP3 inflammasome delays the development of hypertension and pharmacological inhibition of this inflammasome leads to reduced blood pressure in animal models and humans. Although the relationship between pyroptosis and hypertension is not well established yet, pyroptosis has been associated with renal and cardiovascular diseases, instances where high blood pressure is a critical risk factor. In this review, we summarize the recent literature addressing the role of pyroptosis and the inflammasome in the development of hypertension and discuss the potential use of approaches targeting this pathway as future anti-hypertensive strategies.",Hypertension | Inflammasome | Inflammation | Pyroptosis,2,1,NIH,899636,Fundación Mutua Madrileña,papers by authors,0,2021-02-01

Moreover, different groups have defined several biomarkers, trying to distinguish patients who are going to be tolerant from those who are going to reject. However, most of these biomarkers have not been validated by other groups or even established for clinical practice. METHODS: We reanalyzed and stratified the predictive capacity of 20 previously described biomarkers for liver transplantation tolerance in a cohort of 17 liver transplant patients subjected to an independent, nonrandomized, prospective study of immunosuppression drug withdrawal. RESULTS: Only 4 of the 20 studied biomarkers (expression of SENP6, FEM1C, miR31, and miR95) showed a strong predictive capacity in the present study. miR31 and FEM1C presented an area under the ROC curve of 96.7%, followed by SENP1 with 93.3%. Finally, miR95 had an area under the ROC curve value <86.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Even though this independent analysis seems to confirm the predictive strength of SENP6 and FEM1C in liver transplantation tolerance, there are also risks in establishing biomarkers for clinical phenotypes without an understanding of how they are biologically relevant. Future collaborations between groups should be promoted so that the most promising biomarkers can be validated and implemented in daily clinical practice.",,4,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2019-09-01

In healthy mammals, CLs are unsaturated, whereas saturated CLs are found in blood cells from Barth syndrome patients and in some Gram-positive bacteria. Here, we show that unsaturated but not saturated CLs block LPS-induced NF-κB activation, TNF-α and IP-10 secretion in human and murine macrophages, as well as LPS-induced TNF-α and IL-1β release in human blood mononuclear cells. Using HEK293 cells transfected with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its co-receptor Myeloid Differentiation 2 (MD2), we demonstrate that unsaturated CLs compete with LPS for binding TLR4/MD2 preventing its activation, whereas saturated CLs are TLR4/MD2 agonists. As a consequence, saturated CLs induce a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages characterized by TNF-α and IP-10 secretion, and activate the alternative NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in human blood-derived monocytes. Thus, we identify that double bonds discriminate between anti- and pro-inflammatory properties of tetra-acylated molecules, providing a rationale for the development of TLR4 activators and inhibitors for use as vaccine adjuvants or in the treatment of TLR4-related diseases.

The action of extracellular nucleotides in human T cells was analyzed by in vitro experiments with isolated T cells. Additionally, 17 liver transplant patients were enrolled in an immunosuppression withdrawal trial, and the differences in the CD39-CD73-A 2 R axis were compared between tolerant and nontolerant patients. In contrast to the mice, the activation of human Tregs was inhibited similarly to Teffs in the presence of eADO. Moreover, the expression of the enzyme responsible for the degradation of ADO, adenosine deaminase, was higher in tolerant patients with respect to the nontolerant group along the immunosuppression withdrawal.

We find that host immune cells release ATP as an inflammatory signal in response to allogeneic transplantation. ATP then acts via a feedback mechanism on the P2X7 channel to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequently process and release interleukin (IL)-18. This process is a necessary stage in the deleterious Th1 response against allotransplantation via interferon-γ production. Lack of IL-18 resulted in a decrease in graft-infiltrating CD8 cells but an increase in regulatory T cells. In human liver transplant patients undergoing progressive immunosuppressive drug withdrawal, we found that patients experiencing acute rejection had higher levels of the P2X7 receptor in circulating inflammatory monocytes compared to tolerant patients. These data suggest that the pharmacological inhibition of the P2X7 receptor or the NLRP3 inflammasome will aid in inducing transplant tolerance without complete immunoparalysis.

Recently, somatic NLRP3 mosaicism has been reported in some CAPS patients who were previously classified as ""mutation-negative."" We describe here the clinical and laboratory findings in eight British adult patients who presented with symptoms typical of CAPS other than an onset in mid-late adulthood. All patients underwent comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigations, including analysis of the NLRP3 gene using Sanger and amplicon-based deep sequencing (ADS) along with measurements of extracellular apoptosis-associated speck-like protein with CARD domain (ASC) aggregates. The clinical phenotype in all subjects was consistent with mid-spectrum CAPS, except a median age at disease onset of 50 years. Sanger sequencing of NLRP3 was non-diagnostic but ADS detected a somatic NLRP3 mutation in each case. In one patient, DNA isolated from blood demonstrated an increase in the mutant allele from 5 to 45% over 12 years. ASC aggregates in patients' serum measured during active disease were significantly higher than healthy controls. This series represents 8% of CAPS patients diagnosed in a single center, suggesting that acquired NLRP3 mutations may not be an uncommon cause of the syndrome and should be sought in all patients with late-onset symptoms otherwise compatible with CAPS.

Thus, we analyzed the implication of different peripheral blood Treg subsets and miRNAs on LT tolerance in 24 tolerant (Tol) and 23 non-tolerant (non-Tol) LT recipients by cellular, genetic, and epigenetic approximation. Non-Tol patients had a lower demethylation rate of the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) regulatory T cell–specific demethylated region (TSDR) than Tol patients that correlated with the frequency of circulating Tregs. Tol patients presented a different signature of Treg subset markers compared with non-Tol patients with increased expression of HELIOS and FOXP3 and a higher proportion of latency-associated peptide (LAP)+ Tregs and CD45RA– human leukocyte antigen D related (HLA-DR)+ activated effector-memory Tregs. The expression of miR95, miR24, miR31, miR146a, and miR155 was higher in Tol than in non-Tol patients and was positively correlated with activated Treg markers. In conclusion, these data suggest that activated effector-memory Tregs and a TSDR-demethylation state of Tregs may play a role in the complex system of regulation of LT tolerance.

However, data are scarce regarding immunosuppression minimization in clinical practice. Material/Methods: In this cross-sectional, multicenter study, we reviewed the indications of immunosuppression minimization (de-fined as tacrolimus levels below 5 ng/mL or cyclosporine levels below 50 ng/mL) among 661 liver transplant recipients, as well as associated factors and the effect on renal function. Results: Fifty-three percent of the patients received minimized immunosuppression. The median time from transplantation to minimization was 32 months. The most frequent indications were renal insufficiency (49%), cardiovascular risk (19%), de novo malignancy (8%), and cardiovascular disease (7%). The factors associated with minimization were older age at transplantation, longer post-transplant follow-up, pre-transplant diabetes mellitus and renal dysfunction, and the hospital where the patients were being followed. The patients who were minimized because of renal insufficiency had a significant improvement in renal function (decrease of the median serum creatinine level, from 1.50 to 1.34 mg/dL; P=0.004). Renal function significantly improved in patients minimized for other indications, too. In the long term, glomerular filtration rate significantly decreased in non-minimized patients and remained stable in minimized patients. Conclusions: Immunosuppression minimization is frequently undertaken in long-term liver transplant recipients, mainly for renal insufficiency. Substantial variability exists regarding the use of IS minimization among centers.",Drug-related side effects and adverse reactions | Liver transplantation | Transplantation tolerance,3,0,ISCIII,undefined,Instituto de Salud Carlos III,papers by authors,0,2017-01-01

This study was undertaken to characterize the genetic cause underlying late-onset but otherwise typical CAPS. Methods: We studied a 64-year-old patient who presented with recurrent episodes of urticaria-like rash, fever, conjunctivitis, and oligoarthritis at age 56 years. DNA was extracted from both unfractionated blood and isolated leukocyte and CD34+ subpopulations. Genetic studies were performed using both the Sanger method of DNA sequencing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. In vitro and ex vivo analyses were performed to determine the consequences that the presence of the variant have in the normal structure or function of the protein of the detected variant. Results: NGS analyses revealed the novel p.Gln636Glu NLRP3 variant in unfractionated blood, with an allele frequency (18.4%) compatible with gene mosaicism. Sanger sequence chromatograms revealed a small peak corresponding to the variant allele. Amplicon-based deep sequencing revealed somatic NLRP3 mosaicism restricted to myeloid cells (31.8% in monocytes, 24.6% in neutrophils, and 11.2% in circulating CD34+ common myeloid progenitor cells) and its complete absence in lymphoid cells. Functional analyses confirmed the gain-of-function behavior of the gene variant and hyperactivity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the patient. Treatment with anakinra resulted in good control of the disease. Conclusion: We identified the novel gain-of-function p.Gln636Glu NLRP3 mutation, which was detected as a somatic mutation restricted to myeloid cells, as the cause of late-onset but otherwise typical CAPS.

However, immunosuppression poorly influences chronic rejection and elicits chronic toxicity in current clinical practice. Thus, a major goal in transplantation is to understand and induce tolerance. It is well established that human regulatory T cells expressing the transcription factor FoxP3 play important roles in the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. The major regulatory T cell subsets and mechanisms of expansion that are critical for induction and long-term maintenance of graft tolerance and survival are being actively investigated. Likewise, other immune cells, such as dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages or natural killer cells, have been described as part of the process known as operational tolerance. However, translation of these results towards clinical practice needs solid tools to identify accurately and reliably patients who are going to be tolerant. In this way, a plethora of genetic and cellular biomarkers is raising and being validated worldwide in large multicenter clinical trials. Few of the studies performed so far have provided a detailed analysis of the impact of immunosuppression withdrawal on pre-existing complications derived from the long-term administration of immunosuppressive drugs and the side effects associated with them. The future of liver transplantation is aimed to develop new therapies which increase the actual low tolerant vs non-tolerant recipients ratio.",Biomarkers | Dendritic cells | Liver transplantation | Operational tolerance | Regulatory T cells,16,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2016-09-01

We found that extracellular nucleotides arrest macrophage differentiation from bone marrow precursors via adenosine and P2 receptors. This results in a mature macrophage with increased expression of M2, but not M1, genes. Similar to adenosine and ATP, macrophage growth arrested with LPS treatment resulted in an increase of the M2-related marker Ym1.

However, the reason of such hypertrophy is still unclear, but it is suggested that liver transection combined with portal vein ligation (ALPPS) during the first stage of this technique may play a key role. The aim of this study is to compare the hypertrophic stimulus on the FLR and the clinical changes associated with both ALPPS and PVL in a rat surgical model. For this purpose, three groups of SD rats were used, namely ALPPS (n = 30), PVL (n = 30) and sham-treated (n = 30). The second stage of ALPPS (hepatectomy of the atrophic lobes), was performed at day 8. Blood and FLR samples were collected at 1, 24, 48 hours, 8 days and 12 weeks after the surgeries. ALPPS provoked a greater degree of hypertrophy of the FLR than the PVL at 48 hours and 8 days (p<0.05). The molecular pattern was also different, with the highest expression of IL-1β at 24h, IL-6 at 8 days, and HGF and TNF-α at 48 hours and 8 days (p<0.05). ALPPS also brought about a mild proliferative stimulus at 12 weeks, with a higher expression of HGF and TGF-β (p<0.05) than PVL. Clinically, ALPPS caused a significant liver damage during the first 48 hours, with a recovery of liver function at day 8. In conclusion, ALPPS seems to induce higher functional hypertrophy on the FLR than PVL at day 8. Such regenerative response seems to be leaded by a complex interaction between promitogenic (IL-6, HGF, TNF-α) and antiproliferative (IL1-β and TGF-β) cytokines.",,27,1,,FFIS/CM10/002,Fundación Cajamurcia,papers by authors,0,2015-12-01

It has been shown that more than 10% of transplanted individuals suffer relapse during the first year after surgery and most of them die because of the tumor. The circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are the main source of recurrences as they disseminate from a primary or metastatic tumor lesion through peripheral blood. We aimed to determine the concentration of CTCs in peripheral blood in these patients by 2 different approaches: the CellSearch and the IsoFlux systems to assess their applicability to this disease monitoring. Patients and Methods A comparative study was conducted in 21 patients with HCC eligible for liver transplantation according to the Milan criteria, whose peripheral blood was processed by the CellSearch and the IsoFlux systems. Results CTCs were isolated in 1 of the 21 patients (4.7%) by the CellSearch system and in 19 of the 21 patients (90.5%) by the IsoFlux method. The comparison of both methods using Bland-Altman plot shows that there is not consistency in the determination of CTCs in our patients, finding a proportional bias between them. Conclusion The results obtained by both CTCs isolation systems are not interchangeable nor transferable. The CellSearch system does not seem to be the ideal approach for studying CTCs in patients with HCC. The IsoFlux system displays greater sensitivity in the identification of CTCs and might become an important tool in patient management.",,16,0,ISCIII,19447/PI/14,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,1,2015-11-01

We investigate the role of corticotropin releasing factor receptor type one (CRF1R) and the different response of male and female mice in the expression and extinction of the aversive memory. Methodology/Principal Finding We used genetically engineered male and female mice lacking functional CRF1R. The animals were rendered dependent on morphine by intraperitoneally injection of increasing doses of morphine (10-60 mg/kg). Negative state associated with naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.)-precipitated morphine withdrawal was examined by using conditioned place aversion (CPA) paradigm. No sex differences for CPA expression were found in wild-type (n = 29) or CRF1R knockout (KO) mice (n = 29). However, CRF1R KO mice presented less aversion score than wild-type mice, suggesting that CRF1R KO mice were less responsive than wildtype to continuous associations between drug administration and environmental stimuli. In addition, CPA extinction was delayed in wild-type and CRF1R KO male mice compared with females of both genotypes. The genetic disruption of the CRF1R pathway decreased the period of extinction in males and females suggesting that CRF/CRF1R is implicated in the duration of aversive memory. Our results also showed that the increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels observed in wild-type (n = 11) mice after CPA expression, were attenuated in CRF1R KO mice (n = 10). In addition, ACTH returned to the baseline levels in males and females once CPA extinction was finished. Conclusion/Significance These results suggest that, at least, CPA expression is partially due to an increase in plasma ACTH levels, through activation of CRF1R, which can return when CPA extinction is finished.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) pathways are important mediators in the negative symptoms of opioid withdrawal. We performed a series of experiments to characterize the role of the CRF 1 receptor in the response of stress systems to morphine withdrawal and its effect in the heart using genetically engineered mice lacking functional CRF1 receptors. Experimental Approach Wild-type and CRF1 receptor-knockout mice were treated with increasing doses of morphine. Precipitated withdrawal was induced by naloxone. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone levels, the expression of myocardial Hsp27, Hsp27 phosphorylated at Ser82, membrane (MB)- COMT, soluble (S)-COMT protein and NA turnover were evaluated by RIA, immunoblotting and HPLC. Key Results During morphine withdrawal we observed an enhancement of NA turnover in parallel with an increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in wild-type mice. In addition, naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal induced an activation of HPA axis and Hsp27. The principal finding of the present study was that plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels, MB-COMT, S-COMT, NA turnover, and Hsp27 expression and activation observed during morphine withdrawal were significantly inhibited in the CRF1 receptor-knockout mice. Conclusion and Implications Our results demonstrate that CRF/CRF 1 receptor activation may contribute to stress-induced cardiovascular dysfunction after naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal and suggest that CRF/CRF1 receptor pathways could contribute to cardiovascular disease associated with opioid addiction. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.",CRF  receptor knockout mice 1 | heart | Hsp 27 | NA turnover | naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal,13,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2014-02-01

P2X7R activates the inflammasome and the release of IL-1β in macrophages and other immune cells to initiate the inflammatory response. Here we show that P2X7R stimulation by ATP in APCs decreased the amount of MHC I at the plasma membrane.

Hemichannels open in response to a wide range of stressful conditions, such as ischemia, pressure or swelling. Hemichannels represent an important mechanism for the cellular release of adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), which is an agonist of the P2Y and P2X family of purinergic receptors. Therefore, hemichannels are key molecules in the regulation of purinergic receptor activation, during physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Furthermore, purinergic receptor activation can also lead to the opening of hemichannels and the subsequent amplification of purinergic signaling via a positive signaling feedback loop, giving rise to the concept of ATP-induced ATP release. Purinergic receptor signaling is involved in regulating many physiological and pathophysiological processes. P2Y receptors activate inositol trisphosphate and transiently increase intracellular calcium. This signaling opens both connexin and pannexin channels, therefore contributing to the expansion of calcium waves across astrocytes and epithelial cells. In addition, several of the P2X receptor subtypes, including the P2X2, P2X4 and P2X7 receptors, activate select cellular permeation pathways to large molecules, including the pannexin-1 channels, which are involved in the initiation of inflammatory responses and cell death. Consequently, the interplay between purinergic receptors and hemichannels could represent a novel target with substantial therapeutic implications in areas such as chronic pain, inflammation or atherosclerosis.

However, a failure to control immune response results in chronic inflammation and several associated disorders such as pain and loss of function. Initiation of inflammation is orchestrated by cytokines, among which IL-1β is particularly important. IL-1β is synthesized as an inactive protein that has to be processed by the inflammasome to generate the mature bioactive form. Conventional techniques cannot monitor IL-1β activation with high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we present a ratiometric biosensor that allows monitoring IL-1β processing in real time, with a temporal resolution of seconds and with a single-cell spatial resolution. Using this sensor, to our knowledge, we describe for the first time the kinetic of the inflammasome activity in living macrophages.With this new probe, we also demonstrated that the pro-IL-1β processing occurs all over the cytoplasm.

Objectives We used genetically engineered mice lacking functional CRF receptor-1 (CRF1R) levels to study the role for CRF/CRF1R pathways in the negative affective states of opioid withdrawal. Methods Wild-type and CRF1R -/- offspring of CRF1R +/-breeders were identified by PCR analysis of tail DNA and were rendered dependent on morphine via intraperitoneal injection of increasing doses of morphine (10-60 mg/kg). Negative state associated with opioid withdrawal was examined by using conditioned place aversion (CPA), TH expression and TH phosphorylation were measured in different brain regions involved in addictive behaviours using immunohistochemistry. Results The weight loss in morphine withdrawn CRF1R -/animals was significantly (p<0.05) lower versus wild-type. The aversion for environmental cues paired with opioid withdrawal was lower (p<0.001) in the CRF1R-deficient versus wild-type. Using dual immunolabeling for c-Fos, data show that naloxone-induced withdrawal increases the number of TH positive neurons phosphorylated at Ser40 or Ser31 that coexpress c-Fos in the nucleus of tractus solitarius (NTS)-A2 from wild-type and CRF -/- deficient mice. By contrast, the number of phospho-Ser40 or phospho-Ser31 positive neurons expressing c-Fos was lower in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM)-A1 in CRF -/--deficient mice. Conclusion Our study demonstrates an increased activity of brainstem catecholaminergic neurons after CPA induced by morphine withdrawal suggesting that CRF1R is implicated in the activation of A1 neurons and provides evidence that this receptor is involved in the body weight loss and in the negative aversive effects of morphine withdrawal. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Aversion | CRF1R-deficient mice | Naloxone-induced withdrawal | Phospho-Ser31TH | Phospho-Ser40TH | Total TH,15,0,MICINN,.15519/FPI/10,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,0,2012-03-01

Materials and methods: Our study was carried out on a population of 21,855 asymptomatic women (45-65 years). Mammograms were processed in a CAD system and independently interpreted by one of six radiologists. We analyzed the following parameters: sensitivity of radiologist's interpretation (without and with CAD), detection increase, recall rate and positive predictive value of biopsy, CAD's marks, radiologist's false negatives and comparative analysis of carcinomas detected and non-detected by CAD. Results: Detection rate was 4.3‰. CAD supposed an increase of 0.1‰ in detection rate and 1% in the total number of cases (p < 0.005). The impact on recall rate was not significant (0.4%) and PPV of percutaneous biopsy was unchanged by CAD (20.23%). CAD's marks were 2.7 per case and 0.7 per view. Radiologist's false negatives were 13 lesions which were initially considered as CAD's false positives. Conclusions: CAD supposed a significant increase in detection, without modifications in recall rates and PPV of biopsy. However, better results could have been achieved if radiologists had considered actionable those cases marked by CAD but initially misinterpreted. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Novel M2-associated markers were characterized and identified as genes controlling the extracellular metabolism of ATP to generate pyrophosphates (PPi). Stimulation of M1 macrophages with PPi dampens both NLR and TLR signaling and thus mediates cytokine production. In this context extracellular PPi enhanced the resolution phase of a murine peritonitis model via a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

More recently, P2X7 R have been described as potential cancer cell biomarkers. However, mechanistic links between P2X7 R and cancer cell processes are unknown. Here, we show, in the highly aggressive human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435s, that P2X 7 receptor is highly expressed and fully functional. Its activation is responsible for the extension of neurite-like cellular prolongations, of the increase in cell migration by 35% and in cell invasion through extracellular matrix by 150%. The change in cancer cell morphology and the increased migration appeared to be due to the activation of Ca 2-activated SK3 potassium channels. The enhanced invasion through the extracellular matrix was related to the increase of mature forms of cysteine cathepsins in the extracellular medium, which was independent of SK3 channel activity and not associated with cell death. Pharmacological targeting of P2X7 R in vivo was crucial for cell invasiveness in a zebrafish model of metastases. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanistic link between P2X7 R functionality in cancer cells and invasiveness, a key parameter in tumour growth and in the development of metastases.

In clinical transplantation there is increasing evidence that some liver transplant recipients who cease taking immunosuppressive (IS) drugs maintain allograft function, suggesting that tolerance is already present. This strategy is feasible in 25-33% of liver transplant recipients. A series of experimental and clinical observations indicates that liver allografts can even provide ""tolerogenic"" properties for other organ grafts. In the clinical setting, clinical operational tolerance (COT) is defined as the absence of acute and chronic rejection and graft survival with normal function and histology in an IS-free, fully immunocompetent host, usually as an end result of a successful attempt at IS withdrawal. The exact mechanisms involved in achieving transplant tolerance remain unknown, although animal models suggest a possible role for regulatory T cells (Treg). Recent data have demonstrated an increase in the frequency of CD4+ CD25high T cells and FoxP3 transcripts during IS withdrawal in operationally tolerant liver transplant recipients. The data obtained from transcriptional profiling of the peripheral blood of IS-free liver transplant recipients suggest that there is a molecular signature of tolerance that could be employed to identify tolerant liver transplant recipients and that innate immune cells are likely to play a major role in the maintenance of COT after liver transplantation. © 2010 Elsevier España, S.L.",Immunosuppression withdrawal | Liver transplantation | Operational tolerance | Regulatory T cells,10,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2011-03-01

P2X7Rs show several unusual biophysical properties, in particular marked facilitation of currents and leftward shift in agonist affinity in response to repeated or prolonged agonist applications. We previously found the facilitation at rat P2X 7R resulted from a Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent process and a distinct calcium-independent process. However, P2X7Rs show striking species differences; thus, this study compared the properties of ATP-evoked facilitation of currents in HEK293 cells transiently expressing the human or rat P2X7R as well as rat/human, human/rat chimeric, and mutated P2X 7Rs. Facilitation at the human P2X7R was 5-fold slower than at the rat P2X7R. Facilitation did not resulting from an increase of receptor addressing the plasma membrane. We found the human P2X 7R shows only calcium-independent facilitation with no evidence for calmodulin-dependent processes, nor does it contain the novel 1-5-16 calmodulin binding domain present in the C terminus of rat P2X7R. Replacement of three critical residues of this binding domain from the rat into the human P2X7R (T541I, C552S, and G559V) reconstituted the Ca 2+-calmodulin-dependent facilitation, leaving the calcium-independent facilitation unaltered. The leftward shift in the ATP concentration-response curve with repeated agonist applications appears to be a property of the calcium-independent facilitation process because it was not altered in any of the chimeric or mutated P2X7Rs. The absence of Ca2+- dependent facilitation at the human P2X7R may represent a protective adaptation of the innate immune response in which P2X7R plays significant roles. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,48,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2010-06-01

Parp-2 deficiency in mice (Parp-2-/-) results in reduced thymic cellularity associated with increased apoptosis in thymocytes, defining Parp-2 as an important mediator of T-cell survival during thymopoiesis. To determine whether there is a link between Parp-2 and the p53 DNA-damage-dependent apoptotic response, we have generated Parp-2/p53-double-null mutant mice. We found that p53-/- backgrounds completely restored the survival and development of Parp-2 -/- thymocytes. However, Parp-2-deficient thymocytes accumulated high levels of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), independently of the p53 status, in line with a function of Parp-2 as a caretaker promoting genomic stability during thymocytes development. Although Parp-2-/- mice do not have spontaneous tumours, Parp-2 deficiency accelerated spontaneous tumour development in p53-null mice, mainly T-cell lymphomas. These data suggest a synergistic interaction between Parp-2 and p53 in tumour suppression through the role of Parp-2 in DNA-damage response and genome integrity surveillance, and point to the potential importance of examining human tumours for the status of both genes. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Double-strand breaks | P53 | Parp-2 | Thymocytes | Tumour development | V(D)J recombination,38,1,ARC,2009/SGR/524,Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer,papers by authors,0,2010-05-01

Liver biochemical tests, blood pressure, serum creatinine, serum urea, serum uric acid, triglycerides, cholesterol and glucose were monitored after the start of weaning. Eight of the 20 patients (40%) were IS therapy free for a mean period of 61 ± 39 months (range: 10-132 months). Of the remaining 12 patients, mild or moderate acute rejection occurred in six patients (30%), and mixed inflammatory portal tract infiltrate was seen in another six patients (30%). At the end of the study, mean (SD) serum creatinine had fallen by 0.28 (0.10)mg/dL (p < 0.001) in operationally tolerant (T) patients whereas the serum creatinine level increased in IS-dependent patients [+0.35 (0.35) mg/dL] (p = 0.005). In T patients, serum cholesterol, serum uric acid, fasting glucose and diastolic arterial pressure values significantly decreased.

Preliminary clinical data have suggested an increase in the frequency of regulatory T cells (Treg) CD4+CD25 and FoxP3 expression in operationally tolerant liver transplant recipients (Gr-T). In the context of human liver transplantation, the dynamics of Treg have not been studied. We designed a prospective study to ascertain the profile of the Treg population and FoxP3 expression during IS withdrawal. METHODS.: To identify such parameters, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cell populations and FoxP3 mRNA expression in 12 liver allograft recipients under cyclosporine A-based IS, who showed stable function of the allograft for more than 2 years. RESULTS.: An increase was observed in the frequency of CD4+CD25 cells when the IS was withdrawn in Gr-T patients (n=5). These patients exhibited a 3.5-fold increase for relative mRNA FoxP3 expression before the complete IS withdrawal and this continued when IS therapy was stopped. In patients who suffered rejection (n=7) there was no increase in the CD4+CD25 cells or FoxP3 expression. CONCLUSIONS.: With the present study, the first evidence is provided that the increase of CD4+CD25 T cells and FoxP3 transcripts is associated with operational tolerance in liver transplanted patients during IS withdrawal. © 2008 by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.",FoxP3 | Immunosuppression withdrawal | Liver transplantation | Operational tolerance | Treg,134,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2008-11-01

PARP-1 might modulate gene expression through its catalytic activity leading to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins or by its physical association with relevant proteins. Recently, we have shown that PARP-1 is activated during T cell activation. However, the proposed role of PARP-1 in reprogramming T cell gene expression upon activation remains largely unexplored. Results: In the present study we use oligonucleotide microarray analysis to gain more insight into the role played by PARP-1 during the gene expression reprogramming that takes place in T cells upon activation with anti-CD3 stimulation alone, or in combination with anti-CD28 co-stimulation. We have identified several groups of genes with expression modulated by PARP-1. The expression of 129 early-response genes to anti-CD3 seems to be regulated by PARP-1 either in a positive (45 genes) or in a negative manner (84 genes). Likewise, in the presence of co-stimulation (anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation), the expression of 203 genes is also regulated by PARP-1 either up (173 genes) or down (30 genes). Interestingly, PARP-1 deficiency significantly alters expression of genes associated with the immune response such as chemokines and genes involved in the Th1/Th2 balance. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into changes in gene expression mediated by PARP-1 upon T cell activation. Pathway analysis of PARP-1 as a nuclear signalling molecule in T cells would be of relevance for the future development of new therapeutic approaches targeting PARP-1 in the acquired immune response. © 2008 Saenz et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,36,1,ISCIII,BIO-2005-01393,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,0,2008-04-01

Thermal inactivation of ACS1 was biphasic, while that of ACS2 was monophasic. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from the inactivation profiles show ACS2 to be a more thermostable enzyme than ACS1. The presence of ATP and Mg 2+ exerted a protective effect on both enzymes, and led to a marked increase in the Ea, ΔH≠, ΔS≠ and ΔG≠ values. ACS2 is also much more stable against denaturation with urea; the estimates of ΔGw (free energy change for protein unfolding at zero denaturant concentration) were 9.4 kJ mol-1 and 18.1 kJ mol-1 for ACS1 and ACS2, respectively. Finally, a half-life of 44.5 min for ACS2 versus the 21 min for ACS1 indicates that ACS2 is more stable than ACS1 against digestion by trypsin.

Heat Shock (HS) affects the signalling and gene expression responses of the Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factor, a critical regulator of proliferation and inflammation, however, our quantitative understanding of how cells sense and adapt to temperature changes is limited. Methods: We used live-cell time-lapse microscopy and mathematical modelling to understand the signalling of the NF-κB system in the human MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells in response to pro-inflammatory Interleukin 1β (IL1β) and Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) cytokines, following exposure to a 37-43 °C range of physiological and clinical temperatures. Results: We show that exposure to 43 °C 1 h HS inhibits the immediate NF-κB signalling response to TNFα and IL1β stimulation although uptake of cytokines is not impaired. Within 4 h after HS treatment IL1β-induced NF-κB responses return to normal levels, but the recovery of the TNFα-induced responses is still affected. Using siRNA knock-down of Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) we show that this stimulus-specificity is conferred via the Inhibitory κB kinase (IKK) signalosome where HSF1-dependent feedback regulates TNFα, but not IL1β-mediated IKK recovery post HS. Furthermore, we demonstrate that through the temperature-dependent denaturation and recovery of IKK, TNFα and IL1β-mediated signalling exhibit different temperature sensitivity and adaptation to repeated HS when exposed to a 37-43 °C temperature range. Specifically, IL1β-mediated NF-κB responses are more robust to temperature changes in comparison to those induced by TNFα treatment. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the kinetics of the NF-κB system following temperature stress is cytokine specific and exhibit differential adaptation to temperature changes. We propose that this differential temperature sensitivity is mediated via the IKK signalosome, which acts as a bona fide temperature sensor trough the HSR cross-talk. This novel quantitative understanding of NF-κB and HSR interactions is fundamentally important for the potential optimization of therapeutic hyperthermia protocols.

In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the principal co-ordinator of the cell-autonomous clocks distributed across all major tissues. The importance of robust daily rhythms is highlighted by experimental and epidemiological associations between circadian disruption and human diseases. BMAL1 (a bHLH-PAS domain-containing transcription factor) is the master positive regulator within the transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) that cell-autonomously define circadian time. It drives transcription of the negative regulators Period and Cryptochrome alongside numerous clock output genes, and thereby powers circadian time-keeping. Because deletion of Bmal1 alone is sufficient to eliminate circadian rhythms in cells and the whole animal it has been widely used as a model for molecular disruption of circadian rhythms, revealing essential, tissue-specific roles of BMAL1 in, for example, the brain, liver and the musculoskeletal system. Moreover, BMAL1 has clock-independent functions that influence ageing and protein translation. Despite the essential role of BMAL1 in circadian time-keeping, direct measures of its intra-cellular behaviour are still lacking. To fill this knowledge-gap, we used CRISPR Cas9 to generate a mouse expressing a knock-in fluorescent fusion of endogenous BMAL1 protein (Venus::BMAL1) for quantitative live imaging in physiological settings. The Bmal1Venus mouse model enabled us to visualise and quantify the daily behaviour of this core clock factor in central (SCN) and peripheral clocks, with single-cell resolution that revealed its circadian expression, anti-phasic to negative regulators, nuclear-cytoplasmic mobility and molecular abundance.",,2,1,MRC,088785/Z/09/Z,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2020-04-01

Infected mice show both reduced weight loss and lower bacterial burden in circulating blood. In vivo studies of macrophage phagocytosis reveal increased bacterial ingestion following Bmal1 deletion, which was also seen in vitro. BMAL1-/- macrophages exhibited marked differences in actin cytoskeletal organization, a phosphoproteome enriched for cytoskeletal changes, with reduced phosphocofilin and increased active RhoA. Further analysis of the BMAL1-/- macrophages identified altered cell morphology and increased motility. Mechanistically, BMAL1 regulated a network of cell movement genes, 148 of which were within 100 kb of high-confidence BMAL1 binding sites. Links to RhoA function were identified, with 29 genes impacting RhoA expression or activation. RhoA inhibition restored the phagocytic phenotype to that seen in control macrophages. In summary, we identify a surprising gain of antibacterial function due to loss of BMAL1 in macrophages, associated with a RhoA-dependent cytoskeletal change, an increase in cell motility, and gain of phagocytic function.",Actin cytoskeleton | Circadian | Phagocytosis | RhoA | Streptococcus pneumoniae,24,1,BRC,MR/L006499/1,Manchester Biomedical Research Centre,papers by authors,0,2020-01-01

Here, we identify a striking change to these mechanisms resulting in a gain of amplitude and lack of synchrony within pulmonary fibrotic tissue. These changes result from an infiltration of mesenchymal cells, an important cell type in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Mutation of the core clock protein REVERBα in these cells exacerbated the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, whereas mutation of REVERBα in club or myeloid cells had no effect on the bleomycin phenotype. Knockdown of REVERBα revealed regulation of the little-understood transcription factor TBPL1. Both REVERBα and TBPL1 altered integrinβ1 focal-adhesion formation, resulting in increased myofibroblast activation. The translational importance of our findings was established through analysis of 2 human cohorts. In the UK Biobank, circadian strain markers (sleep length, chronotype, and shift work) are associated with pulmonary fibrosis, making them risk factors. In a separate cohort, REVERBα expression was increased in human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue.

In macrophage populations, TLR4 stimulates the dose-dependent transcription of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) target genes.

The TLR4-induced TNFA transcriptional response correlated with the extent of NF-κB signaling in the cells and their size. We compared the rates of TNF-α production and uptake in macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts and generated a mathematical model to explore the heterogeneity in the response of macrophages to TLR4 stimulation and the propagation of the TNF-α signal in the tissue. The model predicts that the local propagation of the TLR4-dependent TNF-α response and cellular NF-κB signaling are limited to small distances of a few cell diameters between neighboring tissue-resident macrophages. In our predictive model, TNF-α propagation was constrained by competitive uptake of TNF-α from the environment, rather than by heterogeneous production of the cytokine.

We find that calcium and kinase signaling cooperate to induce chromatin remodeling at ∼2100 chromatin regions, which demonstrate enriched binding motifs for inducible factors and correlate with target gene expression.We found that these regions typically function as inducible enhancers. Many of these elements contain composite NFAT/AP-1 sites, which typically support cooperative binding, thus further reinforcing the need for cooperation between calcium and kinase signaling in the activation of genes in T cells. In contrast, treatment with PMA or ionomycin alone induces chromatin remodeling at far fewer regions (∼600 and ∼350, respectively), which mostly represent a subset of those induced by costimulation.

However, the mechanism of action in mice remains unclear. In this study, the binding specificity of IFX for mouse TNF-α was investigated ex vivo using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry and Western blot. Infliximab (IFX) did not bind directly to soluble or membrane-bound mouse TNF-α nor did it have any effect on TNF-α-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) stimulation in mouse fibroblasts. The efficacy of IFX treatment was then investigated in vivo using a TNF-α-independent Trichuris muris-induced infection model of chronic colitis. Infection provoked severe transmural colonic inflammation by day 35 post-infection. Colonic pathology, macrophage phenotype and cell death were determined. As predicted from the in-vitro data, in-vivo treatment of T. muris-infected mice with IFX had no effect on clinical outcome, nor did it affect macrophage cell phenotype or number. IFX enhanced apoptosis of colonic immune cells significantly, likely to be driven by a direct effect of the humanized antibody itself. We have demonstrated that although IFX does not bind directly to TNF-α, observed anti-inflammatory effects in other mouse models may be through host cell apoptosis. We suggest that more careful consideration of xenogeneic responses should be made when utilizing IFX in preclinical models.",antibody | inflammation | macrophage | mucosa,12,1,FP7,305564,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,0,2017-02-01

We previously proposed that the timing of vertebrate neuronal differentiation is regulated by molecular oscillations of a transcriptional repressor, HES1, tuned by a posttranscriptional repressor, miR-9. Here, we computationally model the effects of intrinsic noise on the Hes1/miR-9 oscillator as a consequence of low molecular numbers of interacting species, determined experimentally. We report that increased stochasticity spreads the timing of differentiation in a population, such that initially equivalent cells differentiate over a period of time. Surprisingly, inherent stochasticity also increases the robustness of the progenitor state and lessens the impact of unequal, random distribution of molecules at cell division on the temporal spread of differentiation at the population level.

This refractory state is established in the signal transduction network downstream of TNFR and upstream of IKK, and depends on the level of the NF-κ B system negative feedback protein A20. If a second pulse within the refractory phase is IL-1β instead of TNFα, all of the cells respond. This suggests a mechanism by which two cytokines can synergistically activate an inflammatory response.

There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that intracellular signals encode temporal information. Thus, the dynamics of protein levels, as well as protein quantity and/or localization, impacts on cell fate. We hypothesized that such temporal encoding has a role in HIF signaling and cell fate decisions triggered by hypoxic conditions. Using live cell imaging in a controlled oxygen environment, we observed transient 3-h pulses of HIF-1α and -2α expression under continuous hypoxia. We postulated that the well described prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) oxygen sensors and HIF negative feedback regulators could be the origin of the pulsatile HIF dynamics. We used iterative mathematical modeling and experimental analysis to scrutinize which parameter of the PHD feedback could control HIF timing and we probed for the functional redundancy between the three main PHD proteins. We identified PHD2 as the main PHD responsible for HIF peak duration. We then demonstrated that this has important consequences, because the transient nature of the HIF pulse prevents cell death by avoiding transcription of p53-dependent pro-apoptotic genes. We have further shown the importance of considering HIF dynamics for coupling mathematical models by using a described HIF-p53 mathematical model. Our results indicate that the tight control of HIF transient dynamics has important functional consequences on the cross-talk with key signaling pathways controlling cell survival, which is likely to impact on HIF targeting strategies for hypoxia-associated diseases such as tumor progression and ischemia. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,35,1,MRC,MR/K015931/1,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2014-02-01

In this study, we exploit intrinsic fluorescent properties of thin GO sheets to establish the relationship between lateral dimensions of the material, its cellular uptake mechanisms and intracellular fate over time. Label-free GO with distinct lateral dimensions, small (s-GO) and ultra-small (us-GO) were thoroughly characterised both in water and in biologically relevant cell culture medium. Interactions of the material with a range of non-phagocytic mammalian cell lines (BEAS-2B, NIH/3T3, HaCaT, 293T) were studied using a combination of complementary analytical techniques (confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and TEM). The uptake mechanism was initially interrogated using a range of pharmaceutical inhibitors and validated using polystyrene beads of different diameters (0.1 and 1 μm). Subsequently, RNA-Seq was used to follow the changes in the uptake mechanism used to internalize s-GO flakes over time. Regardless of lateral dimensions, both types of GO were found to interact with the plasma membrane and to be internalized by a panel of cell lines studied. However, s-GO was internalized mainly via macropinocytosis while us-GO was mainly internalized via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Importantly, we report the shift from macropinocytosis to clathrin-dependent endocytosis in the uptake of s-GO at 24 h, mediated by upregulation of mTORC1/2 pathway. Finally, we show that both s-GO and us-GO terminate in lysosomal compartments for up to 48 h.

The effect of alternate promoter architecture on transcription bursting is not known. We studied the human prolactin (hPRL) gene that contains 2 promoters, a pituitary-specific promoter that requires the transcription factor Pit-1 and displays dramatic transcriptional bursting activity and an alternate upstream promoter that is active in nonpituitary tissues. We studied large hPRL genomic fragments with luciferase reporters, and used bacterial artificial chromosome recombineering to manipulate critical promoter regions. Stochastic switch mathematical modelling of single-cell time-lapse luminescence image data revealed that the Pit-1-dependent promoter showed longer, higher-amplitude transcriptional bursts. Knockdown studies confirmed that the presence of Pit-1 stabilized and prolonged periods of active transcription. Pit-1 therefore plays an active role in establishing the timing of transcription cycles, in addition to its cell-specific functions.",gene transcription | Pit-1 | pituitary | prolactin gene | promoter | transcription timing,0,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2021-04-01

To study both processes in the same living cell in real time, we used rat pituitary GH3 cells stably expressing human prolactin-luciferase or prolactin-EGFP reporter gene constructs loaded with a fluorescent calcium indicator and measured activity using single-cell time-lapse microscopy. We observed heterogeneity between clonal cells in the calcium activity and prolactin transcription in unstimulated conditions. There was a significant correlation between cells displaying spontaneous calcium spikes and cells showing spontaneous bursts in prolactin expression. Notably, cells showing no basal calcium activity showed low prolactin expression but elicited a significantly greater transcriptional response to BayK8644 compared to cells showing basal calcium activity. This suggested the presence of two subsets of cells within the population at any one time. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to sort cells into two populations based on the expression level of prolactin-EGFP however, the bimodal pattern of expression was restored within 26 h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that these sorted populations were distinct due to the extent of histone acetylation. We suggest that maintenance of a heterogeneous bimodal population is a fundamental characteristic of this cell type and that calcium activation and histone acetylation, at least in part, drive prolactin transcriptional competence.",Calcium | Chromatin | Heterogeneity | Prolactin | Single cell | Transcription,0,1,WT,091688,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0,2021-01-01

Aberrant NF-κB signalling is strongly associated with these conditions, and several established drugs influence the NF-κB signalling network to exert their effect. This study aimed to identify drugs that alter NF-κB signalling and could be repositioned for use in IBD. The SysmedIBD Consortium established a novel drug-repurposing pipeline based on a combination of in silico drug discovery and biological assays targeted at demonstrating an impact on NF-κB signalling, and a murine model of IBD. The drug discovery algorithm identified several drugs already established in IBD, including corticosteroids. The highest-ranked drug was the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin, which has previously been reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in aseptic conditions. The effects of clarithromycin effects were validated in several experiments: it influenced NF-κB-mediated transcription in murine peritoneal macrophages and intestinal enteroids; it suppressed NF-κB protein shuttling in murine reporter enteroids; it suppressed NF-κB (p65) DNA binding in the small intestine of mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide; and it reduced the severity of dextran sulphate sodium-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice. Clarithromycin also suppressed NF-κB (p65) nuclear translocation in human intestinal enteroids. These findings demonstrate that in silico drug repositioning algorithms can viably be allied to laboratory validation assays in the context of IBD, and that further clinical assessment of clarithromycin in the management of IBD is required.

Upon ligand binding, activated GR mediates cellular effects by regulating gene expression, but some GR effects can occur rapidly without new transcription. Here, we show that GCs rapidly inhibit cell migration, in response to both GR agonist and antagonist ligand binding. The inhibitory effect on migration is prevented by GR knockdown with siRNA, confirming GR specificity, but not by actinomycin D treatment, suggesting a nontranscriptional mechanism. We identified a rapid onset increase in microtubule polymerisation following GC treatment, identifying cytoskeletal stabilisation as the likely mechanism of action. HDAC6 overexpression, but not knockdown of αTAT1, rescued the GC effect, implicating HDAC6 as the GR effector. Consistent with this hypothesis, ligand-dependent cytoplasmic interaction between GR and HDAC6 was demonstrated by quantitative imaging. Taken together, we propose that activated GR inhibits HDAC6 function, and thereby increases the stability of the microtubule network to reduce cell motility. We therefore report a novel, non-Transcriptional mechanism whereby GCs impair cell motility through inhibition of HDAC6 and rapid reorganization of the cell architecture.",Cell migration | Glucocorticoid | HDAC6 | Microtubule | Quantitative imaging,1,1,WT,107849/Z/15/Z,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0,2020-06-01

Furthermore, ER stress stabilizes PERP at the PM and induces its increasing co-localization with SERCA2b at ER–PM junctions.

Mathematical modelling suggests that in progenitor cells the HES5 oscillator operates close to its bifurcation boundary where stochastic conversions between dynamics are possible. HES5 expression becomes more frequently periodic as cells transition to differentiation which, coupled with an overall decline in HES5 expression, creates a transient period of oscillations with higher fold expression change.

Following activation, samples could be segregated into three clusters based on the NF-κB-regulated luciferase response.

However, it still remains an open question as to what kind of cellular communication mediates the observed space-time organization. To determine the type of interaction between cells we developed a statistical model. The degree of similarity between two expression time series was studied in terms of two distance measures, Euclidean and geodesic, the latter being a network-theoretic distance defined to be the minimal number of edges between nodes, and this was used to discriminate between juxtacrine from paracrine signalling. The analysis presented here suggests that juxtacrine signalling dominates. To further determine whether the coupling is coordinating transcription or post-transcriptional activities we used stochastic switch modelling to infer the transcriptional profiles of cells and estimated their similarity measures to deduce that their spatial cellular coordination involves coupling of transcription via juxtacrine signalling. We developed a computational model that involves an inter-cell juxtacrine coupling, yielding simulation results that show space-time coordination in the transcription level that is in agreement with the above analysis. The developed model is expected to serve as the prototype for the further study of tissue-level organised gene expression for epigenetically regulated genes, such as prolactin.",,1,1,DAR,WT091688,"Deanship of Academic Research, University of Jordan",papers by authors,1,2019-06-01

We investigated how the dynamics and function of NF-κB were affected by temperature within the mammalian physiological range (34 °C to 40 °C). An increase in temperature led to an increase in NF-κB nuclear/cytoplasmic oscillation frequency following Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) stimulation. Mathematical modeling suggested that this temperature sensitivity might be due to an A20-dependent mechanism, and A20 silencing removed the sensitivity to increased temperature. The timing of the early response of a key set of NF-κB target genes showed strong temperature dependence. The cytokine-induced expression of many (but not all) later genes was insensitive to temperature change (suggesting that they might be functionally temperature-compensated). Moreover, a set of temperature- and TNFα-regulated genes were implicated in NF-κB cross-talk with key cell-fate–controlling pathways. In conclusion, NF-κB dynamics and target gene expression are modulated by temperature and can accurately transmit multidimensional information to control inflammation.",A20 | Dynamics | NF-κB | Temperature | Transcription,21,1,FP7,305564,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,1,2018-05-01

However, specific mechanisms linking the HS response pathways to major cellular signaling systems are not fully understood. Here we used integrated computational and experimental approaches to quantitatively analyze the crosstalk mechanisms between the HS-response and a master regulator of inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis the Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) system. We found that populations of human osteosarcoma cells, exposed to a clinically relevant 43°C HS had an attenuated NF-κB p65 response to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) treatment. The degree of inhibition of the NF-κB response depended on the HS exposure time. Mathematical modeling of single cells indicated that individual crosstalk mechanisms differentially encode HS-mediated NF-κB responses while being consistent with the observed population-level responses. In particular “all-or-nothing” encoding mechanisms were involved in the HS-dependent regulation of the IKK activity and IκBα phosphorylation, while others involving transport were “analogue”. In order to discriminate between these mechanisms, we used live-cell imaging of nuclear translocations of the NF-κB p65 subunit. The single cell responses exhibited “all-or-nothing” encoding. While most cells did not respond to TNFα stimulation after a 60 min HS, 27% showed responses similar to those not receiving HS. We further demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the predicted inhibition of IKK activity was consistent with the observed HS-dependent depletion of the IKKα and IKKβ subunits in whole cell lysates. However, a combination of “all-or-nothing” crosstalk mechanisms was required to completely recapitulate the single cell data. We postulate therefore that the heterogeneity of the single cell responses might be explained by the cell-intrinsic variability of HS-modulated IKK signaling. In summary, we show that high temperature modulates NF-κB responses in single cells in a complex and unintuitive manner, which needs to be considered in hyperthermia-based treatment strategies.",,7,1,NSF,1361411,National Science Foundation,papers by authors,0,2018-04-01

Based on previously described pulmonary safety concerns for carbon nanomaterials, there is a great need to define parameters guiding interactions between graphene-based materials and the pulmonary system. The aim of the present study was to determine the importance of two critical parameters: lateral dimensions of the material and coating with proteins in relation to each other and their pulmonary impact. Endotoxin-free materials with distinct lateral dimensions, s-GO (50-200 nm) and l-GO (5-15 μm), were produced and thoroughly characterized. Exploiting intrinsic fluorescence of graphene oxide (GO) and using confocal live-cell imaging, the behavior of the cells in response to the material was visualized in real time. Although BEAS-2B cells internalized GO efficiently, l-GO was linked to higher plasma membrane interactions correlated with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, pro-inflammatory response, and greater cytotoxicity, in agreement with the oxidative stress paradigm. For both GO types, the presence of serum alleviated lipid peroxidation of plasma membrane and decreased intracellular ROS levels. However, protein coating was not enough to entirely mitigate toxicity and inflammatory response induced by l-GO. In vitro results were validated in vivo, as l-GO was more prone to induce pulmonary granulomatous response in mice compared to s-GO. In conclusion, the lateral dimension of GO played a more important role than serum protein coating in determining biological responses to the material. It was also demonstrated that time-lapse imaging of live cells interacting with label-free GO sheets can be used as a tool to assess GO-induced cytotoxicity.",2D materials | confocal live-cell imaging | graphene | inflammation | lungs | nanotoxicology,46,1,WT,FP7-ICT-2013-FET-F-604391,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0,2018-02-01

Recent studies identified a spectrum of transcriptionally active “on-states,” interspersed with periods of inactivity, but these “off-states” and the process of transcriptional deactivation are poorly understood. To examine what occurs during deactivation, we investigate the dynamics of switching between variable rates. We measured live single-cell expression of luciferase reporters from human growth hormone or human prolactin promoters in a pituitary cell line. Subsequently, we applied a statistical variable-rate model of transcription, validated by single-molecule FISH, to estimate switching between transcriptional rates. Under the assumption that transcription can switch to any rate at any time, we found that transcriptional activation occurs predominantly as a single switch, whereas deactivation occurs with graded, stepwise decreases in transcription rate. Experimentally altering cAMP signalling with forskolin or chromatin remodelling with histone deacetylase inhibitor modifies the duration of defined transcriptional states. Our findings reveal transcriptional activation and deactivation as mechanistically independent, asymmetrical processes.

In vitro, it efficiently hydrolysed NADH to NMNH and AMP and NADPH to NMNH and 2′,5′-ADP and had a marked preference for the reduced pyridine nucleotides. Much lower activity was obtained with other nucleotide substrates tested. Km and kcat values for NADH were 0.34 mM and 7 s−1 respectively.

Once activated, they trigger a signalling cascade that leads to NF-Î° B translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Single cell analysis shows that NF-Î° B signalling dynamics are a critical determinant of transcriptional regulation. Moreover, the outcome of innate immune response is also affected by the cross-talk between TLRs and estrogen signalling. Here, we characterized the dynamics of TLR5 signalling, responsible for the recognition of flagellated bacteria, and those changes induced by estradiol in its signalling at the single cell level. TLR5 activation in MCF7 cells induced a single and sustained NF-k B translocation into the nucleus that resulted in high NF-k B transcription activity. The overall magnitude of NF-k B transcription activity was not influenced by the duration of the stimulus. No significant changes are observed in the dynamics of NF-k B translocation to the nucleus when MCF7 cells are incubated with estradiol. However, estradiol significantly decreased NF-k B transcriptional activity while increasing TLR5-mediated AP-1 transcription. The effect of estradiol on transcriptional activity was dependent on the estrogen receptor activated. This fine tuning seems to occur mainly in the nucleus at the transcription level rather than affecting the translocation of the NF-k B transcription factor.",,8,1,H2020,668989,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,papers by authors,1,2017-01-01

Intriguingly, PERP is not induced in UM despite functional p53. p63, located on chromosome 3, which is characteristically altered in high-risk UM, can transactivate PERP. Here, we determine the functional role of p63 expression in the initiation of p53/PERP-mediated apoptosis in UM. Methods: PERP expression was monitored by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and immunoblotting in UM cell lines treated with DNA-damaging agents. The functional role of p63 was assessed by transient expression of p63-turbo GFP (p63-tGFP) in the apoptosis- resistant, 3q-deficient OCM-1 cells. Expression and localisation of p63, PERP and p53, and induction of apoptosis were characterised by qPCR, immunoblotting and live cell confocal microscopy. Results: PERP expression was significantly downregulated in all UM cell lines. DNA-damaging treatments failed to induce apoptosis and activate PERP in OCM-1 cells, which displayed non-functional levels of p63. Expression of p63-tGFP induced apoptosis with marked increase in PERP expression and associated p53 accumulation.

The principal clock in mammals is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. In SCN neurons, auto-regulatory feedback on core clock genes Period (Per) and Cryptochrome (Cry) following nuclear entry of their protein products is the basis of circadian oscillation [1, 2]. In Drosophila clock neurons, the movement of dPer into the nucleus is subject to a circadian gate that generates a delay in the TTFL, and this delay is thought to be critical for oscillation [3, 4]. Analysis of the Drosophila clock has strongly influenced models of the mammalian clock, and such models typically infer complex spatiotemporal, intracellular behaviors of mammalian clock proteins. There are, however, no direct measures of the intracellular behavior of endogenous circadian proteins to support this: dynamic analyses have been limited and often have no circadian dimension [5–7]. We therefore generated a knockin mouse expressing a fluorescent fusion of native PER2 protein (PER2::VENUS) for live imaging. PER2::VENUS recapitulates the circadian functions of wild-type PER2 and, importantly, the behavior of PER2::VENUS runs counter to the Drosophila model: it does not exhibit circadian gating of nuclear entry. Using fluorescent imaging of PER2::VENUS, we acquired the first measures of mobility, molecular concentration, and localization of an endogenous circadian protein in individual mammalian cells, and we showed how the mobility and nuclear translocation of PER2 are regulated by casein kinase.

Using BAC recombineering, we have manipulated a 160-kb human prolactin luciferase (hPRL-Luc) BAC construct and mutated the previously defined proximal estrogen response element (ERE) located -1189 bp relative to the transcription start site, to assess its involvement in the estrogen responsiveness of the entire hPRL locus. We found that GH3 cell lines stably expressing Luc under control of the ERE-mutated hPRL promoter (ERE-Mut) displayed a dramatically reduced transcriptional response to 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment compared with cells expressing Luc from the wild-type (WT) ERE hPRL-Luc promoter (ERE-WT). The -1189 ERE controls not only the response to E2 treatment but also the acute transcriptional response to TNFα, which was abolished in ERE-Mut cells. ERE-WT cells displayed a biphasic transcriptional response after TNFα treatment, the acute phase of which was blocked after treatment with the estrogen receptor antagonist 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen. Unexpectedly, we show the oscillatory characteristics of hPRL promoter activity in individual living cells were unaffected by disruption of this crucial response element, real-time bioluminescence imaging showed that transcription cycles were maintained, with similar cycle lengths, in ERE-WT and ERE-Mut cells. These data suggest the -1189 ERE is the dominant response element involved in the hPRL transcriptional response to both E2 and TNFα and, crucially, that cycles of hPRL promoter activity are independent of estrogen receptor binding.",,4,1,WT,WT091688,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,2,2016-02-01

We have identified an unexpected role for GR in mitosis. We discovered that specifically modified GR species accumulate at the mitotic spindle during mitosis in a distribution that overlaps with Aurora kinases. We found that Aurora A was required to mediate mitosis-driven GR phosphorylation, but not recruitment of GR to the spindle. GR was necessary for mitotic progression, with increased time to complete mitosis, frequency of mitotic aberrations, and death inmitosis observed following GR knockdown. Complementation studies revealed an essential role for the GR ligand-binding domain, but no clear requirement for ligand binding in regulating chromosome segregation. The GR N-terminal domain, and specifically phosphosites S203 and S211, were not required. Reduced GR expression results in a cell cycle phenotype, with isolated cells from mouse and human subjects showing changes in chromosome content over prolonged passage. Furthermore, GR haploinsufficient mice have an increased incidence of tumor formation, and, strikingly, these tumors are further depleted for GR, implying additional GR loss as a consequence of cell transformation. We identified reduced GR expression in a panel of human liver, lung, prostate, colon, and breast cancers. We therefore reveal an unexpected role for the GR in promoting accurate chromosome segregation during mitosis, which is causally linked to tumorigenesis, making GR an authentic tumor suppressor gene.",Aneuploidy | Cancer | DNA damage | Glucocorticoid receptor | Mitosis,29,1,MRC,MR/K015885/1,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2015-04-01

It has some unusual properties compared to other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, and its expression and function are dynamically regulated by a variety of post-transcriptional and post-translational processes. Of note, Mcl-1 protein has a very short half life, and its stability and function may be regulated by reversible phosphorylation. There is also evidence to suggest that it may be localized to different subcellular compartments. The aim of this work was to determine whether residues within the PEST region of Mcl-1 that may undergo reversible phosphorylation, also regulate its subcellular distribution. We show that EGFP:Mcl-1 localizes mainly to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, with some additional cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. The mutations, S64A, S64E, S121A, S159A, T163A and T163E did not significantly affect the localization of Mcl-1. However, mutation of Ser162 to the phospho-null residue, Alanine resulted in an essentially nuclear localization, with some cytoplasmic but no mitochondrial localization. This mutant Mcl-1 protein, S162A, showed significantly decreased stability and it decreased the ability to protect against Bak-induced apoptosis. These data identify a new molecular determinant of Mcl-1 function, localization and stability that may be important for understanding the role of this protein in disease. © 2012 Thomas et al.",,9,1,BBSRC,BB/E012965/1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,2,2012-09-01

Antibodies against the cytoskeletal components vimentin and alpha tubulin were used to analyse cell morphology; nuclei were stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and images were collected using conventional and confocal microscopy. Both cranial and caudal CLs contained cells of heterogenous morphologies. Cells were arranged between collagen bundles and frequently had cytoplasmic processes. Some of these processes were long (type A cells), others were shorter, thicker and more branched (type B cells), and some had no processes (type C cells). Processes were frequently shown to contact other cells, extending longitudinally and transversely through the CLs. Cells with longer processes had fusiform nuclei, and those with no processes had rounded nuclei and were more frequent in the mid-substance of both CLs. Cells with long processes were more commonly noted in the CLs of the Greyhound. As contact between cells may facilitate direct communication, variances in cell morphology between breeds at a differing risk of CCL rupture may reflect differences in CL physiology. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Canine | Cells | Cruciate ligament | Morphology,6,0,BBSRC,BB/F017502/1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,1,2012-08-01

In contrast to many other nuclear receptors, GR is thought to be exclusively cytoplasmic in quiescent cells, and only translocate to the nucleus on ligand binding. We now demonstrate significant nuclear GR in the absence of ligand, which requires nuclear localisation signal 1 (NLS1). Live cell imaging reveals dramatic GR import into the nucleus through interphase and rapid exclusion of the GR from the nucleus at the onset of mitosis, which persists into early G 1. This suggests that the heterogeneity in GR distribution is reflective of cell cycle phase. The impact of cell cycle-driven GR trafficking on a panel of glucocorticoid actions was profiled. In G2/M-enriched cells there was marked prolongation of glucocorticoid-induced ERK activation. This was accompanied by DNA template-specific, ligand-independent GR transactivation. Using chimeric and domain-deleted receptors we demonstrate that this transactivation effect is mediated by the AF1 transactivation domain. AF-1 harbours multiple phosphorylation sites, which are consensus sequences for kinases including CDKs, whose activity changes during the cell cycle. In G2/M there was clear ligand independent induction of GR phosphorylation on residues 203 and 211, both of which are phosphorylated after ligand activation. Ligand-independent transactivation required induction of phospho-S211GR but not S203GR, thereby directly linking cell cycle driven GR modification with altered GR function. Cell cycle phase therefore regulates GR localisation and post-translational modification which selectively impacts GR activity. This suggests that cell cycle phase is an important determinant in the cellular response to Gc, and that mitotic index contributes to tissue Gc sensitivity. © 2011 Matthews et al.",,24,1,WT,BB/H013725/2,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,1,2011-08-01

Pyridalyl action requires cytochrome P450 activity, possibly for production of a bioactive derivative, Pyridalyl metabolism being prevented by general P450 inhibitors. Apoptosis is apparently not involved in the cytotoxicity. Continuous culture of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells in sub-lethal doses of Pyridalyl, results in a Pyridalyl-resistant cell line. Probing the molecular action of Pyridalyl by comparison of the proteomes of Pyridalyl-resistant and -susceptible cell lines, revealed differential expression of a number of proteins, including the up-regulation of thiol peroxiredoxin (TPx), in the resistant cells. Treatment of Bombyx mori larvae with Pyridalyl, followed by comparison of the midgut microsomal sub-proteome, revealed the up-regulation of three proteasome subunits. Such subunits, together with Hsp70 stress proteins, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDHs) and thiol peroxiredoxin (TPx) were also up-regulated in the whole proteome of B. mori BM36 cells following treatment with the insecticide. The foregoing results lead to the hypothesis that cytochrome P450 action leads to an active Pyridalyl metabolite, which results in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that leads to damage to cellular macromolecules (e.g., proteins) and enhanced proteasome activity leads to increased protein degradation and necrotic cell death. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Insecticide | Lepidoptera | Molecular action | Proteomics | Pyridalyl | ROS,25,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2011-07-01

Twelve pairs of cruciate ligaments (CLs) were obtained from 10 adult dogs with no evidence of knee osteoarthritis. Elastic fibres were identified using Verhoeff's and Miller's staining. Fibrillins 1 and 2 were immunolocalised and imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Hydrated, unfixed tissue was analysed using Nomarski differential interference microscopy (NDIC), allowing structural and mechanical analysis. Microfibrils and elastin fibres were widespread in both CLs, predominantly within ligament fascicles, parallel to collagen bundles. Although elastin fibres were sparse, microfibrils were abundant. We described abundant fibres composed of both fibrillin 1 and fibrillin 2, which had a similar pattern of distribution to oxytalan fibres. NDIC demonstrated complex interfascicular and interbundle anatomy in the CL complex. The distribution of elastin fibres is suggestive of a mechanical role in bundle reorganisation following ligament deformation. The presence and location of fibrillin 2 in oxytalan fibres in ligament differs from the solely fibrillin 1-containing oxytalan fibres previously described in tendon and may demonstrate a fundamental difference between ligament and tendon. © 2011 The Authors.

To investigate the origins of this behavior and to understand its functional relevance, we quantitatively analyzed this variability using new mathematical tools that allowed us to reconstruct dynamic transcription rates of different reporter genes controlled by identical promoters in the same living cell. Quantitative microscopic analysis of two reporter genes, firefly luciferase and destabilized EGFP, was used to analyze the dynamics of prolactin promoter-directed gene expression in living individual clonal and primary pituitary cells over periods of up to 25 h. We quantified the time-dependence and cyclicity of the transcription pulses and estimated the length and variation of active and inactive transcription phases. We showed an average cycle period of approximately 11 h and demonstrated that while the measured time distribution of active phases agreed with commonly accepted models of transcription, the inactive phases were differently distributed and showed strong memory, with a refractory period of transcriptional inactivation close to 3 h. Cycles in transcription occurred at two distinct prolactin-promoter controlled reporter genes in the same individual clonal or primary cells. However, the timing of the cycles was independent and out-of-phase. For the first time, we have analyzed transcription dynamics from two equivalent loci in real-time in single cells. In unstimulated conditions, cells showed independent transcription dynamics at each locus. A key result from these analyses was the evidence for a minimum refractory period in the inactive-phase of transcription. The response to acute signals and the result of manipulation of histone acetylation was consistent with the hypothesis that this refractory period corresponded to a phase of chromatin remodeling which significantly increased the cyclicity. Stochastically timed bursts of transcription in an apparently random subset of cells in a tissue may thus produce an overall coordinated but heterogeneous phenotype capable of acute responses to stimuli. © 2011 Harper et al.",,154,1,EPSRC,EP/C544587/1,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,0,2011-04-01

Endothelial cell activation and apoptosis are thought to be pivotal in the pathogenesis of this disease, but the mechanisms that mediate this remain unknown. Methods: Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were cultured with healthy control neutrophils in the presence of 25% healthy control or SSc serum for 24 h. Apoptosis was measured by annexin V-FITC binding and endothelial cell activation was measured using an allophycocyanin-conjugated E-selectin antibody. Fluorescence was quantified and localised using confocal microscopy. Results: SSc serum resulted in significantly increased apoptosis (p=0.006) and E-selectin expression (p=0.00004) in endothelial cells compared with control serum, effects that were critically dependent on the presence of neutrophils. Recombinant interleukin 6 (IL-6) reproduced these findings. Immunodepletion of IL-6 and the use of an IL-6 neutralising antibody decreased the effect of SSc serum on E-selectin expression. Soluble gp130, which specifically blocks IL-6 trans-signalling, negated the effect of SSc serum on both E-selectin expression and apoptosis. Conclusions: SSc serum induces endothelial cell activation and apoptosis in endothelial cell-neutrophil co-cultures, mediated largely by IL-6 and dependent on the presence of neutrophils. Together with other pathologically relevant effects of IL-6, these data justify further exploration of IL-6 as a therapeutic target in SSc.",,45,1,MRC,G0600404,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2011-02-01

In this report, we show that semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) coated with dextrans are highly luminescent, and stable, under a wide range of conditions in the presence of reagents and metabolites such as those which are commonly encountered in biological detection and imaging. Stability is monitored by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) titrations with fluorescent avidin, and their use under physiologicalconditions is demonstrated by tracking their progress in living cells. The surface chemistry is not disrupted by physiological (10 mM) concentrations of glutathione, making them compatible with intracellular environments. Dextran-coated QDs conjugated to streptavidin bind only to the surface of cells that have been biotinylated.

Double-label immunofluorescence and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to examine the hypothalamic sections from the follicular phase ewes. Noradrenergic terminals were in close contact with 65.7 ± 6.1% corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and 84.6 ± 3.2% arginine vasopressin (AVP) cell bodies in the paraventricular nucleus but not with β-endorphin cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus. Furthermore, γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) terminals were close to 80.9 ± 3.5% CRH but no AVP cell bodies in the paraventricular nucleus, as well as 60.8 ± 4.1%β-endorphin cell bodies in the arcuate nucleus. Although CRH, AVP and β-endorphin cell terminals were identified in the medial pre-optic area, no direct contacts with GnRH cell bodies were observed. Within the median eminence, abundant CRH but not AVP terminals were close to GnRH cell terminals in the external zone; whereas, β-endorphin cells and terminals were in the internal zone. In conclusion, neuroanatomical evidence is provided for the ewe supporting the hypothesis that brainstem noradrenergic and hypothalamic GABA neurones are important in modulating the activity of CRH and AVP neurones in the paraventricular nucleus, as well as β-endorphin neurones in the arcuate nucleus. These paraventricular and arcuate neurones may also involve interneurones to influence GnRH cell bodies in medial pre-optic area, whereas the median eminence may provide a major site for direct modulation of GnRH release by CRH terminals. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,13,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2010-12-01

Here we show that in the NF-κB signaling system, the precise timing of a dual-delayed negative feedback motif [involving stochastic transcription of inhibitor κB (IκB)-α and -ε] is optimized to induce heterogeneous timing of NF-κB oscillations between individual cells. We suggest that this dual-delayed negative feedback motif enables NF-κB signaling to generate robust single cell oscillations by reducing sensitivity to key parameter perturbations. Simultaneously, enhanced cell heterogeneity may represent a mechanism that controls the overall coordination and stability of cell population responses by decreasing temporal fluctuations of paracrine signaling. It has often been thought that dynamic biological systems may have evolved to maximize robustness through cell-to-cell coordination and homogeneity. Our analyses suggest in contrast, that this cellular variation might be advantageous and subject to evolutionary selection. Alternative types of therapy could perhaps be designed to modulate this cellular heterogeneity.",Biological oscillations | Feedback regulation | Network topology | NF-κB | Paracrine signaling,127,1,MRC,G0500346,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2010-06-01

Using several MB cell lines, we have demonstrated that the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide induces a p53-and caspase-dependent cell death. We have observed an additional caspase-independent cell death mechanism involving delayed nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity. The delayed induction was controlled by a p53-dependent transcription step and the production of death receptors (especially CD95/Fas). We further demonstrated that in both MB and glioblastoma (GM) cell lines, in which the p53 pathway was not functional, no p65 activation could be detected upon etoposide treatment. MB cell lines that have mutations in p53 or NF-κB are either less sensitive (NF-κB mutant) or even completely resistant (p53 mutant) to chemotherapeutic intervention. The optimal cell death was only achieved when both p53 and NF-κB were switched on. Taken together, our results shed light on the mechanism of NF-κB activation by etoposide in brain tumours and show that the genetic background of MB and GM cells determines their sensitivity to chemotherapy and has to be taken into account for efficient therapeutic intervention. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",CD95/Fas | DNA damaging agents | Glioblastoma | Medulloblastoma | NF-κB | p53,29,1,BBSRC,BBC5204711,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,1,2010-05-01

Prolactin promoter activity in transgenic pituitaries varied with time across different regions of the gland. Although amplitude of transcriptional responses differed, all regions of the gland displayed similar overall patterns of reporter gene expression over a 50-hour period, implying overall coordination of cellular behaviour. By contrast, enzymatically dispersed pituitary cell cultures showed unsynchronised fluctuations of promoter activity amongst different cells, suggesting that transcriptional patterns were constrained by tissue architecture. Short-term, high resolution, single cell analyses in prolactin-d2EGFP transgenic pituitary slice preparations showed varying transcriptional patterns with little correlation between adjacent cells.

In eukaryotes, mRNA decay is generally initiated by removal of the poly(A) tail mediated by the Ccr4-Caf1-Not complex. Deadenylated transcripts are then rapidly degraded, primarily via the decapping-dependent pathway. Components of this pathway can be localized into highly dynamic cytoplasmic foci, the mRNA processing (P)-bodies. We have undertaken confocal fluorescence microscopy to monitor P-bodies in Aspergillus nidulans. As in other organisms a dynamic shift in P-body formation occurs in response to diverse physiological signals. Significantly, both this cellular response and the signalled degradation of specific transcripts are dependent on the nuclease activity of Caf1 but not Ccr4. P-body formation is disrupted in A. nidulans strains deleted for Edc3, an enhancer of decapping, or CutA, which encodes a nucleotidyltransferase that triggers mRNA decapping by the addition of a CUCU tag to the poly(A) tail. As with ΔcutA, Δedc3 led to reduced rates of transcript degradation. These data link P-bodies to both the optimization and regulation of transcript degradation. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,20,1,BBSRC,BB/E017657/1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,0,2010-01-01

Importantly, using bioinformatics tools, we show that cathepsin L is able to cleave more than a third of the human proteome, indicating that this degradation process is likely to happen to most nanoparticles conjugated with peptides and proteins and cannot be ignored in the design of nanomaterials for intracellular applications.

In primary uveal melanoma (UM), the most common intraocular malignancy in adults that has a reportedly unaffected signalling pathway upstream of and including p53, PERP expression is down-regulated in the metastatic monosomy 3-type tumours, compared with the less aggressive disomy 3-type tumours. Here, we demonstrate experimentally, by the use of full-length PERP-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusions and real-time confocal microscopy, the intracellular targeting and plasma membrane localization of PERP in living UM cells and show that expression of PERP induces caspase-mediated apoptosis in UM cells. Induction of PERP expression in GFP-PERP-transfected UM cells leads to increased levels of cleaved caspase-8 forms, as well as to reduction of its full-length substrate Bid, but not to detectable processing of caspase-9. The levels of mature caspase-8, -9 and -3 proteins significantly correlate with PERP expression levels in primary UMs. Transcriptional profiling of PERP and caspase-8 in tumour specimens indicates that the positive association of PERP and caspase-8 proteins is a consequence of post-translational processing, most likely at the level of caspase-8 cleavage, and not of increased transcription of pro-caspase-8. We conclude that PERP expression leads to activation of an extrinsic receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway, with a possible subsequent engagement of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The findings underline the apoptotic pathway mediated by PERP as a critical mechanism employed by UM tumours to modulate susceptibility to apoptosis. © 2009 Foundation for Cellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Apoptosis | Caspase | Green fluorescent protein | P53 | PERP | Transfection | Uveal melanoma,35,1,BBSRC,BB/E012965/1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,0,2009-08-01

Experiments using high content live cell imaging will generate multiple large datasets that are often stored in an ad-hoc manner. This hinders identification of previously gathered data that may be relevant to current analyses. Whilst solutions exist for managing image data, they are primarily concerned with storage and retrieval of the images themselves and not the data derived from the images. There is therefore a requirement for an information management solution that facilitates the indexing of experimental metadata and results of high content live cell imaging experiments. Results: We have designed and implemented a data model and information management solution for the data gathered through high content live cell imaging experiments. Many of the experiments to be stored measure the translocation of fluorescently labelled proteins from cytoplasm to nucleus in individual cells. The functionality of this database has been enhanced by the addition of an algorithm that automatically annotates results of these experiments with the timings of translocations and periods of any oscillatory translocations as they are uploaded to the repository. Testing has shown the algorithm to perform well with a variety of previously unseen data. Conclusion: Our repository is a fully functional example of how high throughput imaging data may be effectively indexed and managed to address the requirements of end users. By implementing the automated analysis of experimental results, we have provided a clear impetus for individuals to ensure that their data forms part of that which is stored in the repository. Although focused on imaging, the solution provided is sufficiently generic to be applied to other functional proteomics and genomics experiments.

The approach combines the advantages of bacterial artificial chromosome recombineering to report appropriate regulation of gene expression by distant elements, with double reporter activity for the study of highly dynamic promoter regulation in vivo and ex vivo. We show first that this rat transgenic model allows quantitative in vivo imaging of gene expression in the pituitary gland, allowing the study of pulsatile dynamic activity of the PRL promoter in normal endocrine cells in different physiological states. Using the dual reporters in combination, dramatic and unexpected changes in PRL expression were observed after inflammatory challenge. Expression of PRL was shown by RT-PCR to be driven by activation of the alternative upstream extrapituitary promoter and flow cytometry analysis pointed at diverse immune cells expressing the reporter gene. These studies demonstrate the effective use of this type of model for molecular physiology and illustrate the potential for providing novel insight into human gene expression using a heterologous system.

We have previously reported that chemokine-induced TEM is defective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and that this defect is a result of failure of the chemokine to induce polar clustering of αLβ2; engagement of α4β1 and autocrine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) restore clustering and TEM. The aim of the present study was to characterize the nature of this defect in αLβ2 activation and determine how it is corrected. We show here that the αLβ2 of CLL cells is already in variably activated conformations, which are not further altered by chemokine treatment. Importantly, such treatment usually does not cause an increase in the GTP-loading of Rap1, a GTPase central to chemokine-induced activation of integrins. Furthermore, we show that this defect in Rap1 GTP-loading is at the level of the GTPase and is corrected in CLL cells cultured in the absence of exogenous stimuli, suggesting that the defect is the result of in vivo stimulation. Finally, we show that, because Rap1-induced activation of both α4β1 and αLβ2 is defective, autocrine VEGF and chemokine are necessary to activate α4β1 for ligand binding. Subsequently, this binding and both VEGF and chemokine stimulation are all needed for αLβ2 activation for motility and TEM. The present study not only clarifies the nature of the αLβ2 defect of CLL cells but is the first to implicate activation of Rap1 in the pathophysiology of CLL. ©2008 American Association for Cancer Research.",,24,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2008-10-01

ROS activity is usually studied by measuring indirect end-points of their reactions with various biomolecules. In order to develop a method to measure the intracellular ROS generation in real-time in mature skeletal muscle fibers, these were isolated from the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle of mice and cultured on collagen-coated plates. Fibers were loaded with 5- (and 6-) chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-DCFH DA) and measurements of 5- (and 6-) chloromethyl-2′,7′- dichlorofluorescin (CM-DCF) fluorescence from individual fibers obtained by microscopy over 45 min. The sensitivity of this approach was demonstrated by addition of 1 μM H2O2 to the extracellular medium. Contractions of isolated fibers induced by field electrical stimulation caused a significant increase in CM-DCF fluorescence that was abolished by pre-treatment of fibers with glutathione ethyl ester. Thus, CM-DCF fluorescence microscopy can detect physiologically relevant changes in intracellular ROS activity in single isolated mature skeletal muscle fibers in real-time, and contractions generated a net increase that was abolished when the intracellular glutathione content was enhanced. This technique has advantages over previous approaches because of the maturity of the fibers and the analysis of single cells, which prevent contributions from nonmuscle cells. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2008.",,76,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2008-08-01

Because TOPO-capped QDs are assembled instead of their water-soluble equivalents, the microspheres are highly luminescent. The amount of QDs assembled depends only on the surface area of the substrate, and therefore, the photoluminescence intensity increased uniformly in proportion to the number of QD layers assembled. The outer shell of silica nanoparticles confers stability on the assembled QDs but has no effect on their photoluminescence because it is transparent to excitatory and emitted light. It was activated with aminosilane and functionalized with a recognition surface of protein antigens using disulfide exchange chemistry.

These activating mutations are associated with an X-linked form of neutropenia with an intrinsic failure of myelopoiesis and an increase in the incidence of cytogenetic abnormalities. To study the underlying mechanisms, active mutant WASpI294T was expressed by gene transfer. This caused enhanced and delocalized actin polymerization throughout the cell, decreased proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Cells became binucleated, suggesting a failure of cytokinesis, and micronuclei were formed, indicative of genomic instability. Live cell imaging demonstrated a delay in mitosis from prometaphase to anaphase and confirmed that multinucleation was a result of aborted cytokinesis. During mitosis, filamentous actin was abnormally localized around the spindle and chromosomes throughout their alignment and separation, and it accumulated within the cleavage furrow around the spindle midzone. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for inhibition of myelopoiesis through defective mitosis and cytokinesis due to hyperactivation and mislocalization of actin polymerization.

Here, we describe that the α isoform of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) protein family exerts such silencing on several E2F-targeted genes. Among the different isoforms, HP1α levels progressively increase throughout differentiation and take over HP1γ binding on E2F sites in mature neurons. When overexpressed, only HP1α is able to ensure a timed repression of E2F genes. Specific inhibition of HP1α expression drives neuronal progenitors either towards death or cell cycle progression, yet preventing the expression of the neuronal marker microtubule-associated protein 2. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this mechanism occurs in cerebellar granule neurons in vivo, during the postnatal development of the cerebellum. Finally, our results suggest that E2F-targeted genes are packaged into higher-order chromatin structures in mature neurons relative to neuroblasts, likely reflecting a transition from a 'repressed' versus 'silenced' status of these genes.

Ala25Ser precursor cystatin C shows a dual distribution to the Golgi apparatus and to the mitochondria. This localisation is thus intermediary between that of wild-type cystatin C (targeted to ER/Golgi compartment) and that of variant B precursor cystatin C.

The retinal pigment epithelium forms a continuous monolayer of polarised cells immediately bellow the neuroretina, and is integral to the homeostasis of photoreceptor cells. While osteonectin is expressed by normal retinal pigment epithelium in situ, its expression is significantly increased in retinal pigment epithelial cells associated with several common retinal diseases. This pattern of expression implies an important role for osteonectin in the biology of retinal pigment epithelial cells. However, the trafficking, processing, and eventual fate of osteonectin in these cells is not clear at present. Although the theoretical report of a leader sequence within the osteonectin open reading frame and its extracellular presence in some tissues indirectly support secretion of the protein, there is no direct experimental demonstration of the secretion route to date. As a first step towards understanding the role of osteonectin in retinal pigment epithelium, we studied the intracellular distribution and trafficking of the protein in living cells. Here, we present experimental evidence that a precursor osteonectin fusion protein is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway, with a likely basal secretion in retinal pigment epithelial cells. In addition, we show that the precursor osteonectin protein having the leader sequence masked fails to undergo secretion leading to cell death, a phenotype which may be of relevance not only for retinal pathology, but also for other diseases such as the bone disorder known as pseudoachondroplasia that is associated with a lack of osteonectin secretion. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We describe CellTracker, a software tool designed for the automated measurement of the cellular location and intensity of fluorescently tagged proteins. CellTracker runs in the MS Windows environment, is freely available (at http://www.dbkgroup.org/celltracker/), and combines automated cell tracking methods with powerful image-processing algorithms that are optimized for these applications. When tested in an application involving the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB, CellTracker is competitive in accuracy with the manual human analysis of such images but is more than 20 times faster, even on a small task where human fatigue is not an issue.

Moreover, ASM progenitors produce fibroblast growth factor-10 (FGF-10) for lung morphogenesis. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is associated with lung hypoplasia, FGF-10 deficiency, and postnatal ASM dysfunction. We hypothesized ASM dysfunction emerges in tandem with, and may contribute toward, the primordial lung hypoplasia that precedes experimental CDH. Spatial origin and frequency of ASM peristaltic waves were measured in normal and hypoplastic rat lungs cultured from day 13.5 of gestation (lung hypoplasia was generated by nitrofen dosing of pregnant dams). Longitudinal lung growth was assayed by bud counts and tracing photomicrographs of cultures. Coupling of lung growth and peristalsis was tested by stimulation studies using serum, FGF-10, or nicotine and inhibition studies with nifedipine or U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor). In normal lung, ASM peristalsis is developmentally regulated: proximal ASM becomes quiescent (while retaining capacity for cholinergic-stimulated peristalsis). However, in hypoplastic lung, spontaneous proximal ASM activity persists. FGF-10 corrects this aberrant ASM activity in tandem with improved growth. Stimulation and inhibition studies showed that, unlike normal lung, changes in growth or peristalsis are not consistently accompanied by parallel modulation of the other. ASM peristalsis undergoes FGF-10-regulated spatiotemporal development coupled to lung growth: this process is disrupted early in lung hypoplasia. ASM dysfunction emerges in tandem with and may therefore contribute toward lung hypoplasia in CDH.

New methods of preparing encoded particles promise to alleviate this problem, but in the face of a growing number of new technologies it is sometimes difficult to decide which, if any, will succeed.

CD55 & CD59, two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, have been detected previously in some studies also in the acrosomal region of chemically fixed spermatozoa but never demonstrated at this site on unfixed spermatozoa. Dual labelling immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy on fresh unfixed spermatozoa, with minimal subsequent time to fixation, has shown CD55 to be markedly expressed on the IAM, more than on the plasma membrane. However, unlike for CD46, CD55 displayed patchy staining over the acrosome, with some variation between individual spermatozoa. All IAM-associated CD55 was localised within GM1-containing lipid rafts. CD59 was expressed also on the IAM, but in a pronounced granular pattern with more variation observed from one spermatozoa to another. Both CD55 & CD59 were released from the IAM by PI-PLC, demonstrating them to be GPI-anchored. Analysis of acrosome-reacted spermatozoal CD55 by Western blotting revealed a novel single 55 kDa protein lacking significant oligosaccharides susceptible to glycosidases. Antibody-induced membrane rafting and release of CD55 & CD59 in vitro may have influenced previous results. Significant coexpression of CD55 & CD46 on the IAM suggests some functional cooperation at this site. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Acrosome | CD46 | CD55 | CD59 | Spermatozoa,25,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2006-07-01

Such signalling can involve the nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of signalling molecules, and to follow this, it is necessary to mark the cell and nuclear boundaries in an image sequence in individual cells. For complex processes, with both rapid cell motion and nuclear translocation, it is extremely time-consuming to mark such cell boundaries manually. The particle filter (PF) is a Monte Carlo method based on sequential importance sampling. It is robust to clutter and the occlusion of targets in object tracking. The active contour (AC) method is based on a deformable model and is capable of capturing minor cell shape variations, although a good initialisation is often required. Prior information from a particle filter provides a reasonable initialisation for the active contour method and prevents it from being trapped in local minima. Combining these two methods (PF-AC) thus makes it possible to track complex cellular processes automatically. The combined method is used to study the important NF-κB signalling pathway. Comparable results to those obtained manually by a biologist are obtained using the hyphenated approach, but in a small fraction of the time. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Here we show that the important cytokine TNF-α activates prolactin gene transcription in pituitary GH3 cells stably expressing luciferase under control of 5 kb of the human prolactin promoter. Similar regulation of the endogenous rat prolactin gene by TNF-α in GH3 cells was confirmed using real-time PCR. Luminescence microscopy revealed heterogeneous dynamic response patterns of promoter activity in individual cells. In GH3 cells treated with TNF-α, Western blot analysis showed rapid inhibitory protein κB (IκBα) degradation and phosphorylation of p65. Confocal microscopy of cells expressing fluorescence-labeled p65 and IκBα fusion proteins showed transient cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation and subsequent oscillations in p65 localization and confirmed IκBα degradation. This was associated with increased nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-mediated transcription from an NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter construct. Disruption of NF-κB signaling by expression of dominant-negative variants of IκB kinases or truncated IκBα abolished TNF-α activation of the prolactin promoter, suggesting that this effect was mediated by NF-κB. TNF-α signaling was found to interact with other endocrine signals to regulate prolactin gene expression and is likely to be a major paracrine modulator of lactotroph function.

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), it is known that the malignant cells secrete VEGF and possess VEGF receptors. This suggests that an autocrine loop might be important in the pathogenesis of CLL. Here we show that, in patients with lymphadenopathy, autocrine VEGF and α4β1 integrin are involved in the chemokine-dependent motility of CLL cells on and through endothelium-processes important for the invasion of lymphoreticular tissues, a major determinant of disease outcome. In contrast, normal lymphocytes were not dependent on autocrine VEGF or α4β1 for either type of cell movement. Moreover, in contrast to normal B lymphocytes, CLL cells failed to cluster and activate αLβ1 in response to chemokines, unless VEGF receptor(s) and α4β1 were also engaged by their respective ligands. This is the first demonstration that autocrine VEGF is involved in CLL-cell motility, and that the αLβ 2 on the malignant cells is functionally altered compared with that of normal B cells in not undergoing activation in response to chemokine alone. Given the importance of cell motility for tissue invasion, the present results provide a rationale for a trial of VEGF and α4 blockade in patients with CLL who have tissue disease. © 2005 by The American Society of Hematology.",,70,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2005-06-01

Targeting of cystatin C to the Golgi apparatus and processing through the secretory pathway of RPE cells are dependent upon a 26-amino acid signal sequence of precursor cystatin C. A variant with an alanine (A) to threonine (T) mutation in the penultimate amino acid of the signal sequence (A25T) was recently correlated with increased risk of developing exudative age-related macular degeneration. The biochemical consequence of the A25T mutation upon targeting of the protein is reported here. Targeting and trafficking of full-length mutant (A25T) precursor cystatin C-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein were studied in living, cultured retinal pigment epithelial and HeLa cells. Confocal microscopy studies were substantiated by immunodetection. In striking contrast to wild-type precursor cystatin C fusion protein conspicuously targeted to the Golgi apparatus, the threonine variant was associated principally with mitochondria. Some diffuse fluorescence was also observed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (but not nucleoli). Secretion of fusion protein derived from the threonine variant was reduced by approximately 50% compared with that of the wild-type cystatin C fusion protein. Expression of the variant fusion protein did not appear to impair expression or secretion of endogenous cystatin C.

In the present study, S100A1 was found to interact with another S100 protein, S100P, by using the yeast two-hybrid system. The binding parameters of the interaction were obtained using an optical biosensor and show that S100P has a slightly higher affinity for S100A1 (Kd = 10-20 nM) when compared with that for self-association (Kd = 40- 120 nM). The physical interaction of S100A1 and S100P was also demonstrated in living mammalian cells using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique. Preincubation of recombinant S100P with S100A1, before the biosensor assay, reduced by up to 50 % the binding of S100P to a recombinant C-terminal fragment of non-muscle myosin A, one of its target molecules. Site-specific mutations of S100P and S100A1, combined with homology modelling of an S100P/S100A1 heterodimer using known S100P and S100A1 structures, allowed the hydrophobic interactions at the dimeric interface of the heterodimer to be defined and provide an explanation for the heterodimerization of S100P and S100A1 at the molecular level.

However, the location of truncated APC is a function of cell density and in high-density cells truncated APC is predominantly not nuclear. Although the distribution of truncated APC and β-catenin is closely linked in subconfluent SW480 cells, at high cell density they are not colocalized. We postulated that in this cell line this could be due to an increase in β-catenin bound to E-cadherin with formation of adherens junctions at high cell density. However, while in coimmunoprecipitation assays we observe an increase in binding between β-catenin and E-cadherin and a corresponding decrease in binding between β-catenin and APC at high cell density, we did not observe a strict colocalization of β-catenin and E-cadherin at the membrane of all cells.",β-catenin | Adenomatous polyposis coli | Cell density | E-cadherin | Tumour progression,12,1,BBSRC,35141,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,0,2004-02-01

This proposed role has important implications for the complex host-parasite inter-relationship and also for the mode of action of several of the most effective antimalarial drugs. In addition, adaptive changes in the physiology of this organelle are implicated in drug resistance. Here we show that in addition to these functions, the digestive food vacuole of the malaria parasite is a dynamic internal store for free Ca2+, a role hitherto unsuspected. With the aid of live-cell laser scanning confocal imaging, spatiotemporal studies revealed that maintenance of elevated free Ca2+ in the digestive food vacuole (relative to cytosolic levels) is achieved by a thapsigargin (and cyclopiazonic acid)-sensitive Ca2+-pump in cooperation with a H+-dependent Ca2+ transporter. Redistribution of free cytosolic and vacuolar Ca2+ during parasite growth also suggests that vacuolar Ca2+ plays an essential role in parasite morphogenesis. These data imply that the digestive food vacuole of the malaria parasite is functionally akin to the vacuole of plants (tonoplast) and the small electron-dense granules of some parasites (acidocalcisomes) whereby H+-coupled Ca2+ transport is involved in ion transport, Ca2+ homeostasis, and signal transduction.

Proteins from other pathways are also known to regulate NF-κB negatively, notably the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and IL-4-responsive STAT6. Both pathways were shown to inhibit NF-κB-mediated transcription, by expressing either STAT6 or GR and activating the respective pathways. Using fluorescent fusion proteins, we show that GR alters the timing of activated p65 NF-κB nuclear occupancy by increasing the export rate of p65 and is independent of whether GR is present as a dimer or monomer. Expression of STAT6 was also shown to alter p65 nuclear occupancy but appeared to affect the import rate and hence the overall maximal level of p65 translocation. Activating STAT6 with IL-4 prior to activating NF-κB significantly increased this inhibition. Investigation of IκBα showed that activated STAT6 inhibited TNFα-mediated IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, whereas GR activation did not alter IκBα kinetics. This demonstrates a clear separation of two distinct mechanisms of inhibition by STAT6 and GR upon the NF-κB pathway.",Confocal microscopy | Fluorescent protein fusions | Glucocorticoid receptor | NF-κB | Signal transduction | STAT6,45,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2003-06-01

We have used the fluorescent mitochondrial indicators, JC-1, MitoTracker Red, and dihydrorhodamine 123 to show that live neutrophils possess a complex mitochondrial network that extends through the cytoplasm. The membrane potential of these mitochondria was rapidly (within 2 min) disrupted by the addition of FCCP (IC50 = 20 nM), but not by the Fo-ATPase inhibitor, oligomycin (at up to 7 μg/ml). However, inhibition of mitochondrial function with both agents resulted in cell shape changes. Neither activation of the respiratory burst nor phagocytosis of either latex particles or serum-opsonized Staphylococcus aureus was affected by the addition of FCCP or oligomycin. However, FCCP inhibited chemotaxis at concentrations that paralleled disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, prolonged (2-h) incubation with oligomycin resulted in an impaired ability to activate a respiratory burst and also inhibited chemotaxis. These observations indicate that intact mitochondrial function is required to sustain some neutrophil functions, but not for the rapid initiation of the respiratory burst or phagocytosis. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was a very early marker for commitment of neutrophils into apoptosis and preceded the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. However, inhibition of mitochondrial function did not accelerate the rate of neutrophil apoptosis. These data shed important insights into the hitherto unrecognized importance of mitochondria in the function of neutrophils during infection and inflammation.",,231,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2003-02-01

In cells treated consecutively with the two stimuli, the population response to the second stimulus was augmented. Single-cell analysis revealed that this was partly due to an increased number of cells responding, but also that the prevalence of response patterns changed: cells that responded to an initial stimulus were more likely to respond subsequently in a progressive sustained manner.

However, it is difficult to explain how axons continue to be populated with membrane proteins as they extend in length. To investigate this problem, we have used a CEPU-green fluorescent protein (GFP) chimeric protein to study the site of insertion of new glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins and their subsequent behaviour in chick dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Infection of cultures grown for 24 h revealed rapid expression of CEPU-GFP over the whole surface of the neuron, more rapidly than could be accounted for by diffusion from the growth cone, and fluorescence intensity was uniform along the length of the neurite. Photobleaching experiments of neurite membrane revealed that recovery of fluorescence was due to diffusion from adjacent membranes and there was no evidence for membrane flow in either direction. Photobleaching of membrane adjacent to the cell body also showed rapid recovery, with chimera diffusing both from cell body membrane and the distal neurite membrane into the bleached area. These results suggest there is no barrier to diffusion between the cell body and neurite membrane in DRG and sympathetic neurons cultured for 1 or 2 days in vitro. We propose that the neurite is populated by newly synthesised chimera by diffusion from both regions.

The purpose of the study was to determine whether vagal afferent neurons express OX-R1 and OX-R2 and whether orexin-A inhibits responses to CCK. Methods: OX-R1 and -R2 expression by rat and human nodose ganglia was examined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Receptor localization was determined by immunohistochemistry. Responses of rat jejunal afferent fibers were examined by electrophysiology. Results: Both rat and human nodose ganglia expressed OX-R1 as detected by RT-PCR, and humans also expressed OX-R2. The identity of the products was confirmed by sequencing. Immunohistochemistry indicated expression of OX-R1 in both species in neurons that also expressed CCKA and leptin receptors. In human ganglia there was also expression in glial cells that was absent in rats. Orexin-A had no effect on the resting discharge of afferent nerve fibers but inhibited responses to CCK.

Stimulation with TNFα leads to proteosomal degradation of the IκB proteins and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB proteins. Expression of p65 and IκBα fused to fluorescent proteins was used to measure the dynamics of these processes in transfected HeLa cells. Simultaneous visualisation of p65-dsRed translocation and IκBα-EGFP degradation indicated that in the presence of dual fluorescent fusion protein expression, the half-time of IκBα-EGFP degradation was reduced and that of p65 translocation was significantly increased when compared with cells expressing the single fluorescent fusion proteins. These results suggest that the ratio of IκBα and p65 determine the kinetics of transcription factor translocation into the nucleus and indicate that the complex of p65 and IκBα is the true substrate for TNFα stimulation in mammalian cells. When cells were treated with the CRM-1-dependent nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB), there was nuclear accumulation of IκBα-EGFP and p65-dsRed, with IκBα-EGFP accumulating more rapidly. No NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activation was seen in response to LMB treatment. Following 1 hour treatment with LMB, significant IκBα-EGFP nuclear accumulation, but low levels of p65-dsRed nuclear accumulation, was observed. When these cells were stimulated with TNFα, degradation of IκBα-EGFP was observed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. A normal transient transcription response was observed in the same cells using luminescence imaging of NF-κB-dependent transcription. These observations suggest that both normal activation and post-induction repression of NF-κB-dependent transcription occur even when nuclear export of NF-κB is inhibited. The results provide functional evidence that other factors, such as modification of p65 by phosphorylation, or interaction with other proteins such as transcriptional co-activators/co-repressors, may critically modulate the kinetics of transcription through this signalling pathway.",Confocal microscopy | Firefly luciferase | Fluorescent protein fusions | Luminescence imaging | NF-κB | Signal transduction,98,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2002-03-01

Immunochemical analysis of cell lysates confirmed the expression of a fusion protein recognized by antibodies to both cystatin C and EGFP. Cells transfected with the construct lacking the leader peptide of precursor cystatin C presented a diffuse and weak fluorescence. Together, these results imply a leader sequence-dependent processing of cystatin C through the secretory pathway of RPE cells. This was confirmed by the detection, by Western blotting, of the chimaeric protein alongside endogenous cystatin C in the medium of transfected RPE cells.",Cystatin C | EGFP-fusion protein | Golgi apparatus | Retinal pigment epithelium | Secretion,24,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2001-10-01

We have compared the efficacy of antisense oligonucleotides, which were selected in vitro using random combinatorial oligonucleotide libraries of differing length and complexity, upon putative target sites within TNFα mRNA. The relationship of specific target site accessibility and oligonucleotide efficacy with respect to these parameters proved to be complex. Modification of the length of the recognition sequence of the oligonucleotide library illustrated that independent target sites demonstrated a preference for antisense oligonucleotides of a defined and independent optimal length. The efficacy of antisense oligonucleotide sequences selected in vitro paralleled that observed in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated U937 cells. The application of methylphosphonate:phosphodiester chimaeric oligonucleotides to U937 cells reduced mRNA levels to up to 19.8% that of the untreated cell population.

We combined intracellular electrophysiological recording with fluorescein labeling of GSNs to determine their neuroanatomic and functional relationships with orexin neurons. Orexin A (1 μmol/1) caused a 500% increase (P < 0.01) in spontaneous firing rate and rapid and lasting depolarization that was tetrodotoxin-resistant and thus a direct postsynaptic effect. Orexin A altered the intrinsic neuronal properties of GSNs, consistent with increased excitability. Confocal microscopy showed that GSNs were intimately related to orexin neurons: orexin-immunoreactive axons were frequently entwined around GSN dendrites, establishing close and putatively synaptic contacts. Orexin-cell axons also passed in close proximity to glucose-responsive neurons, which are inhibited by low glucose, but orexin A caused smaller depolarization than on GSNs and only a 200% increase in spontaneous firing rate (P < 0.05 vs. GSN). We conclude that GSNs are specific target neurons for orexin A and suggest that they may mediate, at least in part, the acute appetite-stimulating effect of orexin A.

As yet no gene knockout mice have been engineered, and so there is little evidence to show that loss of Mcl-1 expression is sufficient to trigger apoptosis. U937 cells constitutively express the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2; but during differentiation, in response to the phorbol ester PMA (phorbol 12 β-myristate 13 α-acetate), Mcl-1 is transiently induced. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the functional role played by Mcl-1 in this differentiation program. Mcl-1 expression was specifically, disrupted by chimeric methylphosphonate/phosphodiester antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to just 5% of control levels. The depletion of Mcl-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was both rapid and specific, as indicated by the use of control oligodeoxynucleotides and analysis of the expression of other BCL2family members and PMA-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Specific depletion of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein, in the absence of changes in cellular levels of Bcl-2, results in a rapid entry into apoptosis. Levels of the proapoptotic protein Bax remained unchanged during differentiation, while Bak expression doubled within 24 hours. Apoptosis was detected within 4 hours of Mcl-1 antisense treatment by a variety of parameters including a novel live cell imaging technique allowing correlation of antisense treatment and apoptosis in individual cells. The induction of Mcl-1 is required to prevent apoptosis during differentiation of U937 cells, and the constitutive expression of Bcl-2 is unable to compensate for the loss of Mcl-1.

A central obstacle in the therapeutic application of ODN is their poor cellular uptake. Adding various lipophilic conjugates to the ODN backbone has been reported to improve uptake, and electroporation of target cells has also been shown to enhance intracellular ODN delivery. We have shown that (1) BCR-ABL-directed ODN will specifically decrease the level of BCR-ABL mRNA, provided that cells are first permeabilized with Streptolysin-O (SL-O), and (2) chimeric methylphosphonodiester:phosphodiester ODN directed against 9 bases either side of the BCR-ABL junction are more efficient ODN affectors than structures composed solely of phosphodiester or phosphorothioate linkages.

Several conjugated structures associated avidly with the cell membrane without achieving significant intracellular uptake or molecular effect. Similarly, ODN:Lipofectin complexes moderately increased cell association, without enhancing intracellular levels of ODN or inducing detectable molecular effect. In SL-O permeabilized or electroporated cells, uptake was approximately 1 to 2 logs greater than in untreated cells, and rapid nuclear localization was seen, especially with unmodified chimeric ODN. In SL-O permeabilized cells treated with ODN directed to the b2a2 and b3a2 junctions respectively, b2a2 BCR-ABL mRNA levels at 4 hours were reduced to 2.6% ± 2.1% and 38.4% ± 1.3% of control values. In cells permeabilized by electroporation, BCR-ABL mRNA levels were decreased to 4.0% ± 1.4% of control levels by b2a2 directed ODN, although very little nontargeted suppression was seen with b3a2-targeted ODN (93.4% ± 4.2% of control). Greater cell to cell variation in ODN uptake was seen for SL-O permeabilized cells when compared with electroporated cells, suggesting that, after SL-O permeabilization, relatively unpermeabilized and overpermeabilized populations may coexist. No structure had any effect on the level of irrelevant (p53, MYC, and GADPH) mRNA levels. We conclude that the conjugation of chimetic ODN with one of the above-mentioned lipophilic groups or the complexing of ODN with Lipofectin does not improve either intracellular delivery of ODN or the molecular effect. In contrast, both electroporation and SL-O permeabilization (1) considerably enhanced uptake of chimetic ODN (even for structures without a conjugate group) and (2) achieved significant suppression of target mRNA levels.",,84,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,1998-06-01

Oligonucleotides are not readily transfected into leukaemia cell lines using cationic lipid systems and streptolysin O (SLO) is used to effect their delivery. We wished to investigate the optimal oligonucleotide composition for antisense efficacy and specificity following delivery into leukaemia cells using SLO. For this study the well characterised chronic myeloid leukaemia cell line KYO-1 was selected and oligonucleotides (20mers) were targeted to an empirically identified accessible site of c-myc mRNA. The efficiency and specificity of antisense effect was measured 4 and 24 h after SLO-mediated delivery of the oligonucleotides. C5-propyne phosphodiester and phosphorothioate compounds were found to present substantial non-specific effects at 20 μM but were inactive at 0.2 μM. Indeed, no antisense-specific effect was noted at any concentration at either time. All of the other oligonucleotides tested induced some measurable antisense effect, except 7 (chimeric, all-phosphorothioate, 2'-methoxyethoxy termini) which was essentially inactive at 20 μM. The rank efficiency order of the remaining antisense compounds was 4 = 3 >> 9 >> 10 = 8 = 5 = 6 > 11. The efficient antisense effects induced by the chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiester compounds were found to be highly specific. Increased phosphorothioate content in the oligonucleotide backbone correlated with reduced antisense activity (efficacy: 2'-methoxyethoxy series 9 >> 8 >> 7, 2'-methoxytriethoxy series 10 > 11). No consistent evidence was obtained for increased activity correlating with increased oligonucleotide-mRNA heteroduplex thermal stability. In conclusion, the chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides present the most favourable characteristics of the compounds tested, for efficient and specific antisense suppression of gene expression following SLO-mediated delivery.",,70,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,1998-04-01

The majority of the antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were designed to be capable of directing ribonuclease H (RNase H) cleavage of their target mRNAs. Streptolysin O (SLO) reversible permeabilization was used to deliver the oligodeoxynucleotides into the CML line KYO-1. We found that the efficiency and specificity of antisense oligonucleotide-induced reductions of target protein expression depended on target protein half-life, the oligonucleotide structure, and the specific sequence within the target mRNA. Transient reductions of c-myc mRNA and protein were achieved with a chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to the initiation codon, but cell proliferation was unaffected. In contrast, a chimeric oligodeoxynucleotide of similar structure targeted to an alternative site in the coding region of c-myc mRNA reduced target mRNA and protein levels for over 24 hours and halted cell proliferation. Chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to a point mutation in KYO-1 p53 mRNA efficiently reduced target mRNA expression, but only small, transient reductions in p53 protein expression were observed. However, a chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide targeted to the same site reduced p53 protein to 30% of control levels over a 48-hour period.

They may therefore have clinical potential for purging harvests from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients, prior to autografting. Whilst ODN are highly effective in cell-free systems, their uptake into intact cells is very poor. We have previously reported that reversible permeabilisation of CML cell lines with Streptolysin-O (SL-O) can dramatically increase intracytoplasmic and nuclear ODN uptake. In this study, we examined whether SL-O permeabilisation could be used to enhance ODN uptake into bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests from CML patients, without undue toxicity. All 19 harvests studied were from patients in stable chronic phase of CML. Samples studied were either fresh BM harvests following leucoconcentration, fresh PBSC collections, or from previously cryopreserved harvests. Cells were permeabilised by SL-O to load them with fluorescein-labelled ODN. The proportion of permeabilised and viable cells was assessed by fluorescein uptake and propidium iodide exclusion, respectively, by flow cytometry. The effect of SL-O on ODN uptake and cell toxicity was unpredictable on simple mononuclear fractions of harvests. In contrast, SL-O consistently significantly enhanced ODN uptake in samples which were first selected for CD34-positive cells, and this was achieved without either direct toxicity or inhibition of CFU-GM growth. The SL-O concentration required for optimal permeabilisation varied considerably from case to case, in line with previous data on cell lines. PBSC harvests positively selected for CD34-positive cells tended to achieve superior permeabilisation to CD34 positively selected BM harvests. SL-O can be used to safely enhance the intracellular uptake of antisense ODN. This is best achieved on harvests which are first selected for CD34-positive cells.",Antisense gene therapy | Chronic myeloid leukaemia | Streptolysin-O,19,1,NWCR,undefined,North West Cancer Research Fund,papers by authors,0,1997-01-01

On the other hand, oligonucleotides introduced directly into the cytoplasm by microinjection rapidly accumulate in the cell nucleus. Poor delivery to the designated site of action of antisense oligonucleotides is a major problem limiting their routine use in genetic research and their development as potential therapeutic agents. In view of this difficulty, various means of membrane permeabilization were applied to cultured human leukemia cells in an attempt to enhance intracytoplasmic delivery of fluorescein-tagged oligodeoxynucleotides. The outcome of the manipulations was monitored by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. This work has directly confirmed the conclusion suggested by reported antisense effects, that streptolysin O reversibly permeabilizes the plasma membrane toward oligonucleotides and may be utilized to effect biochemical “microinjection” of these molecules directly into the cytoplasm. KY01 myelogenous leukemia cells treated in this way accumulated over 100-fold higher intracellular levels of oligodeoxynucleotides than in the absence of streptolysin O and, in contrast to the latter case, were observed to concentrate internalized molecules in their nuclei. © 1995, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

In this report, we extend our previous observations to show that phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides also direct substantial inappropriate RNase H-mediated hydrolysis of non-targeted RNA. Chimeric methylphosphonodiester/phosphodiesters were found to be capable of efficiently directing RNase H when the central phosphodiester section was reduced to just two contiguous internucleoside linkages. Furthermore, cleavage of non-target RNA sites was found to be undetectable, or minimal in extent, when RNase H was directed by such chimeras. In addition, we show that analogue structures which contain three, or fewer, phosphodiester residues in otherwise methylphosphonodiester molecules were imported into cells via the comparatively more efficient route taken by methylphosphonates, rather than by receptor-mediated endocytosis, which is generally characteristic for polyanionic structures. Evidence is presented that the primary process responsible for enhanced uptake is an active mechanism. Nevertheless, a proportion of the applied oligodeoxynucleotide analogues, which demonstrate augmented uptake, appear to have penetrated into the cytoplasmic cellular compartment. The present results suggest that chimeric molecules of the type we describe here may show considerable utility as antisense effectors due to their increased cellular import, access to the intracellular compartments, and their highly efficient and specific direction of RNase H.",,62,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,1993-01-01

It is therefore important to develop objective methods of assessing the cervical state to understand how cervical softening is regulated. The extensibility (creep) of standard sized strips of ovine cervical tissue was measured in vitro using a creep testing device. There was a three-fold increase in the extensibility of the tissue taken from ewes during labor compared to saline treated controls (P < 0.05). Infusion of estradiol-17β (E2β) for 18 h commencing on day 145 of gestation caused a marked increase in extensibility of the tissue (P < 0.05). Increase in extensibility was associated with a rise in PGFM and fall in plasma progesterone. Sodium meclofenamate (MFA) infused simultaneously with E2β, blocked the E2β induced softening of the cervix despite the low plasma progesterone levels. Similarly cervices from sheep receiving MFA alone had low extensibility. E2β-induced softening of the ovine cervix appears to be modulated in part by prostaglandins. © 1992.",,5,0,WT,undefined,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0,1992-01-01

These include enhanced biological stability relative to all-phosphodiester molecules, increased activity in directing ribonuclease H mediated destruction of target RNA, increased specificity and reduced non-specific toxicity. However, another important parameter, the ability of these molecules to enter intact mammalian cells, has not previously been investigated. Therefore, oligodeoxynucleotides were tagged at their 5'-termini with fluorescein reporter groups and a detailed study of uptake kinetics in human leukaemia MOLT-4 cells undertaken by calibrated flow cytometry. Baseline measurements with all-phosphodiester and all-methylphosphonate molecules confirmed that uptake of oligodeoxynucleotides by intact cells is a highly inefficient process. The kinetic data were in agreement with previous reports of mechanisms of cell uptake involving receptor mediated endocytosis in the case of phosphodiester molecules and simple diffusion for methylphosphonates. Chimeric oligodeoxynucleotides exhibited saturable cell uptake kinetics similar to all-phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotides, suggesting that uptake was receptor-mediated and distinct from concentration-dependent uptake of all-methylphosphonate molecules. Similarly, chimeric molecules were apparently confined to the endosomal compartment within cells. These results imply that reversible masking of the negative charges of the phosphodiester sections of chimeric oligodeoxynucleotides may be required to change the uptake mechanism back to simple diffusion and allow intracellular delivery to the site of the target RNA.",,40,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,1992-01-01

To create surrogate spherical targets of defined stiffness, sodium alginate was used to synthesise soft (9 kPa), medium (34 kPa) or stiff (254 kPa) cell-sized beads, coated with antibodies against activating receptor NKp30 (also known as NCR3) and the integrin LFA-1 (also known as ITGAL). Against stiff beads, NK cells showed increased degranulation.

We believe that our theoretical results may resolve the apparent paradox of how a system like NF-κB that regulates cell fate and inflammatory signalling in response to diverse stimuli can appear to have the low information carrying capacity suggested by recent studies on scalar signals. In carrying out our study, we introduce new methods for the analysis of large, nonlinear stochastic dynamic models, and develop computational algorithms that facilitate the calculation of fundamental constructs of information theory such as Kullback–Leibler divergences and sensitivity matrices, and link these methods to a new theory about multiplexing information.

Many aspects of the physiology of the intervertebral disc (IVD) show clear diurnal rhythms. However, it is unknown whether IVD tissue contains functional circadian clocks and if so, how their dysregulation is implicated in IVD degeneration. Methods Clock gene dynamics in ex vivo IVD explants (from PER2:: luciferase (LUC) reporter mice) and human disc cells (transduced with lentivirus containing Per2::luc reporters) were monitored in real time by bioluminescence photon counting and imaging. Temporal gene expression changes were studied by RNAseq and quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR. IVD pathology was evaluated by histology in a mouse model with tissue-specific deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1. Results Here we show the existence of the circadian rhythm in mouse IVD tissue and human disc cells. This rhythm is dampened with ageing in mice and can be abolished by treatment with interleukin-1β but not tumour necrosis factor α. Time-series RNAseq revealed 607 genes with 24-hour patterns of expression representing several essential pathways in IVD physiology. Mice with conditional knockout of Bmal1 in their disc cells demonstrated age-related degeneration of IVDs. Conclusions We have established autonomous circadian clocks in mouse and human IVD cells which respond to age and cytokines, and control key pathways involved in the homeostasis of IVDs. Genetic disruption to the mouse IVD molecular clock predisposes to IVD degeneration. These results support the concept that disruptions to circadian rhythms may be a risk factor for degenerative IVD disease and low back pain.",Arthritis | Chondrocytes | Cytokines | Low Back Pain,60,1,WT,088785/Z/09/Z,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0,2017-03-01

However, apparent discordance among these data has hampered their full utility toward advancing mechanistic and therapeutic knowledge. To collectively reconcile these datasets, we performed a meta-analysis of data from eight published RNAi screens and integrated these data with three protein interaction datasets, including one generated within the context of this study. Further integration of these data with global virus-host interaction analyses revealed a functionally validated biochemical landscape of the influenza-host interface, which can be queried through a simplified and customizable web portal (http://www.metascape.org/IAV). Follow-up studies revealed that the putative ubiquitin ligase UBR4 associates with the viral M2 protein and promotes apical transport of viral proteins. Taken together, the integrative analysis of influenza OMICs datasets illuminates a viral-host network of high-confidence human proteins that are essential for influenza A virus replication.",,547,1,NIH,R35CA197717,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2015-12-01

However, as these networks and resulting mathematical models are inherently complex and non-linear, the understanding of this relationship becomes challenging. Among many approaches, model reduction methods provide an avenue to extract components responsible for the key dynamical features of the system. Unfortunately, these approaches often require intuition to apply. In this manuscript we propose a practical algorithm for the reduction of biochemical reaction systems using fast-slow asymptotics. This method allows the ranking of system variables according to how quickly they approach their momentary steady state, thus selecting the fastest for a steady state approximation. We applied this method to derive models of the Nuclear Factor kappa B network, a key regulator of the immune response that exhibits oscillatory dynamics. Analyses with respect to two specific solutions, which corresponded to different experimental conditions identified different components of the system that were responsible for the respective dynamics. This is an important demonstration of how reduction methods that provide approximations around a specific steady state, could be utilised in order to gain a better understanding of network topology in a broader context.",Characteristic timescales | Model reduction | Nuclear Factor kappa B | Signalling networks,12,1,BBSRC,BB/F005938/1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,1,2015-02-01

Methods: Ex vivo cartilage explants were isolated from the Cry1-luc or PER2::LUC clock reporter mice. Clock gene dynamics were monitored in real-time by bioluminescence photon counting. Gene expression changes were studied by qRT-PCR. Functional luc assays were used to study the function of the core Clock/BMAL1 complex in SW-1353 cells. NFkB pathway inhibitor and fluorescence live-imaging of cartilage were performed to study the underlying mechanisms. Results: Exposure to IL-1β severely disrupted circadian gene expression rhythms in cartilage. This effect was reversed by an anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone, but not by other clock synchronizing agents. Circadian disruption mediated by IL-1β was accompanied by disregulated expression of endogenous clock genes and clock-controlled catabolic pathways. Mechanistically, NFkB signalling was involved in the effect of IL-1β on the cartilage clock in part through functional interference with the core Clock/BMAL1 complex. In contrast, TNFα had little impact on the circadian rhythm and clock gene expression in cartilage. Conclusion: In our experimental system (young healthy mouse cartilage), we demonstrate that IL-1β (but not TNFα) abolishes circadian rhythms in Cry1-luc and PER2::LUC gene expression. These data implicate disruption of the chondrocyte clock as a novel aspect of the catabolic responses of cartilage to pro-inflammatory cytokines, and provide an additional mechanism for how chronic joint inflammation may contribute to osteoarthritis (OA).",Cartilage | Circadian clock | Cytokine | Inflammation | Osteoarthritis,51,1,FP7,FP7/305564,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,0,2015-01-01

This stochastic switch model provides a generic framework to capture many different dynamic features observed in single cell gene expression. Inference for such SRNs is challenging due to the intractability of the transition densities. We derive a model-specific birth-death approximation and study its use for inference in comparison with the linear noise approximation where both approximations are considered within the unifying framework of state-space models.

However, one would not only like to infer kinetic parameters but also study their variability from cell to cell. Here we focus on the case where single-cell fluorescent protein imaging time series data are available for a population of cells. Based on van Kampen's linear noise approximation, we derive a dynamic state space model for molecular populations which is then extended to a hierarchical model. This model has potential to address the sources of variability relevant to single-cell data, namely, intrinsic noise due to the stochastic nature of the birth and death processes involved in reactions and extrinsic noise arising from the cell-to-cell variation of kinetic parameters. In order to infer such a model from experimental data, one must also quantify the measurement process where one has to allow for nonmeasurable molecular species as well as measurement noise of unknown level and variance. The availability of multiple single-cell time series data here provides a unique testbed to fit such a model and quantify these different sources of variation from experimental data. © Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2013.",Bayesian hierarchical modeling | Intrinsic and extrinsic noise | Kinetic parameter estimation | Linear noise approximation | State space model and Kalman filter,22,1,BBSRC,BB/F005814/1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,1,2013-12-01

The presence of this stochastic or 'noisy' expression pattern has been relatively unexplored in tissue systems. The prolactin gene provides a model of tissue-specific gene regulation resulting in pulsatile transcription dynamics in both cell lines and endocrine tissues. In most cell culture models, prolactin transcription appears to be highly variable between cells, with differences in transcription pulse duration and frequency. This apparently stochastic transcription is constrained by a transcriptional refractory period, which may be related to cycles of chromatin remodelling. We propose that prolactin transcription dynamics result from the summation of oscillatory cellular inputs and by regulation through chromatin remodelling cycles. Observations of transcription dynamics in cells within pituitary tissue show reduced transcriptional heterogeneity and can be grouped into a small number of distinct patterns. Thus, it appears that the tissue environment is able to reduce transcriptional noise to enable coordinated tissue responses to environmental change. We review the current knowledge on the complex tissue-specific regulation of the prolactin gene in pituitary and extra-pituitary sites, highlighting differences between humans and rodent experimental animal models. Within this context, we describe the transcription dynamics of prolactin gene expression and how this may relate to specific processes occurring within the cell. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Chromatin | Dynamics | Pituitary | Prolactin | Transcription,27,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2012-07-01

Due to the lack of adequate experimental models, the function of locally produced PRL in the immune system is largely unknown. Using transgenic rats that express luciferase under the control of extensive human PRL regulatory regions, we characterized immune cell responses to thioglycollate (TG)-induced peritonitis. Resident populations of myeloid cells in the peritoneal cavity of untreated rats expressed barely detectable levels of luciferase. In contrast, during TG-induced peritonitis, cell-specific expression in both neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages in peritoneal exudates increased dramatically. Elevated luciferase expression was also detectable in peripheral blood and bone marrow CD11b +cells. Ex vivo stimulation of primary myeloid cells showed activation of the human extrapituitary promoter by TNF-α, lipopolysaccharide, or TG. These findings were confirmed in human peripheral blood monocytes, showing that the transgenic rat provided a faithful model for the human gene. Thus, the resolution of an inflammatory response is associated with dramatic activation of the PRL gene promoter in the myeloid lineage.

But the intensity of the TNFα signal varies substantially, from picomolar in the blood plasma of healthy organisms to nanomolar in diseased states. We report on a systematic survey using computational bifurcation theory to explore the relationship between the intensity of TNFα stimulation and the existence of sustained NF-κB oscillations. Using a deterministic model developed by Ashall et al. in 2009, we find that the system's responses to TNFα are characterised by a supercritical Hopf bifurcation point: above a critical intensity of TNFα the system exhibits sustained oscillations in NF-kB localisation. For TNFα below this critical value, damped oscillations are observed. This picture depends, however, on the values of the model's other parameters. When the values of certain reaction rates are altered the response of the signalling pathway to TNFα stimulation changes: in addition to the sustained oscillations induced by high-dose stimulation, a second oscillatory regime appears at much lower doses. Finally, we define scores to quantify the sensitivity of the dynamics of the system to variation in its parameters and use these scores to establish that the qualitative dynamics are most sensitive to the details of NF-κB mediated gene transcription. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Bifurcation analysis | NF-κB signalling pathway | Oscillations | Parameter sensitivity,22,1,MRC,G0500346,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2012-03-01

PERP (p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22), a p53 transcriptional target, is induced specifically during apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest. Downregulation of PERP is associated with the aggressive, monosomy 3-type of uveal melanoma (UM), the most common primary intraocular tumour in adults, and increased PERP expression has a pro-apoptotic effect in UM cells. Here, we identify a novel effect of PERP expression, as elevated PERP protein positively influences active levels of its own transcriptional regulator, p53. Using fluorescent fusion proteins of PERP, p53 and MDM2, we demonstrate in single living UM cells that PERP expression significantly enhances p53 activity and its nuclear localization, increases p53-dependent transcription (including that of MDM2) while allowing oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of p53/ MDM2 complexes. Phosphorylation of p53 serine residues that interfere with the interaction between p53 and its negative regulator MDM2 and enhance pro-apoptotic gene transcription also occurs subsequent to PERP expression. These results implicate a role for PERP in amplifying functional p53 levels that promote p53-dependent apoptosis, and reveal a potential target for exploitation in enhancing p53 activity. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Apoptosis | Fluorescent protein | P53 | PERP | Uveal melanoma,25,1,BBSRC,BB/E012965/1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,1,2011-03-01

Although the mechanism has not yet been elucidated fully, a core system has been identified consisting of a negative feedback loop involving NF-kappa B (RelA:p50 hetero-dimer) and its inhibitor I-kappa B-alpha. Many authors have suggested that this core oscillator should couple to other oscillatory pathways.Results: First we analyse single-cell data from experiments in which the NF-kappa B system is forced by short trains of strong pulses of TNF-alpha. Power spectra of the ratio of nuclear-to-cytoplasmic concentration of NF-kappa B suggest that the cells' responses are entrained by the pulsing frequency. Using a recent model of the NF-kappa B system due to Caroline Horton, we carried out extensive numerical simulations to analyze the response frequencies induced by trains of pulses of TNF-alpha stimulation having a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes. These studies suggest that for sufficiently weak stimulation, various nonlinear resonances should be observable. To explore further the possibility of probing alternative feedback mechanisms, we also coupled the model to sinusoidal signals with a wide range of strengths and frequencies. Our results show that, at least in simulation, frequencies other than those of the forcing and the main NF-kappa B oscillator can be excited via sub- and superharmonic resonance, producing quasiperiodic and even chaotic dynamics.Conclusions: Our numerical results suggest that the entrainment phenomena observed in pulse-stimulated experiments is a consequence of the high intensity of the stimulation. Computational studies based on current models suggest that resonant interactions between periodic pulsatile forcing and the system's natural frequencies may become evident for sufficiently weak stimulation. Further simulations suggest that the nonlinearities of the NF-kappa B feedback oscillator mean that even sinusoidally modulated forcing can induce a rich variety of nonlinear interactions. © 2011 Wang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,31,1,MRC,BBF005381,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,2,2011-02-01

Its activation results in oscillations in nuclear NF-κB abundance. We treated cells with repeated short pulses of TNFα (tumour necrosis factor α) at various intervals to mimic pulsatile inflammatory signals. At all pulse intervals analysed, we observed synchronous cycles of NF-κB nuclear translocation. Lower frequency stimulations gave repeated full-amplitude translocations, whereas higher frequency pulses gave translocations with reduced amplitude, indicating that the system failed to reset completely. Deterministic and stochastic mathematical models predicted how negative feedback loops might regulate both system resetting and cellular heterogeneity. Altering the stimulation interval gave different patterns of NF-κB-dependent gene expression, supporting a functional role for oscillation frequency. The causes of cell-to-cell variation and the possible functions of these processes in cells and tissues are discussed. The NF-κB system is just one of a number of known biological oscillators that include calcium signalling, transcription cycles, p53, the segmentation clock, the circadian clock, the cell cycle and seasonal rhythms. The way such cycles are integrated could be part of the answer as to how organisms achieve complexity while retaining the robustness of cellular decision-making processes. ©The Authors.",Gene expression regulation | Inflammatory response | Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) | Oscillation | Phosphorylation | Single-cell imaging,5,0,MRC,G0500346,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2010-10-01

However, owing to the complexity of signalling networks, these non-linear systems can easily elude human intuition. The central aim of systems biology is to improve our understanding of the temporal complexity of cell signalling pathways, using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. Live-cell imaging and computational modelling are compatible techniques which allow quantitative analysis of cell signalling pathway dynamics. Non-invasive imaging techniques, based on the use of various luciferases and fluorescent proteins, trace cellular events such as gene expression, protein-protein interactions and protein localization in cells. By employing a number of markers in a single assay, multiple parameters can be measured simultaneously in the same cell. Following acquisition using specialized microscopy, analysis of multi-parameter time-lapse images facilitates the identification of important qualitative and quantitative relationships-linking intracellular signalling, gene expression and cell fate. Improvements in reporter genes coupled with significant advances in detector technologies are now allowing us to image gene expression non-invasively in individual living cells. These methods are providing remarkable insights into the dynamics of gene expression during complex processes, such as the cell cycle and the responses of cells to hormones, growth factors and nutrients. On a larger scale, dynamics of gene expression may also be monitored in living organisms. This new technology will greatly assist attempts to decipher the complex behaviours exhibited by biological signalling networks, for instance the ability to integrate multiple input signals over time, and generate specific outputs. © The Authors Journal compilation. © 2008 Biochemical Society.",,18,0,MRC,G0500346,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2008-12-01

Exocytosis in somatic cells is a rapid process - typically complete within milliseconds - yet acrosomal enzymes are required throughout zona penetration - a period of minutes. Here, we present the first studies of this crucial and complex event occurring in real-time in individual live sperm using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Simultaneous imaging of separate probes for acrosomal content and inner acrosomal membrane show that rapid membrane fusion, initiated at the cell apex, is followed by exceptionally slow dispersal of acrosomal content (up to 12 minutes). Cells that lose their acrosome prematurely (spontaneous AR), compromising their ability to penetrate the egg vestments, are those that are already subject to a loss of motility and viability.

We found that estradiol induced a reproducible 1.8-fold activation of the hPrl gene promoter, using pituitary GH3 cells stably transfected with a 5000-bp hPrl promoter fragment linked to luciferase reporter gene. This activation was blocked by treatment with estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists 4-hydroxytamoxifen and ICI-182,780. Promoter deletion and mutagenesis experiments identified a functional estrogen response element (ERE) sequence 1189 bp upstream of the transcription start site that was responsible for estrogen-mediated promoter activation. This site differed from the consensus ERE sequence by two base pairs, one in each half-site. This ERE was identified to be functional through binding ERα in EMSAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed ERα binding to this sequence in vivo in the absence of ligand, with increased recruitment when cells were cultured in the presence of estradiol. When cells were treated with both estradiol and TNFα, we observed synergistic activation of the hPrl promoter, which was mediated by the - 1189-bp ERE. Mutagenesis of this ERE abolished the promoter-activating effect not only of estradiol but also of TNFα. These data suggest a novel, promoter-specific signaling interaction between estrogen and TNFα signaling, which is likely to be important for prolactin regulation in vivo.

The effect of cell shape on mitogen-evoked Ca2+ signaling events that accompany entry into the cell cycle was investigated. In unrestricted cells, the mitogens bombesin and fetal calf serum evoked a typical biphasic change in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration. However, when the spreading of individual cells was restricted, such that progression to S phase was substantially reduced, both bombesin and fetal calf serum caused a rapid transient rise in the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration but failed to elicit the normal sustained influx of Ca2+ that follows Ca 2+release. As expected, restricting cell spreading led to the loss of actin stress fibers and the formation of a ring of cortical actin. Restricting cell shape did not appear to influence mitogen-receptor interactions, nor did it influence the presence of focal adhesions. Because Ca2+ signaling is an essential component of mitogen responses, these findings implicate Ca 2+ influx as a necessary component of cell shape-dependent control of the cell cycle. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,11,1,BBSRC,BB/E012965/1,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,0,2007-11-01

We have identified previously topoisomerase II and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) as part of a complex. In this paper we demonstrate that drug combinations targeting these two enzymes cause a synergistic increase in apoptosis. The objective of our study was to identify the mode of cell killing and the mechanism behind the increase in topoisomerase II mediated DNA damage. Importantly we demonstrate that Hsp90 inhibition results in an increased topoiosmerase II activity but not degradation of topoisomerase II and it is this, in the presence of a topoisomerase II poison that causes the increase in cell death. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of action where the inhibition of Hsp90 disrupts the Hsp90-topoisomerase II interaction leading to an increase in and activation of unbound topoisomerase II, which, in the presence of a topoisomerase II poison leads to the formation of an increased number of cleavable complexes ultimately resulting in rise in DNA damage and a subsequent increase cell death. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,33,1,NWCR,2578,North West Cancer Research Fund,papers by authors,0,2006-03-01

The model displayed oscillations that varied both in number, amplitude and frequency when its parameters were varied. Sensitivity analysis showed that just nine of the 64 reaction parameters were mainly responsible for the control of the oscillations when these parameters were varied individually. However, the control of the properties of any complex system is distributed, and, as many of these reactions are highly non-linear, we expect that their interactions will be too. Pairwise modulation of these nine parameters gives a search space some 50 times smaller (81 against 4096) than that required for the pairwise modulation of all 64 reactions, and this permitted their study (which would otherwise have been effectively intractable). Strikingly synergistic effects were observed, in which the effect of one of the parameters was strongly (and even qualitatively) dependent on the values of another parameter. Regions of parameter, space could be found in which the amplitude, but not the frequency (timing), of oscillations varied, and vice versa. Such modelling will permit the design and performance of experiments aimed at disentangling the role of the dynamics of oscillations, rather than simply their amplitude, in determining cell fate. Overall, the analyses reveal a level of complexity in these dynamic models that is not apparent from study of their individual parameters alone and point to the value of manipulating multiple elements of complex networks to achieve desired physiological effects. © IEE, 2005.",,45,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2005-09-01

Here, we tested the hypothesis that individual lactotroph cells exhibit a heterogeneous response to changes in photoperiod, by exploiting a recently developed assay for prolactin gene expression in single pars distalis (PD) cells. Male Syrian hamsters were exposed to either long (LD; 16h light: 8h dark) or short (SD; 8h light: 16h dark) photoperiods for 12 weeks. Response of the lactotrophic axis to photoperiod was confirmed by the significantly (P<0.01) lower plasma prolactin concentrations in SD than LD hamsters. Analysis of freshly dispersed PD cells by in situ hybridisation demonstrated that photoperiod has no effect (P>0.05) on the proportion of PD cells (approximately 25%) that expressed prolactin mRNA. Heterogeneity of prolactin mRNA expression was observed in both LD and SD. A similar proportion of cells expressed low levels of prolactin mRNA in both photoperiods, suggesting that they may be unresponsive to photoperiod change. In contrast, the remaining PD cells that expressed prolactin mRNA exhibited markedly increased gene expression in LD, consistent with the selective recruitment of a lactotroph subpopulation to a more transcriptionally active state in this photoperiod. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This vector was used to infect the pituitary GH3 cell line, and also primary cultures of Syrian hamster pituitary cells. We show that adenovirally transduced cells retained normal regulation of the promoter-reporter transgene by appropriate signals. Furthermore, microscopic imaging studies indicated that both clonal and primary pituitary cells were transduced efficiently, giving readily detectable luminescence signals in real-time over long periods. Finally, analysis of single-cell expression patterns indicated that prolactin promoter activity was highly dynamic with pulses in gene expression, revealing that the transcriptional instability seen in clonal cells is a feature of normal pituitary cells.

Prolonged exposure to short winter day lengths results in refractoriness, a spontaneous reversion to long-day physiological status. Despite its critical role in the timing of seasonal rhythms, refractoriness remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was therefore to describe cellular and molecular mechanisms driving the seasonal secretion of a key hormone, prolactin, in refractory Syrian hamsters. We used recently developed single cell hybridization and reporter assays to show that this process is initiated by timed reactivation of endocrine signaling from the pars tuberalis (PT) region of the pituitary gland, a well-defined melatonin target site, causing renewed activation of prolactin gene expression. This timed signaling is independent of per1 clock gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei and PT and of melatonin secretion, which continue to track day length. Within the PT, there is also a continued short day-like profile of ICER expression, suggesting that the change in hormone secretion is independent of cAMP signaling. Our data thus identify the PT as a key anatomical structure involved in endogenous seasonal timing mechanisms, which breaks from prevailing day length-induced gene expression.",Circadian | Clock gene | Melatonin | Pars tuberalis | Photoperiod | Refractoriness,46,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2003-05-01

A high degree of sequence identity was found between this and other putative crustacean FAMTases. Conceptual translation and protein sequence analysis suggested that phosphorylation could occur at multiple sites in the FAMTase. This finding is consistent with the recent observation that endogenous FAMTase activity in mandibular organ extracts can be regulated by phosphorylation in vitro. We demonstrated that the recombinant FAMTase could be expressed as a LacZ-fusion protein in Escherichia coli and have undertaken its partial purification from inclusion bodies. In an established assay system, the recombinant FAMTase lacked activity. Northern blotting demonstrated widespread expression of an approximately 1250-nucleotide FAMTase transcript in female C. pagurus tissues. Levels of FAMTase transcripts in mandibular organs of female C. pagurus were found to fluctuate during vitellogenesis and embryonic development.

However, G-17 also stimulated the migration of cells expressing green fluorescent protein, but not the receptor, when they were co-cultured with receptor-expressing cells consistent with activation of paracrine signals. The use of various pharmacological inhibitors indicated that gastrin stimulated migration via activation of the EGF receptor (EGR-R), the erbB-2 receptor tyrosine kinase, and the MAP kinase pathway.

The aim of this study was to analyse the nature of the photoperiodic regulation of prolactin gene expression, and to define the role of melatonin and the pars tuberalis of the anterior pituitary in this process. Pituitary prolactin gene expression, restricted to the pars distalis, was increased in hamsters maintained in long daylengths (16 h:8 h, light: dark) compared to hamsters exposed to short daylengths (8 h:16 h, light:dark) for 8-12 weeks. Analysis of single cells by in situ hybridization showed that photoperiod had no effect on the percentage of pars distalis cells expressing prolactin mRNA, but shifted the frequency distribution of prolactin mRNA expression per cell, such that in long photoperiods a greater proportion of cells were recruited to a higher expressing population. In vitro coculture of hamster pars tuberalis fragments increased prolactin promoter-driven luciferase activity in stably transfected GH3 cells in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. Conditioned medium from hamster and ovine pars tuberalis also activated the prolactin promoter. Furthermore, basal and forskolin-stimulated conditioned medium from hamster pars tuberalis increased prolactin mRNA expression in primary cultures of pars distalis cells. Melatonin attenuated the activity of pars tuberalis-conditioned medium but had no direct effect on either prolactin mRNA expression or secretion in pars distalis cell cultures. Finally, pars tuberalis fragments from long photoperiod hamsters stimulated prolactin gene promoter activity to a greater extent than those from short photoperiod hamsters. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence in a seasonal mammal that the synthesis of prolactin depends on photoperiodic modulation of a pars tuberalis-derived factor. Our data support further the hypothesis that seasonal modulation of prolactin gene expression depends upon a melatonin-dependent paracrine action of the pars tuberalis on pars distalis lactotrophic cells.",Hamster | Pars tuberalis | Photoperiod | Pituitary | Prolactin,57,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2001-01-01

We have investigated the long-term timing of transcriptional activation from the PRL, GH, and cytomegalovirus promoters in response to different stimulus duration, using real-time imaging of luciferase expression in living stably transfected GH3 cells. Long-term stimulation of serum-starved cells with 50% serum induced a homogeneous rise in PRL promoter activity, with subsequent heterogeneous fluctuations in luciferase activity in individual cells. When cells were subjected to a 2-h pulse of 50% serum, followed by serum-free medium, there were long-term (approximately 50 h) synchronized, homogeneous oscillations in PRL promoter activity. This response was PRL-specific, because in GH3 cells expressing luciferase from the GH or cytomegalovirus promoters, a serum pulse elicited no oscillations in luciferase expression after an initial transient response to serum. The PRL promoter may therefore be a template for an unstable transcription complex subject to stochastic regulation, allowing an oscillatory transcriptional response to physiological signals. This suggests that precise timing and coordination of cell responses to different signal-duration may represent a novel mechanism for coordinating long-term dynamic changes in transcription in cell populations.",,29,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2001-01-01

The same constructs were used in transient expression assays (target sequence on transfected plasmid) and in the generation of stable cell lines (target sequence integrated into cellular chromosomes). In both cases the only distinguishable feature between the cellular systems is the presence of an insert containing the wild-type PPT/HIV-1 sequence, a mutated version with two mismatches, or the absence of the insert altogether. The inhibitory action induced by np-TFOs was restricted to the cellular systems containing the complementary wild-type PPT/HIV-1 target, and consequently can be attributed only to a triple-helix- mediated mechanism.

We have mapped a major transcriptional start site to 80 residues upstream of the translation initiation codon. Reporter gene assays indicate that regulatory sequences responsible for phorbol ester (PMA)-stimulated activity and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-stimulated activity were located within the first 294 bp of the 5'-flanking region upstream from the transcription start site. A deletion mutant was generated that lacked 47 bp between residues - 215 and - 168: in this mutant, six out of seven GGCCCC repeats and two GCTCA repeats were deleted. Serum-stimulated and GM-CSF-stimulated reporter activity were greatly decreased in this deletion mutant and PMA-stimulated activity was slightly decreased. While the coding and 3'-untranslated regions of the human and mouse genes have significant sequence similarity, there was very little sequence similarity in the 5'-flanking regions of the genes from these two species.

Very recently, the development of ultralow-light imaging cameras has enabled the quantitative digital imaging of light signals resulting from luciferase activation in the presence of luciferin substrate. We have applied this technology to the study of PRL promoter activation in individual pituitary tumor cells to study the temporal and spatial characteristics of the expression of a well- characterized pituitary hormone gene. Rat pituitary GH3 cells were transfected by lipofection with a luciferase reporter gene linked to 5000 bp from the human PRL gene 5'-flanking region. A series of stably transfected cell clones were generated, and one of these was chosen for detailed study on the basis of appropriate regulation of high-level luciferase expression by a series of known stimuli including TRH, forskolin, the calcium channel agonist Bay K8644, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). These cells were subjected to direct imaging of luciferase activity using a Hamamatsu photon- counting camera linked to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope with an Argus-50 image processor. Cells were exposed to 1 mM luciferin, and images were integrated over 30-min periods for up to 72 h. The total photon count over a given field settled to steady levels within 10 h and then remained constant for over 55 h. Addition of forskolin, TRH, or bFGF increased the total photon count of fields of 20-100 cells by 2- to 4-fold consistent with previous data from transient expression assays using the human PRL promoter. Individual cells, on the other hand, showed marked temporal and spatial heterogeneity and variability of luciferase expression when studied at 3-h intervals. Unstimulated cells showed variable luciferase expression with up to 40-fold excursions in photon counts per single cell area within 12-h periods. Stimulation of cells with either TRH, forskolin, or bFGF resulted in smooth increases in photon output over fields of 20-100 cells, but again individual cell responses differed widely, with some cells showing slow progressive rises in photon output, others showing phasic or transient responses, and yet others showing no response. In conclusion, we found a surprising degree of heterogeneity and temporal variability in the level of gene expression in individual living pituitary tumor cells over long periods of time, with markedly divergent responses to hormonal or intracellular stimulation. The use of stably transfected clonal cell lines with extended periods of reporter gene imaging offers a valuable insight into control of gene expression in living cells in real time.",,70,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,1998-01-01

The esters themselves were not substrates for purified luciferase, but four were substrates for a purified esterase and all appeared to be hydrolysed to luciferin within mammalian cells. At a substrate concentration of 0.01 mM, the peak luminescence from the cos cells expressing luciferase was up to 6-fold greater with the esters than with unmodified luciferin. At 0.1 mM, the difference between luciferin and the esters was decreased. The kineties of the luminescent signal with the different luciferin esters varied significantly, indicating possible differences in the rates of uptake, breakdown and enzyme inhibition. The esters did not support luminescence from Escherichia coli cells expressing firefly luciferase, suggesting a lack of appropriate esterase activity in this particular strain. The esters could be useful for the assay of luciferase expression in intact mammalian cells when luciferin levels are limiting, for example in tissues, and in plants.

Inflammatory lifestyle factors increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Zinc deficiency is the most prevalent malnutrition in the world and may be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease potentially through enhanced inflammation, although evidence for this is limited. Here we provide epidemiological evidence suggesting that zinc supplementation was associated with reduced risk and slower cognitive decline, in people with Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. Using the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease fed a control (35mg/kg zinc) or diet deficient in zinc (3mg/kg zinc), we determined that zinc deficiency accelerated Alzheimer's-like memory deficits without modifying amyloid b plaque burden in the brains of male mice. The NLRP3-inflammasome complex is one of the most important regulators of inflammation, and we show here that zinc deficiency in immune cells, including microglia, potentiated NLRP3 responses to inflammatory stimuli in vitro, including amyloid oligomers, while zinc supplementation inhibited NLRP3 activation. APP/PS1 mice deficient in NLRP3 were protected against the accelerated cognitive decline with zinc deficiency. Collectively, this research suggests that zinc status is linked to inflammatory reactivity and may be modified in people to reduce the risk and slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's disease | APP/PS1 | Inflammation | Microglia | NLRP3 | Zinc,2,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2021-03-01

In many cases, secretion of IL-1 cytokines appears to be closely coupled to cell death, yet the secretory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the secretion of the three best-characterized members of the IL-1 superfamily, IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-18, in a range of conditions and cell types, including murine bone marrow-derived and peritoneal macrophages, human monocyte-derived macrophages, HeLa cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We discovered that IL-1β and IL-18 share a common secretory pathway that depends upon membrane permeability and can operate in the absence of complete cell lysis and cell death. We also found that the pathway regulating the trafficking of IL-1α is distinct from the pathway regulating IL-1β and IL-18. Although the release of IL-1α could also be dissociated from cell death, it was independent of the effects of the membrane-stabilizing agent punicalagin, which inhibited both IL-1β and IL-18 release. These results reveal that in addition to their role as danger signals released from dead cells, IL-1 family cytokines can be secreted in the absence of cell death.

The IL-1 ligands have a different evolutionary history. The first proto-IL-1β gene coincided with proto-IL-1R1 and duplication events resulted in the majority of IL-1 ligand family members. However, large evolutionary distances are observed for IL-1α, IL-18 and IL-33 proteins. Further analysis show that IL-33 and IL-18 have poor sequence similarity and no chromosomal evidence of common ancestry with the IL-1β cluster and therefore should not be included in the IL-1 ligand ancestral family.

Inflammatory mediators include cytokines of the interleukin-1 family, such as IL-1α and IL-1β. Unlike IL-1β, IL-1α carries an N-terminal nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and is trafficked to the nucleus. The importance of IL-1α nuclear localisation is poorly understood. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to make inactivating mutations to the NLS on the Il1a gene. A colony of NLS mutant mice was successfully generated with precise knock-in mutations to incapacitate NLS function. NLS mutant mice had no gross changes in immunophenotype or inflammatory response but, surprisingly, failed to express IL-1α. We deduced that, in making specific mutations in the Il1a gene, we also mutated a long-noncoding (lnc)RNA in the complementary strand which has cis-regulatory transcriptional control of the Il1a gene itself. The mutations generated in the Il1a gene also result in mutation of the lncRNA sequence and a predicted alteration of its secondary structure, potentially explaining a subsequent failure to function as a transcriptional activator of Il1a expression. Thus, lncRNA secondary structure may regulate IL-1α expression.

Here, we use 2APB as a chemical scaffold to build a series of inhibitors, the NBC series, which inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in vitro and in vivo without affecting Ca2+ homeostasis. The core chemical insight of this work is that the oxazaborine ring is a critical feature of the NBC series, and the main biological insight the use of NBC inhibitors led to was that NLRP3 inflammasome activation was independent of Ca2+. The NBC compounds represent useful tools to dissect NLRP3 function, and may lead to oxazaborine ring-containing therapeutics.

Lipopolysaccharide and ATP treatment of intestinal epithelial cells and infection with T. gondii in vitro did not promote inflammasome-associated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or IL-18 secretion, but promoted C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), tumour necrosis factor-α and IL-6 production that were significantly reduced when the P2X7R was blocked. Similarly, in vivo, infection with either T. spiralis or T. gondii induced rapid upregulation of epithelial CCL5 in wild-type (wild-type (WT)) mice that was significantly reduced in P2X7R-/- littermate controls. The effects of reduced epithelial CCL5 were assayed by investigating recruitment of dendritic cells (DCs) to the epithelium. Infection induced a rapid recruitment of CD11c+ CD10+ DC subsets into the epithelial layer of WT mice but not P2X7R-/- mice.

Excessive IL-1β production is a characteristic of most chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, which affect a large proportion of the global population. The production of bioactive IL-1β is mediated by a caspase-1-activating complex known as an ‘inflammasome’. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been associated with several human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and represents a potential therapeutic target for disrupting IL-1β production. We used molecular modeling guided by molecular dynamics simulations to design α-helical stapled peptides targeting the pyrin domain of the adaptor protein ASC to interrupt the development of its filament, which is crucial for NLRP3 inflammasome formation. The peptides were effectively internalized by human monocytic cells and efficiently suppressed the release of the inflammasome-regulated cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, following exogenous activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The peptides reduced ASC speck formation and caspase-1 processing thereby suppressing pro-IL-1β processing and release of active IL-1β. This is the first demonstration of the successful use of stapled peptides designed to target the adaptor protein ASC, and can be extended to other inflammatory pathways to disrupt excessive IL-1β production.",,4,1,A*STAR,1231 A001,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research",papers by authors,5,2019-12-01

However, the pathogenesis mechanisms of various AB clonal groups are understudied. Although inflammation-associated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels and IL-1 receptor antagonist polymorphisms were previously implicated in MDR-AB-related pneumonia in patients, whether inflammasomes has any role in the host defense and/or pathogenesis of clinically relevant A. baumannii infection is unknown. Using a sublethal mouse pneumonia model, we demonstrate that an extensively drug-resistant clinical isolate (ICII) of A. baumannii exhibits reduced/delayed early pulmonary neutrophil recruitment, higher lung persistence, and, most importantly, elicits enhanced IL-1β/IL-18 production and lung damage through NLRP3 inflammasome, in comparison with A. baumannii-type strain. A. baumannii infection-induced IL-1β/IL-18 production is entirely dependent on NLRP3-ASC-caspase-1/caspase-11 pathway. Using Nlrp3 mice infection models, we further show that while NLRP3 inflammasome pathway contributes to host defense against A. baumannii clinical isolate, it is dispensable for protection against A. baumannii-type strain.

In the current study, using Nod2-/- mice and an in vivo sublethal model of pulmonary infection, we show that Nod2 contributes to the early lung defense against A. baumannii infection through reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production as Nod2-/- mice showed significantly reduced production of ROS/RNS in the lungs following A. baumannii infection. Consistent with the higher bacterial load, A. baumannii-induced neutrophil recruitment, cytokine/chemokine response and lung pathology was also exacerbated in Nod2-/- mice at early time points post-infection. Finally, we show that administration of Nod2 ligand muramyl dipeptide (MDP) prior to infection protected the wild- type mice from A. baumannii pulmonary challenge.

These MSU crystals elicit acute inflammation characterized by massive infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes that are mobilized by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. MSU crystals also activate the complement system, which regulates the inflammatory response; however, it is unclear whether or how MSU-mediated complement activation is linked to IL-1β release in vivo, and the various roles that might be played by individual components of the complement cascade. Here we show that exposure to MSU crystals in vivo triggers the complement cascade, leading to the generation of the biologically active complement proteins C3a and C5a. C5a, but not C3a, potentiated IL-1β and IL-1α release from LPS-primed MSU-exposed peritoneal macrophages and human monocytic cells in vitro; while in vivo MSU-induced C5a mediated murine neutrophil recruitment as well as IL-1β production at the site of inflammation. These effects were significantly ameliorated by treatment of mice with a C5a receptor antagonist. Mechanistic studies revealed that C5a most likely increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and not through increased transcription of inflammasome components. Therefore we conclude that C5a generated upon MSU-induced complement activation increases neutrophil recruitment in vivo by promoting IL-1 production via the generation of ROS, which activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Identification of the C5a receptor as a key determinant of IL-1-mediated recruitment of inflammatory cells provides a novel potential target for therapeutic intervention to mitigate gouty arthritis.",C5a | Gout | IL-1β | Neutrophils | NLRP3 inflammasome,29,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2017-01-01

In this article, we show that alum adjuvanticity requires IL-2 specifically released by DCs, even when T cell secretion of IL-2 is intact. We demonstrate that alum, as well as other sterile particulates, such as uric acid crystals, induces DCs to produce IL-2 following initiation of actin-mediated phagocytosis that leads to Src and Syk kinase activation, Ca2+ mobilization, and calcineurin-dependent activation of NFAT, the master transcription factor regulating IL-2 expression. Using chimeric mice, we show that DC-derived IL-2 is required for maximal Ag-specific proliferation of CD4+ T cells and optimal humoral responses following alum-adjuvanted immunization.

Here, we show that bone marrow-derived macrophages exhibit endogenous p53 activity, which is increased when macrophages are polarized to the M2 (alternatively activated macrophage) subtype. This leads to reduced expression of M2 genes. Nutlin-3a, which destabilizes the p53MDM2 (mouse double minute 2 homolog) complex, promotes p53 activation and further downregulates M2 gene expression. In contrast, increased expression of M2 genes was apparent in M2-polarized macrophages from p53-deficient and p53 mutant mice. Furthermore, we show, in mice, that p53 also regulates M2 polarization in peritoneal macrophages from interleukin-4-challenged animals and that nutlin-3a retards the development of tolerance to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. P53 acts via transcriptional repression of expression of c-Myc (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) gene by directly associating with its promoter. These data establish a role for the p53MDM2c-MYC axis as a physiological 'brake' to the M2 polarization process. This work reveals a hitherto unknown role for p53 in macrophages, provides further insight into the complexities of macrophage plasticity and raises the possibility that p53-activating drugs, many of which are currently being trialled clinically, may have unforeseen effects on macrophage function.",,73,1,A*STAR,undefined,"Agency for Science, Technology and Research",papers by authors,0,2015-07-01

Although it is a leading cause of asthma, little is known how it induces allergy. Using a novel murine asthma model induced by intranasal exposure to B. tropicalis, we observed that a single intranasal sensitization to B. tropicalis extract induces strong Th2 priming in the lung draining lymph node. Resident CD11b+ dendritic cells (DCs) preferentially transport Ag from the lung to the draining lymph node and are crucial for the initiation of Th2 CD4+ T cell responses. As a consequence, mice selectively deficient in CD11b+ DCs exhibited attenuated Th2 responses and more importantly did not develop any allergic inflammation. Conversely, mice deficient in CD103+ DCs and CCR2-dependent monocyte-derived DCs exhibited similar allergic inflammation compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also show that CD11b+ DCs constitutively express higher levels of GM-CSF receptor compared with CD103+ DCs and are thus selectively licensed by lung epithelial-derived GM-CSF to induce Th2 immunity. Taken together, our study identifies GM-CSF- licensed CD11b + lung DCs as a key component for induction of Th2 responses and represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention in allergy.

However, the host innate immune mechanisms controlling A. baumannii are not well understood. Although viewed as an extracellular pathogen, A. baumannii can also invade and survive intracellularly. However, whether host innate immune pathways sensing intracellular bacteria contribute to immunity against A. baumannii is not known. Here, we provide evidence for the first time that intracellular antibacterial innate immune receptors Nod1 and Nod2, and their adaptor Rip2, play critical roles in the sensing and clearance of A. baumannii by human airway epithelial cells in vitro. A. baumannii infection upregulated Rip2 expression. Silencing of Nod1, Nod2, and Rip2 expression profoundly increased intracellular invasion and prolonged the multiplication and survival of A. baumannii in lung epithelial cells. Notably, the Nod1/2-Rip2 axis did not contribute to the control of A. baumannii infection of human macrophages, indicating that they play cell type-specific roles. The Nod1/2-Rip2 axis was needed for A. baumannii infection- induced activation of NF-κB but not mitogen-activated protein kinases. Moreover, the Nod1/2-Rip2 axis was critical to induce optimal cytokine and chemokine responses to A. baumannii infection. Mechanistic studies showed that the Nod1/2 pathway contributed to the innate control of A. baumannii infection through the production of β-defensin 2 by airway epithelial cells. This study revealed new insights into the immune control of A. baumannii and may contribute to the development of effective immune therapeutics and vaccines against A. baumannii. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.",,32,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2014-03-01

The NLRP3 inflammasome is the best-characterized member of the family and has recently been implicated in gut homeostasis and determining the severity of inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and inflammation-associated colorectal cancer. This led to the discovery that NLRP6 and NLRP12 also contribute to the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and modulation of the gut microbiota, which in turn influences the intestine and distant organs. In this review, we bring together the latest data on the potential roles of NLRP family members in gut health and disease and identify the most pressing questions that remain to be answered to further our understanding of human diseases including IBD, inflammation-associated cancers, and metabolic syndromes linked with obesity.

Here, we report the generation and engineering of a new fully human antibody that binds tightly to IL-1β with a neutralization potency more than 10 times higher than that of the marketed antibody canakinumab. After affinity maturation, the derived antibody shows a >30-fold increased affinity to human IL-1β compared with its parent antibody. This anti-human IL-1β IgG also cross-reacts with mouse and monkey IL-1β, hence facilitating preclinical development. In a number of mouse models, this antibody efficiently reduced or abolished signs of disease associated with IL-1β pathology.

The inflammasome drives caspase-1 activation and promotes secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and might also participate in other cellular processes. Here, we tried to identify new pathways regulated by the NLRP3 inflammasome in murine dendritic cells (DCs) in response to monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. Using a transcriptomic approach, we found that DCs from Nlrp3-/- mice responded to MSU with differential expression of genes involved in the DNA damage response and apoptosis. Upon exposure to MSU or other ROS-mobilizing stimuli (rotenone and γ-radiation), DNA fragmentation was markedly ameliorated in Nlrp3-/- and casp-1-/- DCs compared with WT DCs. Moreover, Nlrp3-/- DCs experienced significantly less oxidative DNA damage mediated by ROS. A significant decrease of the expression of several genes involved in double-strand and base-excision DNA repair was observed in WT DCs. Basal DNA repair capacity in WT DCs resulted in activation and stabilization of p53 in vitro and in vivo, which resulted in increased cell death compared with that in Nlrp3-/- DCs. These data provide the first evidence for the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in DNA damage responses induced by cellular stress. © 2013 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, dysregulation of complement is critical to several autoimmune and inflammatory syndromes. Elevated expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β is often linked to such diseases. In this study, we reveal the mechanistic link between complement and IL-1β secretion using murine dendritic cells. IL-1β secretion occurs following intracellular caspase-1 activation by inflammasomes. We show that complement elicits secretion of both IL-1β and IL-18 in vitro and in vivo via the NLRP3 inflammasome. This effect depends on the inflammasome components NLRP3 and ASC, as well as caspase-1 activity. Interestingly, sublethal complement membrane attack complex formation, but not the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo. These findings provide insight into the molecular processes underlying complement-mediated inflammation and highlight the possibility of targeting IL-1β to control complement-induced disease and pathological inflammation. © 2013 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",,121,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2013-08-01

T-cells are activated more effectively by DCs than by B-cells, but little is known about the key molecular mechanisms that underpin the particular potency of DC in triggering T-cell responses. To better understand the influence of physical intercellular interactions on APC efficacy in activating T-cells, we used single cell force spectroscopy to characterize and compare the mechanical forces of interactions between DC:T-cells and B:T-cells. Following antigen stimulation, intercellular interactions of DC:T-cell conjugates were stronger than B:T-cell interactions. DCs induced higher levels of T-cell calcium mobilization and production of IL-2 and IFNγ than were elicited by B-cells, thus suggesting that tight intercellular contacts are important in providing mechanically stable environment to initiate T-cell activation. Blocking antibodies targeting surface co-stimulatory molecules CD80 or CD86 weakened intercellular interactions and dampen T-cell activation, highlighting the amplificatory roles of CD80/86 in regulating APC:T-cell interactions and T-cell functional activation. The variable strength of mechanical forces between DC:T-cells and B:T-cell interactions were not solely dependent on differential APC expression of CD80/86, since DCs were superior to B-cells in promoting strong interactions with T-cells even when CD80 and CD86 were inhibited.

NFAT signalling can also mediate granulocyte and dendritic cell (DC) activation, but it is unknown whether NFAT influences their development from progenitors. Here, we report a novel role for calcineurin/NFAT signalling as a negative regulator of myeloid haematopoiesis. Reconstituting lethally irradiated mice with haematopoietic stem cells expressing an NFAT-inhibitory peptide resulted in enhanced development of the myeloid compartment. Culturing bone marrow cells in media supplemented with Flt3-L in the presence of the calcineurin/NFAT inhibitor Cyclosporin A increased numbers of differentiated DC. Global gene expression analysis of untreated DC and NFAT-inhibited DC revealed differential expression of transcripts that regulate cell cycle and apoptosis. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that calcineurin/NFAT signalling negatively regulates myeloid lineage development.

For example, cross-talk of TLR and C-type lectin signaling effectively shapes distinct gene expression patterns by integrating the signals at the level of NF-κB. In this study, we extend this principle to a strong synergism between the dectin-1 agonist curdlan and an inflammatory growth factor, GM-CSF. Both together act in synergy in inducing a strong inflammatory signature that converts immature dendritic cells (DCs) to potent effector DCs. A variety of cytokines (IL- 1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-2, and IL-12p70), costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40, and CD70), chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL12, CCL17), as well as receptors and molecules involved in fugal recognition and immunity such as Mincle, dectin-1, dectin-2, and pentraxin 3 are strongly upregulated in DC treated simultaneously with curdlan and GM-CSF. The synergistic effect of both stimuli resulted in strong IkBa phosphorylation, its rapid degradation, and enhanced nuclear translocation of all NF-κB subunits. We further identified MAPK ERK as one possible integration site of both signals, because its phosphorylation was clearly augmented when curdlan was coapplied with GM-CSF. Our data demonstrate that the immunomodulatory activity of curdlan requires an additional signal provided by GM-CSF to successfully initiate a robust β-glucan-specific cytokine and chemokine response. The integration of both signals clearly prime and tailor a more effective innate and adaptive response against invading microbes and fungi.

Uric acid modulation of innate immune responses has been extensively studied, but the impact of this damage-associated molecular pattern on adaptive responses remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that, in the presence of NF-κB signaling, uric acid crystals were capable of stimulating dendritic cells to promote the release of cytokines associated with Th17 polarization. Accordingly, naive CD4 + T cells cocultured with uric acid-treated dendritic cells differentiated toward the Th17 lineage. Th17 differentiation required the inflammasome-dependent cytokines IL-1α/β and IL-18 in both in vitro and in vivo models, and the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC and caspase-1 were essential for Th17 responses. Collectively, our findings indicate a novel role for the danger signal uric acid, in cooperation with NF-κB activation, in driving proinflammatory Th17 differentiation.

Despite remarkable progress in delineating detailed molecular components at the intercellular contacts, little is known about the functional roles of physical cross-junctional adhesion between Tand DC in shaping T cell responses. In addition, the mechanisms underlying sensitivity and specificity of Ag discrimination by T cells at intercellular contacts remain to be elucidated. In this study, we use single-cell force spectroscopy to probe the mechanical interactions between DC and T cells in response to stimulation with a panel of altered peptide ligands. The results show that intercellular interactions of DC-T cell conjugates exhibited different ranges of interaction forces in peptide-dependent manners that match the ability of the peptides to activate T cells. Elevated calcium mobilization and IL-2 secretion by T cells were only promoted in response to antigenic peptides that induce strong interaction forces, suggesting that mechanically stable DC-T cell contacts are crucial for driving T cell activation. Strong interactions were not solely dependent on cell-surface molecules such as TCRs and the adhesion molecule LFA-1, but were also controlled by cytoskeletal dynamics and the integrity of membrane lipid rafts. These data provide novel mechanical insights into the effect of Ag affinity on intercellular contacts that align with T cell responsiveness.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the best examples of successful co-evolution, since the bacilli have infected one third of the human population, but in 90% of the cases without causing overt disease. Despite this, increasing incidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and the emergence of drug-resistant strains means that tuberculosis is in fact an extremely serious emerging threat to global health. Decades of work have focused on the interaction of this pathogen with its established cellular host, the macrophage, but still novel therapeautics remain elusive. While the macrophage is clearly important, recent evidence suggests that understanding the role of dendritic cells, which are key regulators of immunity, may be a crucial step in identifying new means of controlling this disease.

Transcriptional profiling using microarrays provides a unique opportunity to decipher host pathogen cross-talk on the global level. Here, for the first time, we have been able to investigate gene expression changes in both Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major human pathogen, and its human host cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Mothodalogy/Principal Findings. In addition to common responses, we could identify eukaryotic and microbial transcriptional signatures that are specific to the cell type involved in the infection process. In particular M. tuberculosis shows a marked stress response when inside dendritic cells, which is in accordance with the low permissivity of these specialized phagocytes to the tubercle bacillus and to other pathogens. In contrast, the mycobacterial transcriptome inside macrophages reflects that of replicating bacteria. On the host cell side, differential responses to infection in macrophages and dendritic cells were identified in genes involved in oxidative stress, intracellular vesicle trafficking and phagosome acidification. Conclusions/Significance. This study provides the proof of principle that probing the host and the microbe transcriptomes simultaneously is a valuable means to accessing unique information on host pathogen interactions. Our results also underline the extraordinary plasticity of host cell and pathogen responses to infection, and provide a solid framework to further understand the complex mechanisms involved in immunity to M. tuberculosis and in mycobacterial adaptation to different intracellular environments. © 2008 Tailleux et al.",,144,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2008-01-01

To investigate the efficacy of ex vivo gene therapy with self-inactivating lentiviral vectors (LVs) in correcting this complex phenotype, we used an ADA-/- mouse model characterized by early post-natal lethality. LV-mediated ADA gene transfer into bone marrow cells combined with low-dose irradiation rescued mice from lethality and restored their growth, as did transplantation of wild-type bone marrow. Mixed chimerism with multilineage engraftment of transduced cells was detected in the long term in animals that underwent transplantation. ADA activity was normalized in lymphocytes and partially corrected in red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in full metabolic detoxification and prevention of severe pulmonary insufficiency. Moreover, gene therapy restored normal lymphoid differentiation and immune functions, including antigen-specific antibody production. Similar degrees of detoxification and immune reconstitution were obtained in mice treated early after birth or after 1 month of enzyme-replacement therapy, mimicking 2 potential applications for ADA-SCID. Overall, this study demonstrates the efficacy of LV gene transfer in correcting both the immunological and metabolic phenotypes of ADA-SCID and supports the future clinical use of this approach. © 2006 by The American Society of Hematology.",,62,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2006-11-01

The numbers of CD4+ T cells, including CD45RA+CD62L+ and, to a lesser extent, CD45RA-CD62L+/RA+CD62L- were significantly reduced in patients, whereas CD8+ T cells were within normal range. In contrast, HLA-DR+ cells were increased both in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. To assess the thymic output, we analysed the presence of T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs) in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by quantitative PCR. TRECs were decreased significantly in patients and the rate of TREC loss was higher with increasing age. TRECs correlated with naive CD4+ T cells, whereas there was an inverse relationship between TRECs and CD8+HLA-DR+ and CD8+CD45RA-CD62L+/RA+CD62L - T cells. Our results suggest the presence of a defect in the naive T cell compartment with origin at the thymic level in CVID, and indicate that TREC may be a useful marker to monitor thymic function in this primary immunodeficiency.",Diseases | Gene | Immunodeficiency | Lymphocytes | Rearrangement | T | Thymus,59,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2002-10-01

We have now investigated the mechanism of action of a new analogue of UP, PNU156804, which shows a more favorable activity profile than UP in mice. We demonstrate here that the biological effect of PNU156804 in vitro is indistinguishable from UP: PNU156804 blocks human T cell proliferation in mid-late G1, as determined by cell cycle analysis, expression of cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinases and retinoblastoma phosphorylation. In addition, we show that PNU156804 does not block significantly the induction of either IL-2 or IL-2R α- and γ-chains but inhibits IL-2-dependent T cell proliferation. We have investigated several molecular pathways that are known to be activated by IL-2 in T cells. We show that PNU156804 does not inhibit c-myc and bcl-2 mRNA induction. On the other hand, PNU156804 efficiently inhibits the activation of the NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors. PNU156804 inhibition of NF-κB activation is due to the inhibition of the degradation of IκB-α and IκB-β. PNU156804 action is restricted to some signaling pathways; it does not affect NF-κB activation by PMA in T cells but blocks that induced by CD40 cross-linking in B lymphocytes.

UP blocks T cell activation in mid to late G1 phase and before entry into S phase, as shown by analysis of the cell cycle and of the expression of c-myc, IL-2, transferrin receptor, and B-myb. UP inhibits only partially the expression of IL-2R, suggesting that the major target of UP is localized downstream from the interaction between IL-2 and its receptor. The expression of cell cycle genes was investigated. The phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein was completely blocked by UP, an event alone sufficient to explain the block of S phase entry and the inhibition of proliferation. The induction of cyclin D2 and the decrease in p27 were not inhibited by UP, whereas the induction of cyclin E, cyclin A, cyclin-dependent kinase-2, and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 was strongly inhibited, potentially explaining the inhibition of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. These data clearly show that the site of action of UP is different from that of both cyclosporin A and rapamycin, and that this new class of compounds may, therefore, be good candidates for combined therapy.",,71,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,1997-04-01

Results: We analyze the network by means of the model combining a deterministic description for molecular species with large cellular concentrations with two classes of stochastic switches: cell-surface receptor activation by TNFα ligand, and IκBα and A20 genes activation by NF-κB molecules. Both stochastic switches are associated with amplification pathways capable of translating single molecular events into tens of thousands of synthesized or degraded proteins. Here, we show that at a low TNFα dose only a fraction of cells are activated, but in these activated cells the amplification mechanisms assure that the amplitude of NF-κB nuclear translocation remains above a threshold. Similarly, the lower nuclear NF-κB concentration only reduces the probability of gene activation, but does not reduce gene expression of those responding. Conclusion: These two effects provide a particular stochastic robustness in cell regulation, allowing cells to respond differently to the same stimuli, but causing their individual responses to be unequivocal. Both effects are likely to be crucial in the early immune response: Diversity in cell responses causes that the tissue defense is harder to overcome by relatively simple programs coded in viruses and other pathogens. The more focused single-cell responses help cells to choose their individual fates such as apoptosis or proliferation. The model supports the hypothesis that binding of single TNFα ligands is sufficient to induce massive NF-κB translocation and activation of NF-κB dependent genes. © 2007 Lipniacki et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,53,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2007-10-01

To better understand this phenomenon, small gene regulatory systems are mathematically modeled as systems of coupled chemical reactions, but the existing exact description utilizing a Chapman-Kolmogorov equation or simulation algorithms is limited and inefficient. The present work considers a much more efficient yet accurate modeling approach, which allows analyzing stochasticity in the system in the terms of the underlying distribution function. We depart from the analysis of a single gene regulatory module to find that the mRNA and protein variance is decomposable into additive terms resulting from respective sources of stochasticity. This variance decomposition is asserted by constructing two approximations to the exact stochastic description: First, the continuous approximation, which considers only the stochasticity due to the intermittent gene activity. Second, the mixed approximation, which in addition attributes stochasticity to the mRNA transcription/decay process. Considered approximations yield systems of first order partial differential equations for the underlying distribution function, which can be efficiently solved using developed numerical methods.

However, the number of alleles in a cell is not constant. In the S phase of the cell cycle all the genome is duplicated and then in the G2 phase and mitosis, which together last for several hours, most of the genes have four copies instead of two. Cancer development is, in many cases, associated with a change in allele number. Several genetic diseases are caused by haploinsufficiency: Lack of one of the alleles or its improper functioning. In the paper we consider the stochastic expression of a gene having a variable number of copies. We applied our previously developed method in which the reaction channels are split into slow (connected with change of gene state) and fast (connected with mRNA/protein synthesis/decay), the later being approximated by deterministic reaction rate equations. As a result we represent gene expression as a piecewise deterministic time-continuous Markov process, which is further related with a system of partial differential hyperbolic equations for probability density functions (pdfs) of protein distribution. The stationary pdfs are calculated analytically for haploidal gene or numerically for diploidal and tetraploidal ones. We distinguished nine classes of simultaneous activation of haploid, diploid and tetraploid genes. This allows for analysis of potential consequences of gene duplication or allele loss. We show that when gene activity is autoregulated by a positive feedback, the change in number of gene alleles may have dramatic consequences for its regulation and may not be compensated by the change of efficiency of mRNA synthesis per allele. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.",Diploid genes | Feedback regulation | Haploinsufficiency | Piecewise deterministic time-continuous Markov process | Stochastic gene expression,12,0,NHLBI,3T11A 019 29,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,1,2007-07-01

Transcription can be initiated by a single transcription factor binding to a specific regulatory site in the target gene. Stochasticity of transcription factor binding and dissociation is then amplified by transcription and translation, since target gene activation results in a burst of mRNA molecules, and each mRNA copy serves as a template for translating numerous protein molecules. In the present paper, we explore a mathematical approach to stochastic modeling. In this approach, the ordinary differential equations with a stochastic component for mRNA and protein levels in a single cells yield a system of first-order partial differential equations (PDEs) for two-dimensional probability density functions (pdf).

The stochasticity of activator binding and dissociation is amplified by transcription and translation, since target gene activation results in a burst of mRNAs molecules, and each copy of mRNA then serves as a template for numerous protein molecules. In this article, we reformulate our model of the NF-κB regulatory module to analyze a single cell regulation. Ordinary differential equations, used for description of fast reaction channels of processes involving a large number of molecules, are combined with a stochastic switch to account for the activity of the genes involved. The stochasticity in gene transcription causes simulated cells to exhibit large variability. Moreover, none of them behaves like an average cell. Although the average mRNA and protein levels remain constant before tumor necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation, and stabilize after a prolonged TNF stimulation, in any single cell these levels oscillate stochastically in the absence of TNF and keep oscillating under the prolonged TNF stimulation. However, in a short period of ∼90 min, most cells are synchronized by the TNF signal, and exhibit similar kinetics. We hypothesize that this synchronization is crucial for proper activation of early genes controlling inflammation. Our theoretical predictions of single cell kinetics are supported by recent experimental studies of oscillations in NF-κB signaling made on single cells. © 2006 by the Biophysical Society.",,78,1,NHLBI,8T07A-045-20,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,1,2006-01-01

In eukaryotes, the stochastic effects are primarily attributable to the binary nature of genes, which are considered either switched ""on"" or ""off"" due to the action of the transcription factors binding to the promoter. In the time period when the gene is activated, bursts of mRNA transcript are produced. In the present paper, we investigate regulation of gene expression at the single cell level. We propose a mechanism of gene regulation, which is able to explain the observed distinct transcription profiles assuming the number of co-regulatory activities, without attempting to identify the specific proteins involved. The model is motivated by our experiments on NF-κB-dependent genes in HeLa cells. Our experimental data shows that NF-κB-dependent genes can be stratified into three characteristic groups according to their expression profiles: early, intermediate and late having maximum of expression at about 1, 3 and 6 h, respectively, from the beging of TNF stimulation. We provide a tractable analytical approach, not only in the terms of expected expression profiles and their moments, which corresponds to the measurements on the cell population, but also in the terms of single cell behavior. Comparison between these two modes of description reveals that single cells behave qualitatively different from the cell population.

The constructed model involves two-compartment kinetics of the activators IκB (IKK) and NF-κB, the inhibitors A20 and IκBα, and their complexes. In resting cells, the unphosphorylated IκBα binds to NF-κB and sequesters it in an inactive form in the cytoplasm. In response to extracellular signals such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1, IKK is transformed from its neutral form (IKKn) into its active form (IKKa), a form capable of phosphorylating IκBα, leading to IκBα degradation. Degradation of IκBα releases the main activator NF-κB, which then enters the nucleus and triggers transcription of the inhibitors and numerous other genes. The newly synthesized IκBα leads NF-κB out of the nucleus and sequesters it in the cytoplasm, while A20 inhibits IKK converting IKKa into the inactive form (IKKi), a form different from IKKn, no longer capable of phosphorylating IκBα.

This process results in membrane insertion and the formation of a lipidic membrane pore, the key intermediate in unconventional secretion of FGF2.

Here we focus on the type I pathway with Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) being the most prominent example. Unconventional secretion of FGF2 from cells is mediated by direct protein translocation across the plasma membrane. A unique feature of this process is the ability of FGF2 to form its own membrane translocation intermediate through oligomerization and membrane insertion. This process depends on the phosphoinositide PI(4,5)P 2 at the inner leaflet and results in the formation of lipidic membrane pores in the plasma membrane. Various lines of evidence suggest that these pores are characterized by a toroidal architecture with FGF2 oligomers being accommodated in the center of these structures. At the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, membrane proximal heparan sulfate proteoglycans are required for the final step of FGF2 translocation into the extracellular space. Based upon mutually exclusive interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P 2 versus heparan sulfates, an assembly/disassembly pathway has been proposed to be the underlying principle of directional transport of FGF2 across the plasma membrane. Thus, the core mechanism of unconventional secretion of FGF2 is based upon three discrete steps with (i) PI(4,5)P 2 dependent oligomerization of FGF2 at the inner leaflet, (ii) insertion of membrane spanning FGF2 oligomers into the plasma membrane and (iii) disassembly at the outer leaflet mediated by heparan sulfates that subsequently retain FGF2 on cell surfaces. This process has recently been reconstituted with an inside-out membrane model system using giant unilamellar vesicles providing a compelling explanation of how FGF2 reaches the extracellular space in an ER/Golgi independent manner.

FGF2 is secreted from cells through an unconventional secretory mechanism based upon direct translocation across the plasma membrane. The molecular mechanism underlying this process depends on a surprisingly small set of trans-acting factors that are physically associated with the plasma membrane. FGF2 membrane translocation is mediated by the ability of FGF2 to oligomerise and to insert into the plasma membrane in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner. Membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers are dynamic translocation intermediates that are disassembled at the extracellular leaflet mediated by membrane proximal heparan sulphate proteoglycans. This process results in the exposure of FGF2 on cell surfaces as part of its unconventional mechanism of secretion.

FGF2 is secreted by an unconventional secretory mechanism that involves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent insertion of FGF2 oligomers into the plasma membrane. This process is regulated by Tec kinase-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of FGF2. Molecular interactions driving FGF2 monomers into membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers are unknown. Here we identify two surface cysteines that are critical for efficient unconventional secretion of FGF2. They represent unique features of FGF2 as they are absent from all signal-peptide-containing members of the FGF protein family. We show that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-dependent FGF2 oligomerization concomitant with the generation of membrane pores depends on FGF2 surface cysteines as either chemical alkylation or substitution with alanines impairs these processes. We further demonstrate that the FGF2 variant forms lacking the two surface cysteines are not secreted from cells. These findings were corroborated by experiments redirecting a signal-peptide-containing FGF family member from the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi-dependent secretory pathway into the unconventional secretory pathway of FGF2. Cis elements known to be required for unconventional secretion of FGF2, including the two surface cysteines, were transplanted into a variant form of FGF4 without signal peptide. The resulting FGF4/2 hybrid protein was secreted by unconventional means.

Using molecular and biochemical-approaches we show here that Dnmt2 is both a cytoplasmic and a nuclear protein. Sub-cellular fractionation shows that a significant amount of Dnmt2 is bound to the nuclear matrix. Sub-cellular localization analysis reveals that Dnmt2 proteins are enriched in actively dividing cells. Dnmt2 localization is highly dynamic during the cell cycle. Using live imaging we observed that Dnmt2-EGFP enters prophase nuclei and shows a spindle-like localization pattern during mitotic divisions, Additional experiments suggest that this localization is microtubule dependent and that Dnmt2 can access DNA during mitotic cell divisions.

Various kinds of unconventional secretory processes have been described, including two major pathways for two distinct sets of cargoes that are initially synthesized as soluble proteins in the cytoplasm. These two pathways are mechanistically distinct from one another. One is based upon direct protein translocation across lipidic pores in the plasma membrane (type I unconventional secretion). The second pathway involves the recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins into vesicular compartments of the endocytic membrane system that fuse with the plasma membrane to release proteins into the extracellular space (type III unconventional secretion). This primer highlights the mechanisms and molecular machineries of these pathways that were discovered with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2; type I) and acyl-CoA binding protein (Acb1; type III) as the most prominent cargo proteins. Furthermore, the physiological significance of these secretory routes in both health and disease is discussed for a broader range of cargo proteins.

This can be initiated by the recombinant FGF2 ligand supplied exogenously, but hPSC further support their niche by secretion of endogenous FGF2. In this study, we describe a role of tyrosine kinase expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (TEC) kinase in this process. We show that TEC-mediated FGF2 secretion is essential for hPSC self-renewal, and its lack mediates specific differentiation. Following both short hairpin RNA- and small interfering RNA-mediated TEC knockdown, hPSC secretes less FGF2. This impairs hPSC proliferation that can be rescued by increasing amounts of recombinant FGF2. TEC downregulation further leads to a lower expression of the pluripotency markers, an improved priming towards neuroectodermal lineage, and a failure to develop cardiac mesoderm. Our data thus demonstrate that TEC is yet another regulator of FGF2-mediated hPSC pluripotency and differentiation.

Although mechanisms of unconventional protein secretion are beginning to emerge, the precise molecular details have remained elusive for the majority of cargo proteins secreted by unconventional means. Recent findings suggest that for two examples of unconventionally secreted proteins, interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), the common molecular principle of pore formation may be shared. Under specific experimental conditions, secretion of IL-1β and FGF2 is triggered by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]- dependent formation of pores across the plasma membrane. However, the underlying mechanisms are different, with FGF2 known to directly interact with PI(4,5)P2, whereas in the case of IL- 1β secretion, it is proposed that the N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D interacts with PI(4,5)P2 to form the pore. Thus, although implemented in different ways, these findings suggest that pore formation may be shared by the unconventional secretion mechanisms for FGF2 and IL-1β in at least some cases.

Due to their highly controlled synthesis and role in signaling events sphingolipids are an intensely studied class of lipids. In order to investigate their metabolism and to study proteins interacting with sphingolipids, metabolic labeling based on photoactivatable sphingoid bases is the most straightforward approach. In order to monitor protein-lipid-crosslink products, sphingosine derivatives containing a reporter moiety, such as a radiolabel or a clickable group, are used. In normal cells, degradation of sphingoid bases via action of the checkpoint enzyme sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase occurs at position C2-C3 of the sphingoid base and channels the resulting hexadecenal into the glycerolipid biosynthesis pathway. In case the functionalized sphingosine looses the reporter moiety during its degradation, specificity towards sphingolipid labeling is maintained. In case degradation of a sphingosine derivative does not remove either the photoactivatable or reporter group from the resulting hexadecenal, specificity towards sphingolipid labeling can be achieved by blocking sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase activity and thus preventing sphingosine derivatives to be channeled into the sphingolipid-to-glycerolipid metabolic pathway. Here we report an approach using clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated nuclease Cas9 to create a sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase (SGPL1) HeLa knockout cell line to disrupt the sphingolipidto-glycerolipid metabolic pathway. We found that the lipid and protein compositions as well as sphingolipid metabolism of SGPL1 knock-out HeLa cells only show little adaptations, which validates these cells as model systems to study transient protein-sphingolipid interactions.",,20,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2016-04-01

Toward this goal, we developed a strategy of dual SILAC labeling astrocytic cultures for in silico exclusion of unlabeled proteins from serum or neurons used for stimulation. For constitutive secretion, this strategy allowed the precise quantification of the extra-to-intracellular protein ratio of more than 2000 identified proteins. Ratios covered 4 orders of magnitude indicating that the intracellular vs extracellular contributions of different proteins can be variable. Functionally, the secretome of labeled forebrain astrocytic cultures specifically changed within hours after adding unlabeled, ""physiological"" forebrain neurons.

Nef associates with membranes via an N-terminal Src homology 4 (SH4) domain, and membrane association is believed to be essential for its biological functions. At which subcellular site(s) Nef exerts its different functions and how kinetics of membrane interactions contribute to its biological activity are unknown. To address how specific characteristics of Nef membrane association affect its biological properties, the SH4 domain of Nef was replaced by heterologous membrane targeting domains. The use of a panel of heterologous SH4 domains resulted in chimeric Nef proteins with distinct steady state subcellular localization, membrane association efficiency, and anterograde transport routes. Irrespective of these modifications, cardinal Nef functions affecting host cell vesicular transport and actin dynamics were fully preserved. In contrast, stable targeting of Nef to the surface of mitochondria, peroxisomes, or the Golgi apparatus, and thus prevention of plasma membrane delivery, caused potent and broad loss of Nef activity. These results support the concept that Nef adopts its active conformation in the membrane-associated state but exclude that membrane-associated Nef simply acts by recruiting soluble factors independently of its local microenvironment. Rather than its steady state subcellular localization or membrane affinity, the ability to undergo dynamic anterograde and internalization cycles appear to determine Nef function. These results reveal that functional membrane interactions of Nef underlie critical spatiotemporal regulation and suggest that delivery to distinct subcellular sites via such transport cycles provides the basis for the multifunctionality of Nef. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,9,1,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,papers by authors,0,2014-05-01

STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) and STIM2 Ca2+ sensors oligomerize upon Ca2+ depletion in the ER lumen, contact phosphoinositides at the PM via their cytosolic lysine (K)-rich domains, and activate Ca2+ channels. Differential sensitivities of STIM1 and STIM2 towards ER luminal Ca2+ have been studied but responses towards elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the mechanism of lipid binding remain unclear. We found that tetramerization of the STIM1 K-rich domain is necessary for efficient binding to PI(4,5)P2-containing PM-like liposomes consistent with an oligomerization-driven STIM1 activation. In contrast, dimerization of STIM2 K-rich domain was sufficient for lipid binding. Furthermore, the K-rich domain of STIM2, but not of STIM1, forms an amphipathic α-helix. These distinct features of the STIM2 K-rich domain cause an increased affinity for PI(4,5)P2, consistent with the lower activation threshold of STIM2 and a function as regulator of basal Ca2+ levels. Concomitant with higher affinity for PM lipids, binding of CaM (calmodulin) inhibited the interaction of the STIM2 K-rich domain with liposomes in a Ca2+ and PI(4,5)P2 concentration-dependent manner. Therefore we suggest that elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration down-regulates STIM2-mediated ER-PM contacts via CaM binding. © 2013 The Author(s).",Calmodulin (CaM) | ER-PM contact site | K-rich domain | Phosphoinositides | STIM2 | Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE),36,1,,SE/811-2,,papers by authors,0,2013-11-01

How filopodia are initiated and spatially restricted to specific sites on the plasma membrane is still unclear. Here, we show that the membrane deforming and curvature sensing IRSp53 (Insulin Receptor Substrate of 53 kDa) protein slows down actin filament barbed end growth. This inhibition is relieved by CDC42 and counteracted by VASP, which also binds to IRSp53. The VASP:IRSp53 interaction is regulated by activated CDC42 and promotes high-density clustering of VASP, which is required for processive actin filament elongation. The interaction also mediates VASP recruitment to liposomes. In cells, IRSp53 and VASP accumulate at discrete foci at the leading edge, where filopodia are initiated. Genetic removal of IRSp53 impairs the formation of VASP foci, filopodia and chemotactic motility, while IRSp53 null mice display defective wound healing. Thus, IRSp53 dampens barbed end growth. CDC42 activation inhibits this activity and promotes IRSp53-dependent recruitment and clustering of VASP to drive actin assembly.

As one of its activities in CD4+ T-lymphocytes, Nef potently retargets the Src family kinase (SFK) Lck but not closely related Fyn from the plasma membrane to recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network to tailor T-cell activation and optimize virus replication. Investigating the underlying mechanism we find Lck retargeting involves removal of the kinase from membrane microdomains. Moreover, Nef interferes with rapid vesicular transport of Lck to block anterograde transport and plasma membrane delivery of newly synthesized Lck. The sensitivity of Lck to Nef does not depend on functional domains of Lck but requires membrane insertion of the kinase. Surprisingly, the short N-terminal SH4 domain membrane anchor of Lck is necessary and sufficient to confer sensitivity to Nef-mediated anterograde transport block and microdomain extraction. In contrast, the SH4 domain of Fyn is inert to Nef-mediated manipulation. Nef thus interferes with a specialized membrane microdomain-associated pathway for plasma membrane delivery of newly synthesized Lck whose specificity is determined by the affinity of cargo for these sorting platforms. These results provide new insight into the mechanism of Nef action and the pathways used for SFK plasma membrane delivery. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,10,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2013-10-01

Using computer simulations, we show that entropic forces alone are not sufficient to achieve and maintain full separation of chromosomes. This is, however, possible by assuming repeated binding of chromosomes along a gradient of membrane-associated tethering sites toward the poles. We propose that, in Escherichia coli, such a gradient of membrane tethering sites may be provided by the oscillatory Min system, otherwise known for its role in selecting the cell division site. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that MinD binds to DNA and tethers it to the membrane in an ATP-dependent manner. Taken together, our combined theoretical and experimental results suggest the existence of a novel mechanism of chromosome segregation based on the Min system, further highlighting the importance of active segregation of chromosomes in prokaryotic cell biology.",chromosome segregation | computer simulations | DNA binding | Min system | MinD,54,1,BMBF,undefined,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung,papers by authors,1,2013-01-01

HASPB is a 'non-classically' secreted protein, requiring N-terminal acylation for trafficking to and exposure on the plasma membrane. Here, we use live cell imaging methods to further explore this pathway to the membrane and flagellum. Unlike HASPB trafficking in transfected mammalian cells, we find no evidence for a phosphorylation-regulated recycling pathway in metacyclic parasites. Once at the plasma membrane, HASPB18-GFP (green fluorescent protein) can undergo bidirectional movement within the inner leaflet of the membrane and on the flagellum. Transfer of fluorescent protein between the flagellum and the plasma membrane is compromised, however, suggesting the presence of a diffusion barrier at the base of the Leishmania flagellum. Full-length HASPB is released from the metacyclic parasite surface on to macrophages during phagocytosis but while expression is maintained in intracellular amastigotes, HASPB cannot be detected on the external surface in these cells.

Acylated SH4 domains are both necessary and sufficient to mediate specific targeting of SRC kinases to the inner leaflet of plasma membranes. Intracellular transport of SRC kinases to the plasma membrane depends on microdomains into which SRC kinases partition upon palmitoylation. In the present study, we established a live-cell imaging screening system to identify gene products involved in plasma membrane targeting of SRC kinases. Based on siRNA arrays and a human model cell line expressing two kinds of SH4 reporter molecules, we conducted a genome-wide analysis of SH4-dependent protein targeting using an automated microscopy platform. We identified and validated 54 gene products whose down-regulation causes intracellular retention of SH4 reporter molecules. To detect and quantify this phenotype, we developed a software-based image analysis tool. Among the identified gene products, we found factors involved in lipid metabolism, intracellular transport, and cellular signaling processes. Furthermore, we identified proteins that are either associated with SRC kinases or are related to various known functions of SRC kinases such as other kinases and phosphatases potentially involved in SRC-mediated signal transduction. Finally, we identified gene products whose function is less defined or entirely unknown.

Interleukin 1β (IL1β) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) are classical examples of unconventional secretory proteins with IL1β believed to be present in intracellular vesicles prior to secretion. By contrast, FGF2 represents an example of a non-vesicular mechanism of unconventional secretion. Here, the author discusses the current knowledge about the molecular machinery being involved in FGF2 secretion. To reveal both differential and common requirements, this review further aims at a comprehensive comparison of this mechanism with other unconventional secretory processes. In particular, a potentially general role of tyrosine phosphorylation as a regulatory signal in unconventional protein secretion will be discussed. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Acb1 | AcbA | Acyl-CoA-binding protein | Annexin A2 | Fibroblast growth factor 2 | Heparan sulfate proteoglycans | HIV Tat | Interleukin 1β | Non-classical export | Phosphoinositides | PI(4,5)P 2 | Unconventional protein secretion",52,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2011-07-01

However, manual analysis is impossible for such screens since the amount of image data sets can often be in the hundred thousands. Reliable automated tools are thus required to analyse the fluorescence microscopy image data sets usually containing two or more reaction channels. The herein presented image analysis tool is designed to analyse an RNAi screen investigating the intracellular trafficking and targeting of acylated Src kinases. In this specific screen, a data set consists of three reaction channels and the investigated cells can appear in different phenotypes. The main issue of the image processing task is an automatic cell segmentation which has to be robust and accurate for all different phenotypes and a successive phenotype classification. The cell segmentation is done in two steps by segmenting the cell nuclei first and then using a classifier-enhanced region growing on basis of the cell nuclei to segment the cells. The classification of the cells is realized by a support vector machine which has to be trained manually using supervised learning. Furthermore, the tool is brightness invariant allowing different staining quality and it provides a quality control that copes with typical defects during preparation and acquisition. A first version of the tool has already been successfully applied for an RNAi-screen containing three hundred thousand image data sets and the SVM extended version is designed for additional screens. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",Automated analysis | high-throughput RNAi microscopy | phenotype recognition | supervised learning | support vector machine,0,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2011-06-01

Here, using a highly effective RNAi screening approach, we discovered Tec kinase as a novel factor involved in unconventional secretion of FGF2. Tec kinase does not affect FGF2 secretion by an indirect mechanism, but rather forms a heterodimeric complex with FGF2 resulting in phosphorylation of FGF2 at tyrosine 82, a post-translational modification shown to be essential for FGF2 membrane translocation to cell surfaces. Our findings suggest a crucial role for Tec kinase in regulating FGF2 secretion under various physiological conditions and, therefore, provide a new perspective for the development of a novel class of antiangiogenic drugs targeting the formation of the FGF2/Tec complex. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",FGF2 | Membrane translocation | Non-classical export | Phosphorylation | RNAi screening | Tec kinase | Unconventional protein secretion,55,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2010-06-01

Attached to C-termini of mammalian integral membrane proteins, the CSSIst2 targeted these proteins to PM-associated domains of the ER and abolished trafficking via the classical secretory pathway. The interaction of integral membrane proteins with PI(4,5)P2 at the PM created ER-PM contacts. This process is similar to the regulated coupling of ER domains to the PM via stromal interaction molecule (STIM) proteins during store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). The CSSIst2 and the C-terminus of the ER-located Ca2+ sensor STIM2 were sufficient to bind PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 at the PM, showing that an evolutionarily conserved mechanism is involved in the sorting of integral membrane proteins to PM-associated domains of the ER.

Interaction with phosphatidly-inositolphosphates (PIPs) at the PM is involved in the targeting of the polytopic yeast protein Ist2 to PM-associated domains of the cortical endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Moreover, binding of PI(4,5)P2 at the PM functions as a dominant mechanism that targets other integral membrane proteins to PM-associated domains of the cortical ER. This sorting to a subdomain of the ER abolishes proteasomal degradation and trafficking along the classical secretory (sec) pathway.

These include measurements with the headgroups of membrane lipids in solution, immobilized membrane lipids, and analysis of protein binding to membrane lipids reconstituted in liposomes. Each of these methodologies has strengths but also substantial limitations. For example, measurements between proteins and lipid headgroups or with immobilized membrane lipids do not probe interactions in their natural environment, the lipid bilayer. The use of liposomes, however, was so far mostly restricted to biochemical flotation experiments that do not provide quantitative and/or kinetic data. Here, we present a fast and sensitive flow cytometric method to detect protein-lipid interactions. This technique allows for quantitative measurements of interactions between multiple fluorescently labeled proteins and membrane lipids reconstituted in lipid bilayers. The assay can be used to quantify binding efficiencies and to determine kinetic constants. The method is further characterized by a short sampling time of only a few seconds that allows for high-content screening procedures. Finally, using light scatter measurements, the described method also allows for monitoring changes of membrane curvature as well as tethering of liposomes evoked by binding of proteins.

We report herein the identification of the Golgi complex-associated protein p115 as an intracellular binding partner for MIF. MIF interacts with p115 in the cytoplasm and the stimulated secretion of MIF results in the accumulation of both proteins in supernatants, which is consistent with MIF release from cells in conjunction with p115. The depletion of p115 from monocytes/macrophages decreases the release of MIF but not other cytokines following inflammatory stimulation or intracellular bacterial infection. Notably, the small molecule MIF inhibitor 4-iodo-6-phenylpyrimidine inhibits MIF secretion by targeting the interaction between MIF and p115.

We suggest that a direct interaction of the Ist2 sorting signal with lipids at the plasma membrane places Ist2 at contact sites between cortical ER and plasma membrane.

This loss of function is due to artificial O-glycosylation mainly resulting in the addition of glycosaminoglycan chains of the chrondroitin sulfate type.

SH4-domain-induced blebbing is highly dynamic, with bleb formation and collapse displaying distinct kinetics. These reorganizations of the PM are controlled by Rho but not Rac or Cdc42 GTPase signalling pathways.

Exported HASPB remains anchored in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane mediated by myristate and palmitate residues covalently attached to the N-terminal SH4 domain of HASPB. HASPB targeting to the plasma membrane depends on SH4 acylation that occurs at intracellular membranes. How acylated HASPB is targeted to the plasma membrane and, in particular, the subcellular site of HASPB membrane translocation is unknown. In order to address this issue, we screened for clonal CHO mutants that are incapable of exporting HASPB. A detailed characterization of such a CHO mutant cell line revealed that the expression level of the HASPB reporter molecule is unchanged compared to CHO wild-type cells; that it is both myristoylated and palmitoylated; and that it is mainly localized to the plasma membrane as judged by confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation. However, based on a quantitative flow cytometry assay and a biochemical biotinylation assay of surface proteins, HASPB transport to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is largely reduced in this mutant. From these data, we conclude that the subcellular site of HASPB membrane translocation is the plasma membrane as the reporter molecule accumulates in this location when export is blocked. Thus, these results allow us to define a two-step process of HASPB cell surface biogenesis in which SH4 acylation of HASPB firstly mediates intracellular targeting to the plasma membrane. In a second step, the plasma membrane-resident machinery, which is apparently disrupted in the CHO mutant cell line, mediates membrane translocation of HASPB. Intriguingly, the angiogenic growth factor FGF-2, another protein secreted by unconventional means, is shown to be secreted normally from the HASPB export mutant cell line. These observations demonstrate that the export machinery component defective in the export mutant cell line functions specifically in the HASPB export pathway.",Acylation | Cell surface expression | Fibroblast growth factor 2 | Hydrophilic acylated surface protein | Leishmania parasites | Non-classical protein export | SH4 domain | Surface coat,38,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2005-02-01

The basic machinery required for the formation of these transport intermediates has been elucidated based on the reconstitution of COPI-coated vesicle formation from chemically defined liposomes. In this experimental system, the coat components coatomer and GTP-bound ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), as well as p23 as a membrane-bound receptor for COPI coat proteins, were shown to be both necessary and sufficient to promote COPI-coated vesicle formation. Based on biochemical and ultrastructural analyses, we now demonstrate that the catalytic domain of ARF-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) alone is sufficient to initiate uncoating of liposome-derived COPI-coated vesicles. By contrast, ARF-GAP activity is not required for COPI coat assembly and, therefore, does not seem to represent an essential coat component of COPI vesicles as suggested recently [Yang, J.

In striking contrast, the phenomenon of unconventional protein secretion (also known as nonclassical protein export or ER/Golgi-independent protein secretion) from eukaryotic cells was discovered more than 10 years ago and yet the molecular mechanism and the molecular identity of machinery components that mediate this process remain elusive. This problem appears to be even more complex as several lines of evidence indicate that various kinds of mechanistically distinct nonclassical export routes may exist. In most cases these secretory mechanisms are gated in a tightly controlled fashion. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of our current knowledge as a basis for the development of new experimental strategies designed to unravel the molecular machineries mediating ER/Golgi-independent protein secretion. Beyond solving a fundamental problem in current cell biology, the molecular analysis of these processes is of major biomedical importance as these export routes are taken by proteins such as angiogenic growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, components of the extracellular matrix which regulate cell differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, viral proteins, and parasite surface proteins potentially involved in host infection.",Extracellular localization | FGF-2 trafficking | Galectin trafficking | Interleukin 1α and 1β trafficking | Leishmania HASPB trafficking | Membrane translocation | Nonclassical export | Protein targeting | Unconventional protein secretion,507,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2003-05-01

Here, we establish a functional link between CA125 and β-galactoside-binding, cell-surface lectins, which are components of the extracellular matrix implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion, apoptosis, cell proliferation and tumor progression. On the basis of mass spectrometry and immunological analyses, we find that CA125 is a counter receptor for galectin-1, as both soluble and membrane-associated fragments of CA125 derived from HeLa cell lysates are shown to bind specifically to human galectin-1 with high efficiency. This interaction is demonstrated (1) to depend on β-galactose-terminated, O-linked oligosaccharide chains of CA125, (2) to be preferential for galectin-1 versus galectin-3 and (3) to be regulated by the cellular background in which CA125 is expressed. Despite lacking a conventional signal peptide, a CA125 C-terminal fragment of 1148 amino acids, representing less than 10% of the full-length protein, retains the ability to integrate into secretory membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi, and is targeted to the plasma membrane by conventional secretory transport. As demonstrated by a novel assay that reconstitutes non-conventional secretion of galectin-1 based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), we find that tumor-derived HeLa cells expressing endogenous CA125 present more than ten times as much galectin-1 on their surface compared with non-tumor-derived, CA125-deficient CHO cells. Intriguingly, both the galectin-1 expression level and the cell-surface binding capacity for galectin-1 are shown to be similar in CHO and HeLa cells, suggesting that CA125 might be a factor involved in the regulation of galectin-1 export to the cell surface.",CA125 | Cell-surface expression | Counter receptor | Galectin | Nonclassical export | Tumor antigen,114,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2003-04-01

Consistently, FGF-2 has been shown to be secreted by an ER-Golgi-independent mechanism; however, the machinery mediating this process remains to be established at the molecular level. Here we introduce a novel experimental system based on flow cytometry that allows the quantitative assessment of non-classical FGF-2 secretion in living cells. Stable cell lines have been created by retroviral transduction that express various kinds of FGF-2-GFP fusion proteins in a doxicyclin-dependent manner. Following induction of protein expression, biosynthetic FGF-2-GFP is shown to translocate to the outer surface of the plasma membrane as determined by both fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal microscopy. Both N- and C-terminal GFP tagging of FGF-2 is compatible with FGF-2 export, which is shown to occur in a controlled fashion rather than through unspecific release. The experimental system described has strong implications for the identification of both FGF-2 secretion inhibitors and molecular components involved in FGF-2 secretion. In the second part of this study we made use of the FGF-2 export system described to analyze the fate of biosynthetic FGF-2-GFP following export to the extracellular space. We find that secreted FGF-2 fusion proteins accumulate in large heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-containing protein clusters on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. These microdomains are shown to be distinct from caveolae-like lipid rafts known to play a role in FGF-2-mediated signal transduction. Since CHO cells lack FGF high-affinity receptors (FGFRs), it can be concluded that FGFRs mediate the targeting of FGF-2 to lipid rafts. Consistently, FGF-2-GFP-secreting CHO cells do not exhibit increased proliferation activity. Externalization and deposition of biosynthetic FGF-2 in HSPG-containing protein clusters are independent processes, as a soluble secreted intermediate was demonstrated. The balance between intracellular FGF-2 and HSPG-bound secreted FGF-2 is shown not to be controlled by the availability of cell surface HSPGs, indicating that the FGF-2 secretion machinery itself is rate-limiting.",Extracellular FGF-2 | FGF-2 microdomains | FGF-2 signalling | Membrane translocation | Non-classical protein export | Non-conventional protein secretion,68,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2002-09-01

Using a cross-link approach based on a photolabile peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of p23, the GDP form of ARF1 (ARF1-GDP) is shown to interact with p23 whereas ARF1-GTP has no detectable affinity to p23. The p23 binding is shown to localize specifically to a 22 amino acid C-terminal fragment of ARF1. While a monomeric form of a non-photolabile p23 peptide does not significantly inhibit formation of the cross-link product, the corresponding dimeric form does compete efficiently for this interaction.

Lipids like cholesterol and sphingomyelin are gradually enriched along the secretory pathway, with their highest concentration at the plasma membrane. How a cell succeeds in maintaining organelle-specific lipid compositions, despite a steady flow of incoming and outgoing transport carriers along the secretory pathway, is not yet clear. Transport and sorting along the secretory pathway of both proteins and most lipids are thought to be mediated by vesicular transport, with coat protein I (COPI) vesicles operating in the early secretory pathway. Although the protein constituents of these transport intermediates are characterized in great detail, much less is known about their lipid content. Using nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry for quantitative lipid analysis of COPI-coated vesicles and their parental Golgi membranes, we find only low amounts of sphingomyelin and cholesterol in COPI-coated vesicles compared with their donor Golgi membranes, providing evidence for a significant segregation from COPI vesicles of these lipids. In addition, our data indicate a sorting of individual sphingomyelin molecular species.

The authors impart physiological significance to this observation and propose to re-conceptualize the general role of NSF in fusion processes. We can confirm that isolated NSF can fuse liposomes of the specified composition. However, this activity of NSF is resistant to inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide and does not depend on the presence of α-SNAP (soluble NSF-attachment protein). Moreover, under the same conditions, either α-SNAP, other proteins apparently unrelated to vesicular transport (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or lactic dehydrogenase) or even 3 mM magnesium ions can also cause lipid mixing. In contrast, neither NSF nor the other proteins nor magnesium had any significant fusogenic activity with liposomes composed of a biologically occurring mixture of lipids. A straightforward explanation is that the lipid composition chosen as optimal for NSF favors non-specific fusion because it is physically unstable when formed into liposomes.

In an in vitro assay that reconstitutes intra-Golgi protein transport, we find that a membrane-bound and A1F4-sensitive factor is involved in the fusion reaction. To determine whether this effect is mediated by a heterotrimeric G protein localized to COPI-coated transport vesicles, we determined the presence of G proteins on these vesicles and found that they were segregated relative to the donor membranes. Because G proteins do not have an obvious sorting, retention, or retrieval signal, we considered the possibility that other interactions might be responsible for this segregation. In agreement with this, we found that trimeric G proteins from isolated Golgi membranes were partially insoluble in Triton X-100.

The cytoplasmic tail of CD8 was exchanged by a construct comprising a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope, the C-terminal sequence of the viral protein E19 (containing a KKXX retrieval signal) followed by a myc epitope (CD8-LT). Due to this masking of the KKXX retrieval signal CD8-LT is transported to the cell surface. Since the KKXX motif is joined to the myc epitope via a thrombin cleavage site, CD8-LT in isolated Golgi membranes can be proteolytically converted into an unmasked reporter molecule for retrograde transport (CD8-ST) in vitro. A CHO cell line stably expressing CD8-LT was generated and used for the isolation of Golgi membranes. These membranes were shown to contain CD8-LT en route to the cell surface. By addition of thrombin, CD8-LT could be efficiently converted into CD8-ST, and this allows us to study the sorting into coat protein COPI-coated vesicles of these different kinds of cargo on a comparative basis. COPI-coated vesicles were generated in vitro from Golgi membranes containing either CD8-LT or CD8-ST. When the incubation was performed in the presence of GTP, both CD8-LT and CD8-ST were packaged into COPI-coated vesicles. However, COPI-coated vesicles generated in the presence of the slowly hydrolyzable analogue of GTP, GTPγS contained strikingly lower amounts of CD8-LT and CD8-ST. While COPI-coated vesicles accumulated about 12-fold in the presence of GTPγS these vesicles together contained only one fifth of cargo compared to the few vesicles generated in the absence of GTPγS.

The cytoplasmic tail of p23 is shown to act as a functional retrieval signal as it confers endoplasmic reticulum (ER) residence to a CD8-p23 fusion protein. This ER localization is, at least in part, a result of retrieval from post-ER compartments because CD8-p23 fusion proteins receive post-ER modifications. In contrast, the cytoplasmic tail of p24 has been shown not to retrieve a CD8-p24 fusion protein. The coatomer binding motifs FF and KK in the cytoplasmic tail of p23 are reported to influence the steady-state localization of the CD8-p23 fusion protein within the ER-Golgi recycling pathway.

It has been speculated that forskolin interferes with the action of BFA by competition for the binding of BFA to its target protein, which is most likely the Golgi-localized nucleotide exchange factor specific for ADP- ribosylation factor 1. Here we show that in vitro forskolin does not prevent inhibition of Golgi-catalyzed nucleotide exchange by BFA. Therefore it appears unlikely that forskolin and BFA bind to the same target protein. Using [3H]BFA we have measured detoxification of BFA by Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. BFA is secreted from CHO cells as cysteine and glutathione conjugates (Bruning, A., Ishikawa, T., Kneusel, R. E., Matern, U., Lottspeich, F., and Wieland, F. T. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 7726-7732). We present evidence that forskolin treatment of CHO cells results in increased levels of Cys-BFA, the major BFA conjugate secreted by CHO cells, in the medium. Elevated levels of Cys-BFA are also found intracellularly. The effect of forskolin is shown to be independent of its ability to raise the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP.

Using this procedure, the vesicles were separated from plasma membranes, Golgi, trans-Golgi network (TGN), ER, endosomes, lysosomes, transcytotic vesicles, and mitochondria. The diameter of these vesicles was ~100-200 nm as determined by electron microscopy. A typical coat structure as described for intra-Golgi transport vesicles or clathrin-coated vesicles could not be seen, and the vesicles were not associated with the coat protein β-COP. Furthermore, the vesicles appear to represent a low density compartment (1.05-1.06 g/ml). Other constitutively secreted proteins (rat serum albumin, apolipoprotein E, and fibrinogen) could not be detected in purified HSPG- carrying vesicles, but banded in the denser fractions of the Nycodenz gradient. Moreover, during pulse-chase labeling with [35S]methionine, labeled albumin did not appear in the post-TGN vesicle fraction carrying HSPGs. These findings indicate sorting of HSPGs and albumin into different types of constitutive secretory vesicles in hepatocytes. Two proteins were found to be tightly associated with the membranes of the HSPG carrying vesicles: a member of the ADP ribosylation factor family of small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins and an unknown 14-kD peripheral membrane protein (VAPP14). Concerning the secretory pathway, we conclude from these results that ADP ribosylation factor proteins are not only involved in vesicular transport from the ER via the Golgi to the TGN, but also in vesicular transport from the TGN to the plasma membrane.",,34,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,1994-05-01

DNA polymerase α was shown to incorporate azidothymidine monophosphate into a growing polynucleotide chain. This occurred 2000-fold slower than the incorporation of natural dTTP. Despite the ability of polymerase α to use azidothymidine triphosphate as an alternate substrate, this compound was only marginally inhibitory to the enzyme (K(i) > 1 mM). Furthermore, the DNA primase activity associated with DNA polymerase α was barely inhibited by azidothymidine triphosphate (K(i) > 1 mM). Inhibition was more pronounced for DNA polymerases δ and ε. The type of inhibition was competitive with respect to dTTP, with K(i) values of 250 and 320 μM, respectively. No incorporation of azidothymidine monophosphate was detectable with these two DNA polymerases because their associated 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activities degraded primer molecules prior to any measurable elongation. Template-primer systems with a preformed 3'-azidothymidine-containing primer terminus inhibited the three replicative polymerases rather potently. DNA polymerase α was inhibited with a K(i) of 150 nM and polymerases δ and ε with K(i) values of 25 and 20 nM, respectively. The type of inhibition was competitive with respect to the unmodified substrate poly(dA)·oligo(dT) for all DNA polymerases tested. Preformed 3'-azidothymidine-containing primers hybridized to poly(dA) were rather resistant to degradation by the 3'- to 5'-exonuclease of DNA polymerases ε and more susceptible to the analogous activity that copurified with DNA polymerase δ. It is proposed that the repair of 3'-azidothymidine-containing primers might become rate-limiting for the process of DNA replication in cells that have been treated with azidothymidine triphosphate.",,53,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,1992-01-01

Identification of inhibitors of NLRP3 activation requires a well-validated primary high-throughput assay followed by the deployment of a screening cascade of assays enabling studies of structure–activity relationship, compound selectivity and efficacy in disease models. We optimized a NLRP3-dependent fluorescent tagged ASC speck formation assay in murine immortalized bone marrow-derived macrophages and utilized it to screen a compound library of 81,000 small molecules. Our high-content screening assay yielded robust assay metrics and identified a number of inhibitors of NLRP3-dependent ASC speck formation, including compounds targeting HSP90, JAK and IKK-β. Additional assays to investigate inflammasome priming or activation, NLRP3 downstream effectors such as caspase-1, IL-1β and pyroptosis form the basis of a screening cascade to identify NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors in drug discovery programs.",,0,1,ARUK,ARUK-2015DDI-OX,Alzheimer’s Research UK,papers by authors,2,2021-12-01

In primary monocytes, in response to LPS, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is characterized by an independence of K+ efflux and ASC speck formation and has been termed the ‘alternative’ pathway. Here, we report that pharmacological inhibition of V-ATPase with bafilomycin A1 exacerbated LPS-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in primary human monocytes. Inhibition of V-ATPase in the presence of extracellular LPS led to NLRP3-dependent, K+ efflux-independent, ASC oligomerization and caspase-1 activation. Although V-ATPases are required for lysosomal acidification, we found that acidic lysosomal pH and protease activity were dispensable for this altered response, suggesting that V-ATPase inhibition triggered alternative signalling events. Therefore, V-ATPases may serve additional roles during NLRP3 inflammasome activation in primary human monocytes.",alternative NLRP3 inflammasome | caspase 1 | cytokine | immune cell | immunology | inflammasome | inflammation | interleukin 1 | monocyte | NLRP3,0,1,MRC,201608060031,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2021-05-01

Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is used to evaluate and recondition extended criteria donor lungs for transplantation. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been identified as a prognostic indicator of nonrecovery during EVLP. This may be an effect of inflammasome activation or cellular necrosis following donation and graft preservation. Delineating the mechanism of IL-1β release is required. Methods. The inactive intracellular precursor molecule, pro-IL-1β, was characterized along with the pro-IL-1β processing enzyme, caspase-1, in the perfusate of n = 20 human lungs that had undergone EVLP (n = 10 lungs that failed to recover and were discarded versus n = 10 lungs that reconditioned and were transplanted). In an experimental porcine model, n = 8 lungs underwent EVLP and were randomized to receive either a specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor or control. Results. Significant increases in pro-IL-1β and caspase-1 were observed in the perfusate from human lungs that did not recondition during EVLP compared with those that successfully reconditioned and were used for transplantation. Within the porcine EVLP, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition reduced IL-1β within the perfusate compared with controls, but this had no impact on lung function, hemodynamics, or inflammation. Conclusions. Our data suggest that pro-IL-1β is passively released following cellular necrosis of the donor lung.",,0,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2021-01-01

In addition, NLRP3-inflammasome-activating stimuli trigger diverse posttranslational modifications of NLRP3 that are important in controlling its activation.

We find that in P14 Cdk1Liv-/- mice, where the division of hepatocytes is abolished, polyploidy, DNA damage, and increased p53 signaling are prevalent. Cdk1Liv-/- mice display classical markers of liver damage two weeks after birth, including elevated ALT, ALP, and bilirubin levels, despite the lack of exogenous liver injury. Inflammation was further studied using cytokine arrays, unveiling elevated levels of CCL2, TIMP1, CXCL10, and IL1-Rn in Cdk1Liv-/- liver, which resulted in increased numbers of monocytes. Ablation of CDK2-dependent DNA re-replication and polyploidy in Cdk1Liv-/- mice reversed most of these phenotypes. Overall, our data indicate that blocking hepatocyte division induces biological processes driving the onset of the disease phenotype.

Clinical prediction models play a critical role in this process, but current models are of limited value because they are typically restricted to baseline predictors and do not always use contemporary statistical methods. We sought to explore the benefits of incorporating dynamic changes in routinely measured biomarkers, non-linear effects and applying 'state-of-the-art' statistical methods in the development of a prognostic model to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: The data were analysed from admissions with COVID-19 to three hospital sites. Exploratory data analysis included a graphical approach to partial correlations. Dynamic biomarkers were considered up to 5 days following admission rather than depending solely on baseline or single time-point data. Marked departures from linear effects of covariates were identified by employing smoothing splines within a generalised additive modelling framework. SETTING: 3 secondary and tertiary level centres in Greater Manchester, the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 392 hospitalised patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: 392 patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increased from 0.73 using admission data alone to 0.75 when also considering results of baseline blood samples and to 0.83 when considering dynamic values of routinely collected markers. There was clear non-linearity in the association of age with patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that clinical prediction models to predict death in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 can be improved by taking into account both non-linear effects in covariates such as age and dynamic changes in values of biomarkers.",intensive &amp; critical care | respiratory infections | statistics &amp; research methods,2,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2020-09-01

Patients develop behavioural disturbances and cognitive decline, a possible consequence of neuroinflammation and abnormal substrate accumulation. Interleukin (IL)-1β and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) expression were significantly increased in both murine models and human MPSIII patients. We identified pathogenic mechanisms of inflammasome activation, including that disease-specific 2-O-sulphated heparan sulphate was essential for priming an IL-1β response via the Toll-like receptor 4 complex. However, mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA primary and secondary storage substrates, such as amyloid beta, were both required to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and initiate IL-1β secretion. IL-1 blockade in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA mice using IL-1 receptor type 1 knockout or haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy over-expressing IL-1Ra reduced gliosis and completely prevented behavioural phenotypes. In conclusion, we demonstrate that IL-1 drives neuroinflammation, behavioural abnormality and cognitive decline in mucopolysaccharidosis IIIA, highlighting haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy treatment with IL-1Ra as a potential neuronopathic lysosomal disease treatment.",cognitive decline | haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy | inflammasome | interleukin-1 receptor antagonist | mucopolysaccharidosis,7,1,WT,undefined,Shire,papers by authors,0,2020-03-01

Far from a homogenous proliferation of Schwann cells, mounting evidence has highlighted the complex nature of the inflammatory microenvironment in these tumors. Methods A review of the literature pertaining to inflammation, inflammatory molecular pathways, and immune-related therapeutic targets in VS was performed. Relevant studies published up to June 2020 were identified based on a literature search in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases and the findings were synthesized into a concise narrative review of the topic. Results The VS microenvironment is characterized by a dense infiltrate of inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages. Significantly higher levels of immune cell infiltration are observed in growing versus static tumors, and there is a demonstrable interplay between inflammation and angiogenesis in growing VS. While further mechanistic studies are required to ascertain the exact role of inflammation in angiogenesis, tumor growth, and Schwann cell control, we are beginning to understand the key molecular pathways driving this inflammatory microenvironment, and how these processes can be monitored and targeted in vivo. Conclusion Observational research has revealed a complex and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment in VS. The functional landscape and roles of macrophages and other immune cells in the VS inflammatory infiltrate are, however, yet to be established. The antiangiogenic drug bevacizumab has shown the efficacy of targeted molecular therapies in VS and there is hope that agents targeting another major component of the VS microenvironment, inflammation, will also find a place in their future management.",angiogenesis | antiangiogenic | bevacizumab | biomarkers | immunomodulation | immunotherapy | inflammation | tumor immunology | tumor-associated macrophages | vestibular schwannoma,1,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2020-01-01

Objective: We aim to demonstrate the applicability of GO for interpretation of AD datasets to improve the understanding of the underlying molecular disease mechanisms, including the involvement of inflammatory pathways and dysregulated microRNAs (miRs). Methods: We have undertaken a systematic full article GO annotation approach focused on microglial proteins implicated in AD and the miRs regulating their expression. PANTHER was used for enrichment analysis of previously published AD data. Cytoscape was used for visualizing and analyzing miR-target interactions captured from published experimental evidence. Results: We contributed 3,084 new annotations for 494 entities, i.e., on average six new annotations per entity. This included a total of 1,352 annotations for 40 prioritized microglial proteins implicated in AD and 66 miRs regulating their expression, yielding an average of twelve annotations per prioritized entity. The updated GO resource was then used to re-analyze previously published data. The re-analysis showed novel processes associated with AD-related genes, not identified in the original study, such as 'gliogenesis', 'regulation of neuron projection development', or 'response to cytokine', demonstrating enhanced applicability of GO for neuroscience research. Conclusions: This study highlights ongoing development of the neurobiological aspects of GO and demonstrates the value of biocuration activities in the area, thus helping to delineate the molecular bases of AD to aid the development of diagnostic tools and treatments.",Alzheimer's disease | Cytoscape network analysis | Gene Ontology | microglia | neuroinflammation | PANTHER,5,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2020-01-01

We previously showed that Ym1, an alternative activation marker, can drive innate IL-1R-dependent neutrophil recruitment during infection with the lung-migrating nematode, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, suggesting a potential role for the inflammasome in the IL-1-mediated innate response to infection. Although inflammasome proteins such as NLRP3 have important proinflammatory functions in macrophages, their role during type 2 responses and repair are less defined. We therefore infected Nlrp3-/- mice with N. brasiliensis. Unexpectedly, compared with wild-type (WT) mice, infected Nlrp3-/- mice had increased neutrophilia and eosinophilia, correlating with enhanced worm killing but at the expense of increased tissue damage and delayed lung repair. Transcriptional profiling showed that infected Nlrp3-/- mice exhibited elevated type 2 gene expression compared with WT mice. Notably, inflammasome activation was not evident early postinfection with N. brasiliensis, and in contrast to Nlrp3-/- mice, antihelminth responses were unaffected in caspase-1/11-deficient or WT mice treated with the NLRP3-specific inhibitor MCC950. Together these data suggest that NLRP3 has a role in constraining lung neutrophilia, helminth killing, and type 2 immune responses in an inflammasome-independent manner.",,7,1,WT,106898/A/15/Z,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,0,2019-11-01

cumbersome and time-consuming traditional embryonic stem cell-based methods. An earlier study reported up to 16% efficiency in generating conditional knockout (cKO or floxed) alleles by microinjection of 2 single guide RNAs (sgRNA) and 2 single-stranded oligonucleotides as donors (referred herein as ""two-donor floxing"" method). Results: We re-evaluate the two-donor method from a consortium of 20 laboratories across the world. The dataset constitutes 56 genetic loci, 17,887 zygotes, and 1718 live-born mice, of which only 15 (0.87%) mice contain cKO alleles. We subject the dataset to statistical analyses and a machine learning algorithm, which reveals that none of the factors analyzed was predictive for the success of this method. We test some of the newer methods that use one-donor DNA on 18 loci for which the two-donor approach failed to produce cKO alleles. We find that the one-donor methods are 10- to 20-fold more efficient than the two-donor approach. Conclusion: We propose that the two-donor method lacks efficiency because it relies on two simultaneous recombination events in cis, an outcome that is dwarfed by pervasive accompanying undesired editing events. The methods that use one-donor DNA are fairly efficient as they rely on only one recombination event, and the probability of correct insertion of the donor cassette without unanticipated mutational events is much higher. Therefore, one-donor methods offer higher efficiencies for the routine generation of cKO animal models.",Conditional knockout mouse | CRISPR-Cas9 | Floxed allele | Homology-directed repair | Long single-stranded DNA | Machine learning | Mouse | Oligonucleotide | Reproducibility | Transgenesis,19,1,NIH,CZ.1.05/2.1.00/19.0395,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2019-08-01

The lack of relevant non-transgenic preclinical models reflective of disease progression is one of the main factors hindering the discovery of effective drug treatments. To this end, we have developed a protocol for the fabrication of alginate microbeads containing amyloid-secreting cells useful for the study of the effects of chronic Aβ production. Chinese hamster ovary cells previously transfected with a human APP gene, secreting Aβ (i.e., 7PA2 cells), were used in this study. A three-dimensional (3D) in vitro model for the sustained release of Aβ was fabricated by encapsulation of 7PA2 cells in alginate. The process was optimized to target a bead diameter of 500-600 μm for further in vivo studies. Optimization of 7PA2 cell encapsulation in alginate was performed altering fabrication parameters, e.g., alginate concentration, gel flow rate, electrostatic potential, head vibration frequency, gelling solution. Levels of secreted Aβ were analyzed over time and compared between alginate beads and standard cell culture methods (up to 96 h). A concentration of 1.5 x 106 7PA2 cells/mL and an alginate concentration of 2% (w/v) buffered with HEPES and subsequent gelation in 0.5 M calcium chloride for 5 min were found to fabricate the most stable microbeads. Fabricated microbeads were 1) of uniform size, 2) with an average diameter of 550 μm, 3) containing about 100-150 cells per microbead and 4) able to secrete Aβ. In conclusion, our optimized method for the production of stable alginate microbeads containing amyloid-producing 7PA2 cells might enable the modeling of important aspects of AD both in vitro and in vivo.",3D in vitro models | Alginate | Alzheimer's disease | Amyloid | Aβ | Biology | Controlled release | Encapsulation | Hydrogels | Issue 149,1,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2019-07-01

Inflammasomes are multimolecular protein complexes that drive inflammation through activation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL (interleukin)-1β. Preclinical evidence suggests that IL-1β contributes to a worsening of ischemic brain injury. Methods - Using a mouse middle cerebral artery thrombosis model, we examined the inflammatory response after stroke and the contribution of the NLRP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome to ischemic injury. Results - There was a marked inflammatory response after stroke characterized by increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines and NLRP3 and by recruitment of leukocytes to the injured tissue. Targeting NLRP3 with the inhibitor MCC950, or using mice in which NLRP3 was knocked out, had no effect on the extent of injury caused by stroke. Conclusions - These data suggest that the NLRP3 pathway does not contribute to the inflammation exacerbating ischemic brain damage, contradicting several recent reports to the contrary.",brain | cytokine | inflammasome | inflammation | interleukin,18,1,WT,106898/A/15/Z,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,1,2019-05-01

In this context, therapeutic interventions aimed at protectively modulating host responses, to enhance defence against infection, take on ever greater significance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important multidrug-resistant, opportunistic respiratory pathogen, the clearance of which can be enhanced in vivo by the innate immune modulatory properties of antimicrobial host defence peptides from the cathelicidin family, including human LL-37. Initially described primarily as bactericidal agents, cathelicidins are now recognised as multifunctional antimicrobial immunomodulators, modifying host responses to pathogens, but the key mechanisms involved in these protective functions are not yet defined. We demonstrate that P. aeruginosa infection of airway epithelial cells promotes extensive infected cell internalisation of LL-37, in a manner that is dependent upon epithelial cell interaction with live bacteria, but does not require bacterial Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS). Internalised LL-37 acts as a second signal to induce inflammasome activation in airway epithelial cells, which, in contrast to myeloid cells, are relatively unresponsive to P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that this is mechanistically dependent upon cathepsin B release, and NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase 1. These result in LL-37-mediated release of IL-1â and IL-18 in a manner that is synergistic with P. aeruginosa infection, and can induce caspase 1-dependent death of infected epithelial cells, and promote neutrophil chemotaxis. We propose that cathelicidin can therefore act as a second signal, required by P. aeruginosa infected epithelial cells to promote an inflammasome-mediated altruistic cell death of infection-compromised epithelial cells and act as a ""fire alarm"" to enhance rapid escalation of protective inflammatory responses to an uncontrolled infection. Understanding this novel modulatory role for cathelicidins, has the potential to inform development of novel therapeutic strategies to antibiotic-resistant pathogens, harnessing innate immunity as a complementation or alternative to current interventions.",,17,1,MRC,G1002046,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,3,2019-01-01

However, how GO interacts with biological systems, including the innate immune system, is poorly understood. Here, we elucidate the effects of GO sheets on macrophages, identifying distinctive effects of GO on the inflammatory phenotype. Small, thin (s)-GO dose-dependently inhibited release of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 but not tumor necrosis factor α. NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1 activation was not affected. The effect of s-GO was pretranslational, as s-GO blocked Toll-like receptor 4-dependent expression of Il1b and Il6 but not Nlrp3 or Tnf mRNA transcripts. s-GO was internalized by immortalized bone-marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting a potential intracellular action. Uptake of polystyrene beads with similar lateral dimensions and surface charge did not phenocopy the effects of s-GO, suggesting that s-GO-mediated inhibition of interleukin expression was not simply due to particle phagocytosis. RNA-Seq analysis established that s-GO had profound effects on the immunometabolism of the cells, leading to activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, which inhibited expression of cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6. Thus, we have identified immunometabolic effects of GO that reveal another dimension to its effects on cells.

Biological knowledge presented in the scientific literature was captured through the association of GO terms with dementia-relevant protein records; GO itself was revised, and new GO terms were added. This literature biocuration increased the number of Alzheimer’s-relevant gene products that were being associated with neurological GO terms, such as ‘amyloid-beta clearance’ or ‘learning or memory’, as well as neuronal structures and their compartments. Of the total 2055 annotations that we contributed for the prioritised gene products, 526 have associated proteins and complexes with neurological GO terms.

Assessed using ASC inflammasome-speck formation, and release of IL-1β, in both human monocyte/macrophage THP1 cells and in primary mouse microglia, we compared the relative potency and selectivity of P2X7 inhibitors, inflammasome inhibitors (diarylsulfonylurea vs. the NBC series), and caspase-1 inhibitors. In doing so we are now able to provide a well characterised small molecule tool kit for interrogating and validating inflammasome-dependent responses with a range of nanomolar potency inhibitors against established points in the inflammasome pathway.",,14,1,MRC,ARUK-DC2017-1,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,6,2018-12-01

Currently, the only treatment for CM is the provision of antimalarial drugs; however, such treatment by itself often fails to prevent death or development of neurological sequelae. To identify potential improved treatments for CM, we performed a nonbiased whole-brain transcriptomic time-course analysis of antimalarial drug chemotherapy of murine experimental CM (ECM). Bioinformatics analyses revealed IL33 as a critical regulator of neuroinflammation and cerebral pathology that is down-regulated in the brain during fatal ECM and in the acute period following treatment of ECM. Consistent with this, administration of IL33 alongside antimalarial drugs significantly improved the treatment success of established ECM. Mechanistically, IL33 treatment reduced inflammasome activation and IL1β production in microglia and intracerebral monocytes in the acute recovery period following treatment of ECM. Moreover, treatment with the NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 alongside antimalarial drugs phenocopied the protective effect of IL33 therapy in improving the recovery from established ECM. We further showed that IL1β release from macrophages was stimulated by hemozoin and antimalarial drugs and that this was inhibited by MCC950. Our results therefore demonstrate that manipulation of the IL33–NLRP3 axis may be an effective therapy to suppress neuroinflammation and improve the efficacy of antimalarial drug treatment of CM.",IL33 | Inflammasome | Inflammation | Malaria | NLRP3,21,1,NIAID,R01AI079293,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,1,2018-07-01

Direct, noninvasive monitoring of inflammation in the human brain after ICH will facilitate early-phase development of anti-inflammatory treatments. We sought to investigate the feasibility of multimodality brain imaging in subacute ICH. METHODS: Acute ICH patients were recruited to undergo multiparametric MRI (including dynamic contrast-enhanced measurement of blood-brain barrier transfer constant (Ktrans) and PET with [11C]-(R)-PK11195). [11C]-(R)-PK11195 binds to the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), which is rapidly upregulated in activated microglia. Circulating inflammatory markers were measured at the time of PET. RESULTS: Five patients were recruited to this feasibility study with imaging between 5 and 16 days after onset. Etiologies included hypertension-related small vessel disease, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), cavernoma, and arteriovenous malformation (AVM). [11C]-(R)-PK11195 binding was low in all hematomas and 2 (patient 2 [probable CAA] and 4 [AVM]) cases showed widespread increase in binding in the perihematomal region versus contralateral. All had increased Ktrans in the perihematomal region (mean difference = 2.2 × 10−3 minute−1; SD = 1.6 × 10−3 minute−1) versus contralateral. Two cases (patients 1 [cavernoma] and 4 [AVM]) had delayed surgery (3 and 12 months post-onset, respectively) with biopsies showing intense microglial activation in perilesional tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates for the first time the feasibility of performing complex multimodality brain imaging for noninvasive monitoring of neuroinflammation for this severe stroke subtype.",blood-brain barrier | inflammation | Intracerebral hemorrhage | magnetic resonance imaging | positron emission tomography,11,0,MRC,MR/N003586/1,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2018-03-01

The classical hall marks of Alzheimer's disease include the accumulation of amyloid oligomers and fibrils, and the intracellular formation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau. It is now clear that inflammation also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease through a number of neurotoxic mechanisms. Microglia are the key immune regulators of the CNS which detect amyloidopathy through cell surface and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and respond by initiating inflammation through the secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Inflammasomes, which regulate IL-1β release, are formed following activation of cytosolic PRRs, and using genetic and pharmacological approaches, NLRP3 and NLRP1 inflammasomes have been found to be integral in pathogenic neuroinflammation in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the inflammasomes are very promising novel pharmacological targets which merit further research in the continued endeavor for efficacious therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's disease | inflammasomes | inflammation,63,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2017-03-01

Inflammatory processes are associated with the aetiology and clinical progression of migraine, psychiatric conditions, epilepsy, cerebrovascular diseases, dementia and neurodegeneration, such as seen in Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. Both central and systemic inflammatory actions have been linked with the development of brain diseases, suggesting that complex neuro-immune interactions could contribute to pathological changes in the brain across multiple temporal and spatial scales. However, the mechanisms through which inflammation impacts on neurological disease are improperly defined. To develop effective therapeutic approaches, it is imperative to understand how detrimental inflammatory processes could be blocked selectively, or controlled for prolonged periods, without compromising essential immune defence mechanisms. Increasing evidence indicates that common risk factors for brain disorders, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, obesity or infection involve the activation of NLRP3, NLRP1, NLRC4 or AIM2 inflammasomes, which are also associated with various neurological diseases. This review focuses on the mechanisms whereby inflammasomes, which integrate diverse inflammatory signals in response to pathogen-driven stimuli, tissue injury or metabolic alterations in multiple cell types and different organs of the body, could functionally link vascular- and neurological diseases and hence represent a promising therapeutic target.",brain disease | inflammasome | Inflammation | neurodegeneration | systemic,83,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2016-10-01

Inappropriate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the progression of many noncommunicable diseases such as gout, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Inhibiting the inflammasome may significantly reduce damaging inflammation and is therefore regarded as a therapeutic target.

The main focus of this investigation was to compare P2X7R-driven IL-1 production by primary murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) and macrophages (BMM). P2X7R expression in murine BMDC and BMM at both transcriptional (P2X7A variant) and protein levels was demonstrated. Priming with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and receptor activation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) resulted in markedly enhanced IL-1 (α and β) secretion in BMDC compared with BMM. In both cell types IL-1 production was profoundly inhibited with a P2X7R-specific inhibitor (A-740003) demonstrating that this release is predominantly a P2X7R-dependent process.

Both cell types expressed constitutively the gain-of-function P2X7K as well as the full P2X7A variant at equivalent levels. LPS priming reduced significantly levels of P2X7A but not P2X7K transcripts in both BMDC and BMM. P2X7R-induced pore formation, assessed by YO-PRO-1 dye uptake, was greater in BMDC, and these cells were protected from cell death.

What advances does it highlight? Here we highlight recent advances on the role and regulation of inflammasomes, and the latest clinical progress in targeting inflammation. Acute brain injury is one of the leading causes of mortality and disability worldwide. Despite this, treatments for acute brain injuries are limited, and there remains a massive unmet clinical need. Inflammation has emerged as a major contributor to non-communicable diseases, and there is now substantial and growing evidence that inflammation, driven by the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), worsens acute brain injury. Interleukin-1 is regulated by large, multimolecular complexes called inflammasomes. Here, we discuss the latest research on the regulation of inflammasomes and IL-1 in the brain, preclinical efforts to establish the IL-1 system as a therapeutic target, and the promise of recent and future clinical studies on blocking the action of IL-1 for the treatment of brain injury.",,16,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2015-12-01

IL-1 is a driver of inflammation and implicated in many noncommunicable diseases. Acidosis is also a key feature of the inflammatory microenvironment; therefore it is vital to explore IL-1 signaling under acidic conditions. A HEK-IL-1 reporter assay and brain endothelial cell line were used to explore activity of mature IL-1α and IL-1β at pH 7.4 and pH 6.2, an acidic pH that can be reached under inflammatory or ischemic conditions, alongside cathepsin D-cleaved 20-kDa IL-1β produced under acidic conditions. We report that mature IL-1 signaling at IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) is maintained at pH 6.2, but the activity of the decoy receptor, IL-1R2, is reduced. Additionally, cathepsin D-cleaved 20-kDa IL-1β was minimally active at IL-1R1 and was not further cleaved to highly active 17-kDa IL-1β. Therefore formation of the 20-kDa form of IL-1β may prevent the generation of mature bioactive IL-1β and thus may limit inflammation.",,9,1,BBSRC,undefined,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council,papers by authors,1,2015-10-01

This commentary discusses three papers in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology that advance our understanding of the roles of caspase-11, -4, and -5 in the noncanonical pathway. By utilizing the new gene editing technique, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), as well as sensitive cell imaging techniques, these papers establish that cytoplasmic LPS-dependent IL-1β production requires the NLRP3 inflammasome and that its activation is dependent on K+ efflux, whereas IL-1α release and pyroptotic cell death pathways are NLRP3-independent. These findings expand on previous research implicating K+ efflux as the principal trigger for NLRP3 activation and suggest that canonical and noncanonical NLRP3 pathways are not as dissimilar as first thought.",Caspase-11 | Caspase-4 | Caspase-5 | LPS | NLRP3 inflammasome | Noncanonical | Pyroptosis,30,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2015-10-01

Previous research efforts have focussed on the biology and contribution of IL-1β. However, we now recognise that IL-1α is an early and important mediator of inflammation after injury. This review focuses on what is known about IL-1α, its regulation and its contribution to brain injury.

Here, using a rodent model of stroke, we show that the NLRC4 (NLR family, CARD domain containing 4) and AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasomes contribute to brain injury. We also show that acute ischemic brain injury is regulated by mechanisms that require ASC (apoptosis-associated specklike protein containing a CARD), a common adaptor protein for several inflammasomes, and that the NLRP3 (NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome is not involved in this process.

Thus, besides developing direct immunostimulatory regimens, including dendritic cell-based vaccines, checkpoint-blocking therapies, and adoptive T-cell transfer, researchers have started to focus on the overall immunobiology of neoplastic cells. It is now clear that cancer cells can succumb to some anticancer therapies by undergoing a peculiar form of cell death that is characterized by an increased immunogenic potential, owing to the emission of the so-called ""damage-associated molecular patterns"" (DAMPs). The emission of DAMPs and other immunostimulatory factors by cells succumbing to immunogenic cell death (ICD) favors the establishment of a productive interface with the immune system. This results in the elicitation of tumor-targeting immune responses associated with the elimination of residual, treatment-resistant cancer cells, as well as with the establishment of immunological memory. Although ICD has been characterized with increased precision since its discovery, several questions remain to be addressed. Here, we summarize and tabulate the main molecular, immunological, preclinical, and clinical aspects of ICD, in an attempt to capture the essence of this phenomenon, and identify future challenges for this rapidly expanding field of investigation.",Anti-tumor immunity | Immunogenicity | Immunotherapy | Molecular medicine | Oncoimmunology | Patient prognosis | Translational medicine,210,1,H2020,G.0584.12N,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,papers by authors,3,2015-01-01

The secretion of these cytokines by dendritic cells (DC) is integral to the development of proinflammatory responses. These cytokines are not secreted via the classical secretory pathway. Instead, 2 independent processes are required; an initial signal to induce up-regulation of the precursor pro-IL-1α and -β, and a second signal to drive cleavage and consequent secretion. Pro- IL-1α and -β are both cytosolic and thus, are potentially subject to post-translational modifications. These modifications may, in turn, have a functional outcome in the context of IL-1α and -β secretion and hence inflammation. We report here that IL-1α and -β were degraded intracellularly in murine bone marrowderived DC and that this degradation was dependent on active cellular processes. In addition, we demonstrate that degradation was ablated when the proteasome was inhibited, whereas autophagy did not appear to play a major role. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasome led to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated IL-1α and -β, indicating that IL-1α and -β were polyubiquitinated prior to proteasomal degradation. Finally, our investigations suggest that polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are not continuous processes but instead are up-regulated following DC activation. Overall, these data highlight that IL-1α and -β polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are central mechanisms in the regulation of intracellular IL-1 levels in DC.",,30,1,MRC,undefined,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2014-12-01

dead cell-associated antigens. However, multiple stimuli can trigger a functionally peculiar type of apoptotic demise that does not go unnoticed by the adaptive arm of the immune system, which we named “immunogenic cell death” (ICD). ICD is preceded or accompanied by the emission of a series of immunostimulatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in a precise spatiotemporal configuration. Several anticancer agents that have been successfully employed in the clinic for decades, including various chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy, can elicit ICD. Moreover, defects in the components that underlie the capacity of the immune system to perceive cell death as immunogenic negatively influence disease outcome among cancer patients treated with ICD inducers. Thus, ICD has profound clinical and therapeutic implications. Unfortunately, the gold-standard approach to detect ICD relies on vaccination experiments involving immunocompetent murine models and syngeneic cancer cells, an approach that is incompatible with large screening campaigns. Here, we outline strategies conceived to detect surrogate markers of ICD in vitro and to screen large chemical libraries for putative ICD inducers, based on a high-content, high-throughput platform that we recently developed. Such a platform allows for the detection of multiple DAMPs, like cell surface-exposed calreticulin, extracellular ATP and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and/or the processes that underlie their emission, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy and necrotic plasma membrane permeabilization. We surmise that this technology will facilitate the development of next-generation anticancer regimens, which kill malignant cells and simultaneously convert them into a cancer-specific therapeutic vaccine.",ATP release | Autophagy | Calreticulin | Endoplasmic reticulum stress | HMGB1 | Immunotherapy,455,1,ARC,undefined,Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer,papers by authors,1,2014-10-01

Processing of IL-1 precursor proteins to active cytokines commonly occurs through activation of proteases, notably caspases and calpains. These proteases are instrumental in cell death, and inflammation and cell death are closely associated, hence we sought to determine the impact of cell death pathways on IL-1 processing and release. We discovered that apoptotic regulation of caspase-8 specifically induced the processing and release of IL-1β. Conversely, necroptosis caused the processing and release of IL-1α, and this was independent of IL-1β processing and release. These data suggest that the mechanism through which an IL-1-expressing cell dies dictates the nature of the inflammatory mechanism that follows. These insights may allow modification of inflammation through the selective targeting of cell death mechanisms during disease. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

A number of disease-Associated danger molecules are known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. We show here that depletion of zinc from macrophages, a paradigm for zinc deficiency, also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces IL-1β secretion. Our data suggest that zinc depletion damages the integrity of lysosomes and that this event is important for NLRP3 activation.

Acute cerebrovascular disease is multifactorial with many mechanisms contributing to a complex pathophysiology. One of the major processes worsening disease severity and outcome is inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines of the interleukin (IL)-1 family are now known to drive damaging inflammatory processes in the brain. The aim of this review is to discuss the recent literature describing the role of IL-1 in acute cerebrovascular disease and to provide an update on our current understanding of the mechanisms of IL-1 production. We also discuss the recent literature where the effects of IL-1 have been targeted in animal models, thus reviewing potential future strategies that may limit the devastating effects of acute cerebrovascular disease. © 2013 Galea and Brough.",Caspase-1 | Cerebral ischemia | Inflammation | Interleukin-1 | Microglia | Stroke,49,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2013-08-01

It is not known if microglia, a resident brain macrophage population, polarizes in a similar way, and whether specific microglial phenotypes modulate cell death in response to brain injury. In this study, we show that both BV2-microglia and mouse bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were able to adopt different phenotypes after LPS (M1) or IL-4 (M2) treatment in vitro, but regulated cell death differently when added to mouse organotypic hippocampal brain slices. BMDMs induced cell death when added to control slices and exacerbated damage when combined with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), independently of their phenotype. In contrast, vehicle- and M2-BV2-microglia were protective against OGD-induced death. Direct treatment of brain slices with IL-4 (without cell addition) was protective against OGD and induced an M2 phenotype in the slice. In vivo, intracerebral injection of LPS or IL-4 in mice induced microglial phenotypes similar to the phenotypes observed in brain slices and in cultured cells. After injury induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion, microglial cells did not adopt classical M1/ M2 phenotypes, suggesting that another subtype of regulatory phenotype was induced. This study highlights functional differences between macrophages and microglia, in response to brain injury with fundamentally different outcomes, even if both populations were able to adopt M1 or M2 phenotypes. These data suggest that macrophages infiltrating the brain from the periphery after an injury may be cytotoxic, independently of their phenotype, while microglia may be protective. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Brain injury | Inflammation | Macrophages | microglia,100,0,MRC,G0802001,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2013-05-01

It is synthesized as an inactive precursor that is activated by the protease caspase-1 within a cytosolic molecular complex called the inflammasome. Assembly of this complex is triggered by a range of structurally diverse damage or pathogen associated stimuli, and the signaling pathways through which these act are poorly understood. Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can be reversed by deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs) that remove ubiquitin moieties from the protein thus modifying its fate. DUBs present specificity toward different ubiquitin chain topologies and are crucial for recycling ubiquitin molecules before protein degradation as well as regulating key cellular processes such as protein trafficking, gene transcription, and signaling.Wereport here that small molecule inhibitors of DUB activity inhibit inflammasome activation. Inhibition of DUBs blocked the processing and release of IL-1β in both mouse and human macrophages.DUBactivity was necessary for inflammasome association as DUB inhibition also impairedASColigomerization and caspase-1 activation without directly blocking caspase-1 activity.

A key feature of NLRP3-inflammasome dependent responses in vitro in macrophages is the requirement of an initial priming stimulus by a pathogen (PAMP), or damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) respectively. We sought to determine the inflammatory responses of NLRP3-activating DAMPs on brain derived mixed glial cells in the absence of an initial priming stimulus in vitro. In cultured mouse mixed glia the DAMPs ATP, monosodium urate, and calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals had no effect on the expression of IL-1α or IL-1β and induced release only when the cells were primed with a PAMP. In the absence of priming, these DAMPs did however induce inflammation via the production of IL-6 and CXCL1, and the release of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Furthermore, the acute phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) acted as a priming stimulus on glial cells resulting in levels of IL-1 expression comparable to those induced by the PAMP lipopolysaccharide. In vivo, after cerebral ischemia, IL-1 production contributed to increased IL-6 and CXCL1 since these cytokines were profoundly reduced in the ischemic hemispheres from IL-1α/β double KO mice, although injury-induced cytokine responses were not abolished.Thus, DAMPs augment brain inflammation by directly stimulating production of glial derived inflammatory mediators. This is markedly enhanced by DAMP-induced IL-1-release-dependent responses that require a sterile endogenous priming stimulus such as SAA. © 2012 Savage, Lopez-Castejon, Denes and Brough.",Caspase-1 | Cerebral ischemia | Inflammation | Interleukin-1 | NLRP3-inflammasome | Priming,121,1,FP7,201024,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,0,2012-12-01

Treatment options are limited and animal models of SAH do not always mimic key pathophysiological hallmarks of the disease, thus hindering development of new therapeutics. Inflammation is strongly associated with brain injury after SAH in animals and patients, and inhibition of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) represents a possible therapeutic target. Here we report that a rupture of the middle cerebral artery in the rat produces heterogeneous infarct patterns similar to those observed in human SAH. Administration of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) reduced blood-brain barrier breakdown, and the extent of breakdown correlated with brain injury. After SAH, haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was strongly expressed around the bleed site and in the cortex and striatum, indicating the presence of free haem, a breakdown product of haemoglobin. HO-1 expression was also found in the same regions as microglial/macrophage expression of IL-1α. The direct effect of haem on IL-1α expression was confirmed in vitro using organotypic slice culture (OSC). Haem-induced cell death was dependent on IL-1 signalling, with IL-1Ra completely blocking cellular injury. Furthermore, stimulation of mouse primary mixed glial cells with haem induced the release of IL-1α, but not IL-1β. Thus, we suggest that haem, released from lysed red blood cells (RBCs) in the subarachnoid space, acts as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) driving IL-1-dependent inflammation. These data provide new insights into inflammation after SAH-induced brain injury and suggest IL-1Ra as a candidate therapeutic for the disease.",,83,1,MRC,G0801040,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2012-11-01

Genetic animal models of obesity (ob/ob and db/db mice) display altered centrally-mediated sickness behaviour in response to acute inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, the effect of diet-induced obesity (DIO) on the anorectic and febrile response to LPS in mice is unknown. This study therefore determined how DIO and ob/ob mice respond to a systemic inflammatory challenge. C57BL/6 DIO and ob/ob mice, and their respective controls, were given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS. Compared with controls, DIO and ob/ob mice exhibited an altered febrile response to LPS (100 μg/kg) over 8 hours. LPS caused a greater and more prolonged anorexic effect in DIO compared with control mice and, in ob/ob mice, LPS induced a reduction in food intake and body weight earlier than it did in controls. These effects of LPS in obese mice were also seen after a fixed dose of LPS (5 μg). LPS (100 μg/kg) induced Fos protein expression in several brain nuclei of control mice, with fewer Fos-positive cells observed in the brains of obese mice. An altered inflammatory response to LPS was also observed in obese mice compared with controls: changes in cytokine expression and release were detected in the plasma, spleen, liver and peritoneal macrophages in obese mice. In summary, DIO and ob/ob mice displayed an altered behavioural response and cytokine release to systemic inflammatory challenge. These findings could help explain why obese humans show increased sensitivity to infections. © 2012. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.",,56,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,5,2012-09-01

Thus, caspase-1 is regarded as a key mediator of inflammatory processes, and has become synonymous with inflammation. In addition to the processing of IL-1b, caspase-1 also executes a rapid programme of cell death, termed pyroptosis, in macrophages in response to intracellular bacteria. Pyroptosis is also regarded as a host response to remove the niche of the bacteria and to hasten their demise. These processes are generally accepted as the main roles of caspase-1. However, there is also a wealth of literature supporting a direct role for caspase-1 in non-infectious cell death processes. This is true in mammals, but also in nonmammalian vertebrates where caspase-1-dependent processing of IL-1b is absent because of the lack of appropriate caspase-1 cleavage sites. This literature is most prevalent in the brain where caspase-1 may directly regulate neuronal cell death in response to diverse insults. We attempt here to summarise the evidence for caspase-1 as a cell death enzyme and propose that, in addition to the processing of IL-1b, caspase-1 has an important and a conserved role as a cell death protease. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",caspase-1 | inflammasome | inflammation,174,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,4,2012-07-01

Following invasion L. monocytogenes escapes the phagosome and replicates in the cytoplasm. Phagosome escape is central to L. monocytogenes virulence and is required for initiating innate host-defence responses such as the secretion of the cytokine interleukin-1. Phagosome escape of L. monocytogenes is reported to depend upon host proteins such as γ-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The host cytosolic cysteine protease calpain is required in the life cycle of numerous pathogens, and previous research reports an activation of calpain by L. monocytogenes infection. Thus we sought to determine whether host calpain was required for the virulence of L. monocytogenes. Treatment of macrophages with calpain inhibitors blocked escape of L. monocytogenes from the phagosome and consequently its proliferation within the cytosol. This was independent of any direct effect on the production of bacterial virulence factors or of a bactericidal effect. Furthermore, the secretion of interleukin-1β, a host cytokine whose secretion induced by L. monocytogenes depends upon phagosome escape, was also blocked by calpain inhibition. These data indicate that L. monocytogenes co-opts host calpain to facilitate its escape from the phagosome, and more generally, that calpain may represent a cellular Achilles heel exploited by pathogens. © 2012 Lopez-Castejon et al.",,12,1,MRC,G0601205,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,1,2012-04-01

IL-1β secretion requires the protease caspase-1, which is activated following recruitment to inflammasomes. Endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from necrotic cells activate caspase-1 through an NLRP3-inflammasome. Here, we show that the endogenous lipid metabolite sphingosine (Sph) acts as a DAMP by inducing the NLRP3-inflammasome-dependent secretion of IL-1β from macrophages. This process was dependent upon serine/threonine protein phosphatases since the PP1/PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A inhibited Sph-induced IL-1β release. IL-1β release induced by other well-characterized NLRP3-inflammasome activators, such as ATP and uric acid crystals, in addition to NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasome activators was also blocked by these inhibitors.

The cytokines interleukin-1α (IL-1α) and IL-1β are key contributors to ischemic brain injury. However, there is very little evidence that IL-1 expression occurs at the protein level early enough (within hours) to influence brain damage after stroke. In order to determine this we investigated the temporal and spatial profiles of IL-1α and IL-1β expression after cerebral ischemia.Findings: We report here that in mice, as early as 4 h after reperfusion following ischemia induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, IL-1α, but not IL-1β, is expressed by microglia-like cells in the ischemic hemisphere, which parallels an upregulation of IL-1α mRNA. 24 h after ischemia IL-1α expression is closely associated with areas of focal blood brain barrier breakdown and neuronal death, mostly near the penumbra surrounding the infarct. The sub-cellular distribution of IL-1α in injured areas is not uniform suggesting that it is regulated.Conclusions: The early expression of IL-1α in areas of focal neuronal injury suggests that it is the major form of IL-1 contributing to inflammation early after cerebral ischemia. This adds to the growing body of evidence that IL-1α is a key mediator of the sterile inflammatory response. © 2011 Luheshi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,99,1,WT,201024,Wellcome Trust,papers by authors,2,2011-12-01

Cytokines are coordinators of inflammation and were originally defined as secreted mediators, released from expressing cells to activate plasma membrane receptors on responsive cells. However, a group of cytokines is now recognized as having dual functionality. In addition to their extracellular effects, these cytokines act inside the nuclei of cytokine-expressing or cytokine-responsive cells. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) family cytokines are key pro-inflammatory mediators, and blockade of the IL-1 system in inflammatory diseases is an attractive therapeutic goal. All current therapies target IL-1 extracellular actions. Here we review evidence that suggests IL-1 family members have dual functionality. Several IL-1 family members have been detected inside the nuclei of IL-1-expressing or IL-1-responsive cells, and intranuclear IL-1 is reported to regulate gene transcription and mRNA splicing. However, further work is required to determine the impact of IL-1 intranuclear actions on disease pathogenesis. The intranuclear actions of IL-1 family members represent a new and potentially important area of IL-1 biology and may have implications for the future development of anti-IL-1 therapies. © 2009 The British Pharmacological Society All rights reserved.",Disease | HMGB1 | IL-1RA | Inflammation | Interleukin-1 | Nuclear localization,61,0,MRC,G9219675,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2009-10-01

Zinc deficiency is a common consequence of, contributor to, human inflammatory disease. However, the molecular mechanisms through which zinc contributes to inflammatory disease remain largely unknown. We report here that zinc metabolism regulates caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. One of the endogenous mediators of IL-1β secretion is adenosine triphosphate, acting via the P2X7-receptor and caspase-1 activation in cells primed with an inflammatory stimulus such as LPS. We show that this process is selectively abolished by a brief pre-treatment with the zinc chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl) ethylene diamine (TPEN). These effects on IL-1β secretion were independent of rapid changes in free zinc within the cell, not a direct effect on caspase-1 activity, and upstream of caspase-1 activation. TPEN did however inhibit the activity of pannexin-1, a hemi-channel critical for adenosine triphosphate and nigericin-induced IL-1β release.

IL-1α and β are produced by cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages, and act largely after their secretion by binding to the type I IL-1 receptor on responsive cells. There is evidence that IL-1α is also a nuclear protein that can act intracellularly. In this study, we report that both IL-1α and IL-1β produced by microglia (central nervous system macrophages) in response to an inflammatory challenge are distributed between the cytosol and the nucleus. Using IL-1-β-galactosidase and IL-1-green fluorescent protein chimeras (analyzed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching), we demonstrate that nuclear import of IL-1α is exclusively active, requiring a nuclear localization sequence and Ran, while IL-1β nuclear import is entirely passive.

However, the mechanisms that control IL-1 release in acute neuronal injury are unknown and the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that neuronal injury induces IL-1β release from microglial cells. Here we report that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated rat microglia co-cultured with healthy rat neurons express pro-IL-1β, which in the absence of cell death accumulates in the cells. Treatment of co-cultures with the excitotoxin N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) induced neuronal cell death leading to the appearance of pro-IL-1β in the culture supernatant. This effect was reversed by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801, and was neuron-dependent, since NMDA had no effect on cell death or pro-IL-1β release in mixed glial cell cultures. In addition, we show that pro-IL-1β release from LPS-treated mixed glia or LPS-treated microglia is significantly reduced in the presence of conditioned medium from healthy co-cultures or neuronal cultures respectively. These results demonstrate that injured neurons promote the release of pro-IL-1β from microglia, possibly by regulating microglial cell viability, and suggest an important alternative mechanism of IL-1β release that occurs in response to neuronal injury. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The enzyme caspase-1 has been implicated in neuronal death. Deletion of the caspase-1 gene, or administration of partially selective inhibitors, reduces neuronal injury induced by cerebral ischemia in rodents. We report here, for the first time, that VRT-018858, the non-peptide, active metabolite of the selective caspase-1 inhibitor pro-drug, pralnacasan, markedly reduced ischemic injury in rats.

Despite its biological importance, the mechanisms of its processing to an active form and its trafficking to the extracellular compartment remain poorly understood. Interleukin-1β secretion is proposed to occur via several distinct mechanisms including microvesicle shedding and the regulated secretion of lysosomes. In this study, we report for the first time that caspase-1-dependent processing of pro-interleukin-1β can occur in the cytosol following activation of P2X7-receptor. We also provide evidence that the pathway of secretion in this model is independent of the lysosomal trafficking regulator, a protein involved in lysosome secretion. Although release of interleukin-1β occurred before the appearance of significant levels of lactate dehydrogenase in the supernatant, the cells ultimately died. It is clear that structural changes preceding cell death, occurring after caspase-1 activation, promote the cellular release of interleukin-1β. We investigated the involvement of lipid rafts in this process and discovered that depleting the plasma membrane of cholesterol did not adversely affect interleukin-1β secretion in response to ATP.

This rise in Ca 2+ was shown to cause a fall in cellular ATP levels, and the effect of carbachol on organelle movement could be mimicked by depleting ATP with metabolic inhibitors in the absence of any such rise in Ca2+. However, a Ca2+-sensing process independent of ATP appears also to be involved, because we identified conditions where the ATP depletion was blocked (by inhibitors of the Ca2+ pumps), but the organelle movements still ceased following a rise in cytosolic Ca2+. We conclude that the co-ordinated cessation of mitochondria and ER motility is a process regulated by the cytosolic concentration of both Ca2+ and ATP, and that these two parameters are likely to synergize to regulate the localization of the two organelles, and to facilitate the transfer of Ca2+ between them. © 2005 Biochemical Society.",ATP | Calcium signalling | Endoplasmic reticulum | Mitochondria | Organelle movement,76,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2005-12-01

However, such a concept assumes that, once translocated, a protein retains the free mobility it had in the cytoplasm, and also that the possible existence of partitioned pools of inositol lipids does not restrict its sphere of influence. We have explored by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) the mobility of four green-fluorescent-protein-tagged proteins, GAP1IP4BP and GAP1m, when they are either cytoplasmic or attached to the plasma membrane, and the PH domain of PI-PLCδ1 and ICAM as representative of, respectively, another inositol-lipid-anchored protein and a single-transmembrane-span-domain protein. The data from GAP1m and the PI-PLCδ1 PH domain show that, when proteins associate with inositol lipids in the plasma membrane, they retain a mobility similar to that in the cytoplasm, and probably also similar to the inositol lipid to which they are attached, suggesting a free diffusion within the plane of the membrane. Moreover, this free diffusion is similar whether they are bound to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or to PtdIns(4,5)P2, and no evidence was found by these criteria for restricted pools of PtdIns(4,5)P2. The mobility of GAP1IP4BP, which has been reported to associate with PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane, is much lower, suggesting that it might interact with other cellular components.

Activation of this receptor in bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages or monocytes also stimulates processing and release of the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) through activation of caspase-1. The cytokine interleukin 18 (IL-18) is also cleaved by caspase-1 and shares pro-inflammatory characteristics with IL-1β. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that IL-1β, IL-18, and/or caspase-1 activation contribute directly to macrophage cell death induced by LPS and ATP. Macrophages were cultured from normal mice or those in which genes for the P2X7 receptor, IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-18, or caspase-1 had been deleted. Our data confirm the importance of the P2X7 receptor in ATP-stimulated cell death and IL-1β release from LPS-primed macrophages. We demonstrate that prolonged stimulation with ATP leads to cell death, which is partly dependent on LPS priming and caspase-1, but independent of cytokine processing and release. We also provide evidence that LPS priming of macrophages makes them highly susceptible to the toxic effects of brief exposure to ATP, which leads to rapid cell death by a mechanism that is dependent on caspase-1 but, again, independent of cytokine processing and release.",,142,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2002-02-01

Inflammasome specks are released into the extracellular compartment from disrupting pyroptotic cells. The potential uptake and function of extracellular NLRP3 inflammasomes in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) are unknown. Fluorescently labeled NLRP3 inflammasome particles were isolated from a mutant NLRP3-YFP cell line and used to treat primary HCASMC for 4 and 24 h. Fluorescent and expressional analyses showed that extracellular NLRP3-YFP particles are internalized into HCASMC, where they remain active and stimulate intracellular caspase-1 (1.9-fold) and IL-1β (1.5-fold) activation without inducing pyroptotic cell death. Transcriptomic analysis revealed increased expression level of pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules (ICAM1, CADM1), NLRP3 and genes involved in cytoskleleton organization. The NLRP3-YFP particle-induced gene expression was not dependent on NLRP3 and caspase-1 activation. Instead, the effects were partly abrogated by blocking NFκB activation. Genes, upregulated by extracellular NLRP3 were validated in human carotid artery atheromatous plaques. Extracellular NLRP3-YFP inflammasome particles promoted the secretion of pro-atherogenic and inflammatory cytokines such as CCL2/MCP1, CXCL1 and IL-17E, and increased HCASMC migration (1.8-fold) and extracellular matrix production, such as fibronectin (5.8-fold) which was dependent on NFκB and NLRP3 activation. Extracellular NLRP3 inflammasome particles are internalized into human coronary artery smooth muscle cells where they induce pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects representing a novel mechanism of cell-cell communication and perpetuation of inflammation in atherosclerosis. Therefore, extracellular NLRP3 inflammasomes may be useful to improve the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases and the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies.",,0,1,MCIU,20859/PI/18,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,4,2021-12-01

We examined the role of NLRP3 in colonic neuromuscular dysfunctions in mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Experimental Approach: Wild-type C57BL/6J and NLRP3-KO (Nlrp3−/−) mice were fed with HFD or standard diet for 8 weeks. The activation of inflammasome pathways in colonic tissues from obese mice was assessed. The role of NLRP3 in in vivo colonic transit and in vitro tachykininergic contractions and substance P distribution was evaluated. The effect of substance P on NLRP3 signalling was tested in cultured cells. Key Results: HFD mice displayed increased body and epididymal fat weight, cholesterol levels, plasma resistin levels and plasma and colonic IL-1β levels, colonic inflammasome adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) and caspase-1 mRNA expression and ASC immunopositivity in macrophages. Colonic tachykininergic contractions were enhanced in HFD mice. HFD NLRP3−/− mice developed lower increase in body and epididymal fat weight, cholesterol levels, systemic and bowel inflammation. In HFD Nlrp3−/− mice, the functional alterations of tachykinergic pathways and faecal output were normalized. In THP-1 cells, substance P promoted IL-1β release. This effect was inhibited upon incubation with caspase-1 inhibitor or NK1 antagonist and not observed in ASC−/− cells. Conclusion and Implications: In obesity, NLRP3 regulates an interplay between the shaping of enteric immune/inflammatory responses and the activation of substance P/NK1 pathways underlying the onset of colonic dysmotility.

The decrease of intracellular K+ concentration is a minimal upstream signal to most of the NLRP3 activation models. Here, we found that cellular K+ efflux induces a stable structural change in the inactive NLRP3, promoting an open conformation as a step preceding activation. This conformational change is facilitated by the specific NLRP3 FISNA domain and a unique flexible linker sequence between the PYD and FISNA domains. This linker also facilitates the ensemble of NLRP3PYD into a seed structure for ASC oligomerization. The introduction of the NLRP3 PYD-linker-FISNA sequence into NLRP6 resulted in a chimeric receptor able to be activated by K+ efflux-specific NLRP3 activators and promoted an in vivo inflammatory response to uric acid crystals.

Pyroptosis is a lytic type of programmed cell death involved in inflammation, as well as a key fibrotic mechanism that is critical in the development of kidney pathology. Pyroptosis is induced by the cleavage of Gasdermins by various caspases and is executed by the insertion of the N-terminal fragment of cleaved Gasdermins into the plasma membrane, creating oligomeric pores and allowing the release of diverse proinflammatory products into the extracellular space. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes leading to the activation of caspase-1, which will cleave Gasdermin D, releasing several proinflammatory cytokines; this results in the initiation and amplification of the inflammatory response. Recent Advances: The efficacy of Gasdermin D cleavage is reduced by a change in the redox balance. Recently, several studies have shown that the attenuation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by antioxidant pathways results in a reduction of renal pyroptosis. In this review, we discuss the role of pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney disease; summarize the clinical outcomes and different molecular mechanisms leading to Gasdermin activation; and examine studies about the capacity of antioxidants, particularly Nrf2 activators, to ameliorate Gasdermin activity. Future Directions: We illustrate the potential influence of the deregulation of redox balance on inflammasome activity and pyroptosis as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of kidney diseases.

Although these membrane proteins are highly expressed in monocytes and macrophages, their role in the inflammatory process is still unclear. Here, we investigated the role of aquaglyceroporin AQP3 in NLRP3-inflammasome activation by complementary approaches based either on shRNA silencing or on AQP3 selective inhibition. The latter has been achieved using a reported potent gold-based inhibitor, Auphen. AQP3 inhibition or silencing partially blocked LPS-priming and decreased production of IL-6, proIL-1β, and TNF-α, suggesting the possible involvement of AQP3 in macrophage priming by Toll-like receptor 4 engagement. Moreover, AQP3-dependent cell reswelling increased IL-1β release through caspase-1 activation. NLRP3-inflammasome activation induced by reswelling, nigericin, and ATP was also blocked when AQP3 was inhibited or silenced.

However, the role of hepatocyte pyroptosis and extracellular inflammasome release in liver disease is unknown. Methods: We used primary mouse and human hepatocytes, hepatocyte-specific leucine 351 to proline Nlrp3KICreA mice, and GsdmdKO mice to investigate pyroptotic cell death in hepatocytes and its impact on liver inflammation and damage. Extracellular NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes were isolated from mutant NLRP3-YFP HEK cells and internalisation was studied in LX2 and primary human hepatic stellate cells. We also examined a cohort of 154 adult patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Western Australia). Results: We demonstrated that primary mouse and human hepatocytes can undergo pyroptosis upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation with subsequent release of NLRP3 inflammasome proteins that amplify and perpetuate inflammasome-driven fibrogenesis. Pyroptosis was inhibited by blocking caspase-1 and gasdermin D activation. The activated form of caspase-1 was detected in the livers and in serum from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and correlated with disease severity. Nlrp3KICreA mice showed spontaneous liver fibrosis under normal chow diet, and increased sensitivity to liver damage and inflammation after treatment with low dose lipopolysaccharide. Mechanistically, hepatic stellate cells engulfed extracellular NLRP3 inflammasome particles leading to increased IL-1β secretion and α-smooth muscle actin expression. This effect was abrogated when cells were pre-treated with the endocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin B. Conclusions: These results identify hepatocyte pyroptosis and release of inflammasome components as a novel mechanism to propagate liver injury and liver fibrosis development. Lay summary: Our findings identify a novel mechanism of inflammation in the liver. Experiments in cell cultures, mice, and human samples show that a specific form of cell death, called pyroptosis, leads to the release of complex inflammatory particles, the NLRP3 inflammasome, from inside hepatocytes into the extracellular space. From there they are taken up by other cells and thereby mediate inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic stress signals. The discovery of this mechanism may lead to novel treatments for chronic liver diseases in the future.",ASC | Fibrosis | Hepatocytes | Inflammasome | Liver | NASH | NLRP3 | Pyroptosis | Specks,23,0,NIH,FI12/00198,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2021-01-01

However, aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, including cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Here, we identify the receptor for activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1) as a component of the NLRP3 complexes in macrophages. RACK1 interacts with NLRP3 and NEK7 but not ASC. Suppression of RACK1 expression abrogates caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release in response to NLRP3- but not NLRC4- or AIM2-activating stimuli. This RACK1 function is independent of its ribosomal binding activity. Mechanistically, RACK1 promotes the active conformation of NLRP3 induced by activating stimuli and subsequent inflammasome assembly. These results demonstrate that RACK1 is a critical mediator for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.",Caspase-1 | IL-1β | NEK7 | NLRP3 inflammasome | RACK1,6,1,NIH,R01AI06331,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2020-11-01

In the past few years, the identification of novel AIDs expanded their phenotypes toward more complex clinical pictures associating vasculopathy, autoimmunity, or immunodeficiency. Herein, we describe two unrelated patients suffering since the neonatal period from a complex disease mainly characterized by severe sterile inflammation, recurrent bacterial infections, and marked humoral immunodeficiency. Whole-exome sequencing detected a novel, de novo heterozygous PLCG2 variant in each patient (p.Ala708Pro and p.Leu845_Leu848del). A clear enhanced PLCγ2 activity for both variants was demonstrated by both ex vivo calcium responses of the patient’s B cells to IgM stimulation and in vitro assessment of PLC activity. These data supported the autoinflammation and PLCγ2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (APLAID) diagnosis in both patients. Immunological evaluation revealed a severe decrease of immunoglobulins and B cells, especially class-switched memory B cells, with normal T and NK cell counts. Analysis of bone marrow of one patient revealed a reduced immature B cell fraction compared with controls. Additional investigations showed that both PLCG2 variants activate the NLRP3-inflammasome through the alternative pathway instead of the canonical pathway. Collectively, the evidences here shown expand APLAID diversity toward more severe phenotypes than previously reported including dominantly inherited agammaglobulinemia, add novel data about its genetic basis, and implicate the alternative NLRP3-inflammasome activation pathway in the basis of sterile inflammation.",agammaglobulinemia | APLAID | Autoinflammatory diseases | caspase-1 | inflammasome | interleukin-1 | PLCγ2,9,1,MCIU,PI14/00405,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,3,2020-10-01

In a dextran sodium sulfate and azoxymethane (DSS/AOM) mouse model, deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of extracellular GzmA both attenuate gut inflammation and prevent CRC development, including the initial steps of cell transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.

Accordingly, colon tissues from DSS/AOM-treated, GzmA-deficient animals present reduced levels of pSTAT3.

We aimed to identify disease activity biomarkers in multiple sclerosis by performing an RNA sequencing approach in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a discovery cohort of 44 untreated patients with multiple sclerosis belonging to different clinical forms and activity phases of the disease, and 12 healthy control subjects. A validation cohort of 58 patients with multiple sclerosis and 26 healthy control subjects was included in the study to replicate the RNA sequencing findings. The RNA sequencing revealed an interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) signature in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Subsequent immunophenotyping pointed to blood monocytes as responsible for the IL1B signature observed in this group of patients. Functional experiments at baseline measuring apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation showed that the NOD-leucine rich repeat and pyrin containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome was overactive in monocytes from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation with a combination of ATP plus lipopolysaccharide was associated with increased IL1B production in this group of patients. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis patients with high IL1B gene expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells progressed significantly faster compared to patients with low IL1B levels based on the time to reach an EDSS of 6.0 and the Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score. In agreement with peripheral blood findings, both NLRP3 and IL1B expression in brain tissue from patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis was mainly restricted to cells of myeloid lineage. Treatment of mice with a specific NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor attenuated established experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis disease severity and improved CNS histopathology. NLRP3 inflammasome-specific inhibition was also effective in reducing axonal damage in a model of lipopolysaccharide-neuroinflammation using organotypic cerebellar cultures. Altogether, these results point to a role of IL1B and the NLRP3 inflammasome as prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target, respectively, in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.",Biomarkers | Multiple sclerosis | NLRP3 inflammasome | Prognostic factor | Therapeutic target,26,1,EC,MTM2015-64465-C2-1-R,European Commission,papers by authors,1,2020-05-01

Our method confirms that macrophages are the main peritoneal leukocyte subpopulation isolated from the human peritoneum in homeostasis. We showed that primary human peritoneal macrophages present phagocytic and oxidative activities, and respond to activation of the main proinflammatory pathways such as Toll-like receptors and inflammasomes, resulting in the secretion of different proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, this method provides a useful tool for characterizing primary human macrophages as control cells for studies of molecular inflammatory pathways in steady-state conditions and for comparing them with those obtained from pathologies involving the peritoneal cavity.

Here we describe WD repeat containing protein 90 (WDR90) as a new inflammasome component. We found that zebrafish wdr90 is highly induced by guanylate binding protein 4 (Gbp4) independently of inflammasome activation and caspase-1 activity. This gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein with unknown functions that contains several WD40 domains, which are involved in coordinating multiprotein complex assembly. Functional studies in zebrafish larvae showed that forced expression of wdr90 increased caspase-1 activity and inflammasome-dependent resistance to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection. Wdr90 acted upstream of zebrafish caspase a (Caspa), the functional homolog of mammalian caspase-1, and Asc. Reconstitution experiments of the human inflammasome in HEK293 cells demonstrated that WDR90 was able to physically interact with and to alter the cellular distribution of NLRC4, but not of NLRP3 and AIM2.

Extracellular nucleotides activate two types of receptors, the ionotropic purinergic P2X and the metabotropic purinergic P2Y receptors, inducing the release of cytokines and promoting cell recruitment. Several P2X receptors are associated with an increase in the production of immunoactive lipids mediators, which in turn are able to interfere with the activation of different P2Y receptors, establishing a tight signalling link between purinergic receptors and lipid mediators. In this review, we summarise recent studies indicating signalling crosstalk between purinergic P2X and P2Y receptor activation and lipid mediators with a focus on inflammatory diseases.

The trend in biomaterials research has shifted from biocompatible “immune-evasive” biomaterials to “immune-interactive” materials that modulate the inflammatory response supporting implant integration as well as improving healing and tissue regeneration. Inflammasomes are large intracellular multiprotein complexes that are key players in host defence during innate immune responses and assemble after recognition of pathogens or danger signals. The process of biomaterial implantation causes injury to tissues that will consequently release danger signals that could be sensed by the inflammasome. There are increasing evidences that the inflammasome has a role in several inflammatory processes, from pathogen clearance to chronic inflammation or tissue repair. Thus, modulation of the inflammasome activity appears as an important target in the development of effective approaches in regenerative medicine. In this review, we discuss the main points of the current understanding on the host response to implanted biomaterials and how the paradigm of “immune-evasive” biomaterials has shifted over the last years; the significance of the inflammasome in the inflammatory response to biomaterials; and the growing idea that the immune system is of key importance in an effective tissue repair and regeneration.

These processes can initiate and perpetuate an abnormal wound-healing response with the principle cellular target being the activation of hepatic stellate cells. From the various inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory liver diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a disease process that is soaring and has evolved as a primary cause of liver fibrosis and need for liver transplantation.

Among them we could highlight the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that induce and maintain the inflammatory response. Usually, inflammasomes result from oligomerization of a nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor (NLR) after sensing different pathogenic or endogenous sterile dangerous signals; however, other proteins such as absent in melanoma 2, retinoic acid-inducible gene I, or pyrin could also form inflammasome platforms. Inflammasome oligomerization leads to caspase-1 activation and the processing and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1ß and IL-18. Mutations in different inflammasomes are causative for multiple periodic hereditary syndromes or autoinflammatory diseases, characterized by acute systemic inflammatory flares not associated with infections, tumors, or autoimmunity. This review focuses on germline mutations that have been described in cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) for NLRP3 or in familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and pyrin-associated autoinflammation with neutrophilic dermatosis (PAAND) for MEFV.

Lipin-2 regulates MAPK activation, which mediates synthesis of pro-IL-1β during inflammasome priming. Lipin-2 also inhibits the activation and sensitization of the purinergic receptor P2X7 and K+ efflux, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein with a CARD domain oligomerization, and caspase-1 processing, key events during inflammasome activation. Reduced levels of lipin-2 in macrophages lead to a decrease in cellular cholesterol levels. In fact, restoration of cholesterol concentrations in cells lacking lipin-2 decreases ion currents through the P2X7 receptor, and downstream events that drive IL-1β production.

Here we have identified the purinergic signaling through the P2X7 receptor as an important component for the neuronal death in a model of optic nerve axotomy. We have found that in P2X7 receptor deficient mice there is a delayed loss of retinal ganglion cells and a decrease of phagocytic microglia at early times points after axotomy. In contralateral to the axotomy retinas, P2X7 receptor controlled the numbers of phagocytic microglia, suggesting that extracellular ATP could act as a danger signal activating the P2X7 receptor in mediating the loss of neurons in contralateral retinas. Finally, we show that intravitreal administration of the selective P2X7 receptor antagonist A438079 also delays axotomy-induced retinal ganglion cell death in retinas from wild type mice. Thus, our work demonstrates that P2X7 receptor signaling is involved in neuronal cell death after axonal injury, being P2X7 receptor antagonism a potential therapeutic strategy.",,17,1,FP7,614578,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,1,2016-12-01

This hyperactivated migration is independent of Na V and is prevented by overexpression of the intracellular C-terminus of β4. Conversely, SCN4B overexpression reduces cancer cell invasiveness and tumour progression, indicating that SCN4B/β4 represents a metastasis-suppressor gene.",,32,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2016-12-01

We previously showed that the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R or P2RX7) is overexpressed in circulating lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. In the present study we investigated the P2X7R/NLRP3 inflammasome axis in lymphocytes from a cohort of 23 CLL patients. P2X7R, ASC and NLRP3 were investigated by Western blot, PCR and transfection techniques. P2X7R was overexpressed and correlated with chromosome 12 trisomy in CLL patients. ASC mRNA and protein were also overexpressed. On the contrary, NLRP3 was dramatically down-modulated in CLL lymphocytes relative to lymphocytes from healthy donors. To further investigate the correlation between P2X7R, NLRP3 and cell growth, NLRP3 was silenced in THP-1 cells, a leukemic cell line that natively expresses both NLRP3 and P2X7R. NLRP3 silencing enhanced P2X7R expression and promoted growth. On the contrary, NLRP3 overexpression caused accelerated apoptosis. The P2X7R was also up-modulated in hematopoietic cells from NLRP3-KO mice. In conclusion, we show that NLRP3 downmodulation stimulates P2X7R expression and promotes growth, while NLRP3 overexpression inhibits cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis. These findings suggest that NLRP3 is a negative regulator of growth and point to a role of the P2X7R/NLRP3 axis in CLL.",,30,1,FP7,PI13/00174,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,1,2016-05-01

Moreover, mutations in two RNA binding proteins, TAR DNA binding protein 43 and fused in sarcoma, have raised the intriguing possibility that perturbations of RNA metabolism, including that of the small endogenous RNA molecules that repress target genes at the posttranscriptional level, that is, microRNAs, may contribute to disease pathogenesis. At present, the mechanisms by which microglia actively participate to both toxic and neuroprotective actions in ALS constitute an important matter of research. Among the pathways involved in ALS-altered microglia responses, in previous works we have uncovered the hyperactivation of P2X7 receptor by extracellular ATP and the overexpression of miR-125b, both leading to uncontrolled toxic M1 reactions. In order to shed further light on the complexity of these processes, in this short review we will describe the M1/M2 functional imprinting of primary microglia and a role played by P2X7 and miR-125b in ALS microglia activation.",,28,1,FP7,614578,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,4,2016-01-01

In contrast, long-term stimulation of P2X7 is generally associated with membrane permeabilisation and cell death. Recently, P2X7 has attracted great attention in the cancer field, and particularly in the neoplastic transformation and the progression of solid tumours. A growing number of studies were published; however they often appeared contradictory in their results and conclusions. As such, the involvement of P2X7 in the oncogenic process remains unclear so far. The present review aims to discuss the current knowledge and hypotheses on the involvement of the P2X7 receptor in the development and progression of solid tumours, and highlight the different aspects that require further clarification in order to decipher whether P2X7 could be considered as a cancer biomarker or as a target for pharmacological intervention.

Little is known about the signals that modulate H2O2 release from DUOX1 and whether the H 2O2 gradient can orchestrate the inflammatory response in vivo. In this study, we report on a dominant-negative form of zebrafish Duox1 that is able to inhibit endogenous Duox1 activity, H2O2 release and leukocyte recruitment after tissue injury, with none of the side effects associated with morpholino-mediated Duox1 knockdown. Using this specific tool, we found that ATP release following tissue injury activates purinergic P2Y receptors, and modulates Duox1 activity through phospholipase C (PLC) and intracellular calcium signaling in vivo. Furthermore, Duox1-derived H 2O2 is able to trigger the NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway. These data reveal that extracellular ATP acting as an early danger signal is responsible for the activation of Duox1 via a P2YR/PLC/Ca 2+ signaling pathway and the production of H2O 2, which, in turn, is able to modulate in vivo not only the early recruitment of leukocytes to the wound but also the inflammatory response through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

Serum complement or bacterial pore-forming toxins can perforate the plasma membrane provoking uncontrolled Ca2+ influx, loss of cytoplasmic constituents and cell lysis. Plasmalemmal blebbing has previously been shown to protect cells against bacterial pore-forming toxins. The activation of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), an ATP-gated trimeric membrane cation channel, triggers Ca2+ influx and induces blebbing. We have investigated the role of the P2X7R as a regulator of plasmalemmal protection after toxin-induced membrane perforation caused by bacterial streptolysin O (SLO).Our results show that the expression and activation of the P2X7R furnishes cells with an increased chance of surviving attacks by SLO. This protective effect can be demonstrated not only in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells transfected with the P2X7R, but also in human mast cells (HMC-1), which express the receptor endogenously. In addition, this effect is abolished by treatment with blebbistatin or A-438079, a selective P2X7R antagonist. Thus blebbing, which is elicited by the ATP-mediated, paracrine activation of the P2X7R, is part of a cellular non-immune defense mechanism. It pre-empts plasmalemmal damage and promotes cellular survival. This mechanism is of considerable importance for cells of the immune system which carry the P2X7R and which are specifically exposed to toxin attacks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Annexin | Blebbing | Calcium | Lysis | P2X7 | Plasmalemma,18,1,SNF,3100A0_121980/1,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,papers by authors,1,2014-05-01

In this review, we summarize current knowledge of endometriosis pathophysiology, in particular, the balance between local 2-methoxyestradiol production and angiogenesis, which could promote the development of endometriotic lesions. 2-Methoxyestradiol emerges as a promising new candidate for the treatment of endometriosis. © The Author(s) 2012.",2-methoxyoestradiol | angiogenesis | apoptosis | endometriosis | estrogen,16,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2012-10-01

Recent studies using inflammasome knockout mice have shown that different inflammasomes control immunity in different pathologies. Drug-like antagonists acting up-or down-stream of the inflammasome pathway have been successfully used in clinics as important therapeutics to treat different inflammatory diseases. Areas covered: The current literature has been reviewed on the role of inflammasomes in inflammatory disease, focusing on potential therapeutic applications of selective inflammasome antagonists as anti-inflammatory agents. Particular emphasis has been placed on the potential role of the different inflammasomes in common inflammatory diseases. The latest clinical developments for drugs targeting inflammasome pathways are covered. Expert opinion: Recent studies using inflammasome knockout mice suggest its importance as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory disease. However, efficacious antagonists for the inflammasome for use in clinical studies are still at an early stage of development. Developing selective inflammasome antagonists is a challenge that if met, offers promise for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. Major developments in this area will include the identification of reliable high-throughput screening methods for compounds directly targeting inflammasome assembly. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.",Caspase-1 | Inflammasome | Inflammation | Interleukin-1 | P2X7 receptor,60,0,ISCIII,undefined,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,5,2012-07-01

Trichinella spiralis-infected mice develop a postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity that is reminiscent of the clinical features associated with postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome. In this study, we used P2X7R knockout mice (P2X7R-/-) to investigate the role of P2X7R activation in the in vivo production of IL-1β and the development of postinflammatory visceral hypersensitivity in the T. spiralis-infected mouse. During acute nematode infection, IL-1β-containing cells and P2X7R expression were increased in the jejunum of wild-type (WT) mice. Peritoneal and serum IL-1β levels were also increased, which was indicative of elevated IL-1β release. However, in the P2X7R-/- animals, we found that infection had no effect upon intracellular, plasma, or peritoneal IL-1β levels. Conversely, infection augmented peritoneal TNF-α levels in both WT and P2X7R-/- animals. Infection was also associated with a P2X7R-dependent increase in extracellular peritoneal lactate dehydrogenase, and it triggered immunological changes in both strains. Jejunal afferent fiber mechanosensitivity was assessed in uninfected and postinfected WT and P2X7R-/- animals. Postinfected WT animals developed an augmented afferent fiber response to mechanical stimuli; however, this did not develop in postinfected P2X7R-/- animals. Therefore, our results demonstrated that P2X7Rs play a pivotal role in intestinal inflammation and are a trigger for the development of visceral hypersensitivity.

They have been extensively studied in immune cells where their activation leads to the rapid release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the initiation of the inflammatory cascade. As such, P2X7 represent a pharmaceutical target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. Recently, P2X7 expression has been found in diverse tumours and has been suggested as a potential cancer cell biomarker. On ATP stimulation, tumour cells can use P2X7 signalling in different scenarios: i) as a reaction to this death-related signal, they can downregulate P2X7 to avoid apoptosis or ii) as a cancer-promoting signal to survive and enhance invasion of new niches. The high levels of extracellular ATP found in tumours could represent a stressful stimulus for cancer cells by initiating P2X7-driven cell death. Therefore, the increased P2X7-dependent invasiveness of cancer cells could be an escape strategy to flee the noxious high level of ATP. The use of specific P2X7 antagonists could be a new alternative way to reduce the development of cancer metastases and improve the efficacy of conventional treatments. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.",cancer | cell growth | extracellular ATP | invasion | metastases | P2X7 receptor | tumour,53,0,ISCIII,EC10/020,Fundación Séneca,papers by authors,3,2011-07-01

In this issue of the BJP, Marques-da-Silva et al. demonstrate that colchicine is a potent inhibitor of both P2X7 and P2X2 receptor-dependent dye uptake, without affecting the ion channels. Colchicine also blocked the pro-inflammatory signalling downstream of P2X7 receptor activation, both in vitro and in vivo.

Anti-inflammatory actions of P2X7R antagonists are considered to result from inhibition of P2X7R-induced release of proinflammatory cytokines from activated macrophages. However, P2X7Rs are also expressed in resting macrophages, suggesting that P2X7R may also signal via cytokine-independent mechanisms involved in joint disease. In this study, we examined P2X7R function in resting human lung macrophages and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and found that ATP induced rapid release of the lysosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B, K, L, and S and that was independent of the presence of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Cathepsins released into the medium were effective to degrade collagen extracellular matrix. ATP-induced cathepsin release was abolished by P2X 7R antagonists, absent from P2X7R-/- mouse macrophages, and not associated with cell death. Our results suggest P2X 7R activation may play a novel and direct role in tissue damage through release of cathepsins independently of its proinflammatory actions via IL-1 cytokines.

In contrast, M2 polarized macrophages are critical to the resolution of inflammation but neither actions of P2X 7 R on these macrophages nor mechanisms by which macrophages switch from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotypes are known. Here, we investigated extracellular ATP signalling over a dynamic macrophage polarity gradient from M1 through M2 phenotypes. In macrophages polarized towards, but not at, M2 phenotype, in which intracellular IL-1Β remains high and the inflammasome is intact, P2X 7 R activation selectively uncouples to the NLRP3-inflammasome activation but not to upstream ion channel activation.

How this dye uptake path forms and whether it is involved in IL-1β release has not been known. Pannexin-1 is a recently identified protein found to physically associate with the P2X7R. Inhibition of pannexin-1 does not alter P2X7 R ion channel activation or associated calcium flux but blocks one component of P2X7R-induced dye uptake and unmasks a slower, previously undetected, dye uptake pathway. Inhibition of pannexin-1 blocks P2X7R-mediated IL-1η release from macrophage as well as release mediated by other stimuli which couple to activation of capase-1 and additionally inhibits the release of interleukin-1α, a member of the IL-1 family whose processing does not require caspase-1 activation.

Panx1 does not form gap junctions in mammalian cells, but it may function as a plasma membrane hemichannel. Little is known of the pharmacological properties of panx1 expression in mammalian cells. Here, we identify three variants in the human PANX1 gene. We expressed these variants and mouse Panx1 in mammalian cells and compared Panx1-induced currents. All human Panx1 variants and the mouse Panx1 showed identical protein expression levels, localization patterns, and functional properties, although the frequency of functional expression was species-dependent. Panx1 currents were independent of changes in extracellular or intracellular calcium or phospholipase C transduction. We found compounds that inhibited Panx1 currents with a rank order of potency: carbenoxolone > disodium 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS) ≈ disodium 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanato-stilben-2,2′-disulfonate ≈ 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid > indanyloxyacetic acid 94 ≫ probenecid ≫ flufenamic acid = niflumic acid. Triphosphate nucleotides (ATP, GTP, and UTP) rapidly and reversibly inhibited Panx1 currents via mechanism(s) independent of purine receptors. When Panx1 was coexpressed with purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), DIDS was found to act as a P2X 7R antagonist to inhibit ATP-evoked currents, but none of the other compounds inhibited P2X7R currents. This is the first detailed pharmacological characterization of Panx1-mediated currents in mammalian cells and sheds new, although contradictory, light on the hypothesis that Panx1 acts as a hemichannel to allow passage of large molecules in response to P2X 7R activation.

Agonist-induced membrane currents at hyperpolarized potentials show pronounced facilitation during the initial 30-100 s of receptor activation but mechanisms responsible have not been elucidated. We measured facilitation of ATP-gated currents in HEK cells expressing rat P2X7R and delineated distinct calcium-dependent and independent processes. The calcium-dependent facilitation was composed of an instantaneous (millisecond time domain) and slowly developing (time constant, 20 s with maximum agonist stimulation) component. Both components were preventedwhenrecording with a highly specific calmodulin (CaM) inhibitory peptide but only the instantaneous component was reduced by expression of the dominant-negative EF-handless CaM mutant. Coimmunoprecipitation assays detected low levels of CaM binding to unstimulated P2X7R, and this increased by 50% during 45 s stimulation of the receptor. We identified a novel 1-5-16 Ca2+-dependent CaM binding motif in the intracellular C terminus of P2X7R; mutations in this domain resulted in the absence of calcium-dependent facilitation and binding of CaM to unstimulated or stimulated receptor. Blockade of CaM binding also delayed membrane blebbing by threefold. Our results demonstrate that CaM binds constitutively to closed P2X7R channels and dynamically during channel activation to significantly enhance and prolong calcium entry. This is the first example of CaM deregulating, rather than tightly controlling, calcium entry through an ion channel.

The discovery of new proteins regulating IL-1 processing and release opens an exciting field for the design of novel antiinflammatory drugs. Among those are the purinergic ATP-gated P2X(7) receptor (P2X(7)R) and its downstream signaling molecule Pannexin-1 (Panx-1), both involved in the control of the activation and the release of mature IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-18.

Mechanisms underlying their cellular release remain unclear. Activation of purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) by extracellular ATP is a key physiological inducer of rapid IL-1β release from LPS-primed macrophage. We investigated patterns of ATP-mediated release of IL-1 cytokines from three macrophage types in attempts to provide direct evidence for or against distinct release mechanisms. We used peritoneal macrophage from P2X7R -/- mice and found that release of IL-1α, IL-18, as well as IL-1β, by ATP resulted exclusively from activation of P2X7R, release of all these IL-1 cytokines involved pannexin-1 (panx1), and that there was both a panx1-dependent and -independent component to IL-lβ release. We compared IL-1-release patterns from LPS-primed peritoneal macrophage, RAW264.7 macrophage, and J774A.1 macrophage. We found RAW264.7 macrophage readily release pro-IL-1β independently of panx1 but do not release mature IL-1β because they do not express apoptotic speck-like protein with a caspase-activating recruiting domain and so have no caspase-1 inflammasome activity. We delineated two distinct release pathways: the well-known caspase-1 cascade mediating release of processed IL-1β that was selectively blocked by inhibition of caspase-1 or panxl, and a calcium-independent, caspase-1/panx1-independent release of pro-IL-1β that was selectively blocked by glycine. None of these release responses were associated with cell damage or cytolytic effects. This provides the first direct demonstration of a distinct signaling mechanism responsible for ATP-induced release of pro-IL-1β.

The secretory response to bile acids, fluid transport and bile absorption was examined in intestinal tissues from a Trichinella spiralis mouse model of postinfectious gut dysfunction in vitro. Changes in the protein expression of apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) were also measured. Design: T. spiralis-infected mice were killed at 18 and 25 days postinfection. Jejunal, ileal, proximal and distal colon segments were exposed to taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) or cholic acid. Short circuit current (SCC) increases were determined. Tritiated taurocholic acid (3H-TCA) absorption was determined in everted jejunal and ileal sacs. ASBT protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Results: Basal SCC increased in ileum and distal colon at 18 and 25 days postinfection, respectively. Ileal SCC responses to TDCA and cholic acid were enhanced at 18 days postinfection. Distal colon SCC response to TDCA was raised at 18 days postinfection but was significantly reduced by 25 days. Ileal 3H-TCA uptake was significantly reduced at 18 and 25 days postinfection. Surprisingly, increased ASBT expression was observed in infected animals. Conclusions: In a T. spiralis model of postinfectious gut dysfunction, decreased bile absorption and enhanced secretion in response to bile acids was observed.

In humans, the caspase family includes 13 members whose functions seem to correlate with their phylogenetic relationship. They are classified into two main groups, the cell death (apoptotic) and the inflammatory caspases. Caspase-1 is the best characterized inflammatory caspase and is responsible for the processing of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-18 and IL-33. Despite the importance of caspase-1 in inflammation, no information is available on the presence and activity of this enzyme in fish. In this study, we cloned a caspase-1-like gene from the bony fish gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) which shows a conserved N-terminal caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) and a C-terminal caspase catalytic domain. The seabream caspase-1 gene was expressed in 1 day post-hatching larvae and its mRNA levels increased throughout development. In adult fish, caspase-1 was found to be constitutively expressed in all immune tissues analyzed and, unexpectedly, infection of fish and stimulation of professional phagocytes in vitro decreased its mRNA levels. It was also demonstrated that the recombinant seabream caspase-1 ectopically expressed in HEK293 cells was able to cleave a caspase-1 specific substrate, this activity being enhanced upon activation of the rat P2X7 receptor with BzATP. Finally, seabream fibroblast cell line SAF-1 and primary leukocytes showed endogenous caspase-1 activity, which was almost completely inhibited by a caspase-1 specific inhibitor. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Blockade of pannexin-1 in macrophage endogenously expressing the ATP-gated P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) blocks the initial dye uptake, but not the ionic current, and also blocks processing and release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in response to P2X7R activation. These results suggest that pannexin-1 may be a hemichannel activated by the P2X7R to provide the conduit for dye uptake and downstream signaling to processing and release of IL-1β. We have pursued this hypothesis by measuring dye uptake and IL-1β processing and release in mouse J774 macrophage in response to P2X7R activation and to maitotoxin and nigericin, two agents considered to evoke IL-1β release via the same mechanism. The experiments were carried out over time periods during which no lactate dehydrogenase was released from cells to examine only noncytolytic pathways. P2X7R activation evoked dye uptake that could be separated into two components by pannexin-1 inhibition: an initial rapid phase and a slower pannexin-1-independent phase. Maitotoxin-evoked dye uptake was unaltered by pannexin-1 inhibition. Nigericin did not induce dye uptake. Inhibition of pannexin-1 blocked caspase-1 and IL-1β processing and release in response to all three stimuli. Thus, although pannexin-1 is required for IL-1β release in response to maitotoxin, nigericin, and ATP, a mechanism distinct from pannexin-1 hemichannel activation must underlie the former two processes. © 2007 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,247,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2007-01-01

However, there are striking species differences in these properties. We sought to exploit the large differences in ATP and BzATP responses between rat and mouse P2X7R to delineate regions or specific residues that may be responsible for the unique actions of these agonists at the P2X7R. We measured membrane currents in response to ATP and BzATP at wild-type rat and mouse P2X7R, at chimeric P2X7Rs, and at mouse P2X7Rs bearing point mutations. Wild-type rat P2X7R was 10 times more sensitive to ATP and 100 times more sensitive to BzATP than wild-type mouse P2X7R. We found that agonist EC50 values were determined solely by the ectodomain of the P2X7R. Two segments (residues 115-136 and 282-288), when transposed together, converted mouse sensitivities to those of rat. Point mutations through these regions revealed a single residue, asparagine 284, in the rat P2X7R that fully accounted for the 10-fold difference in ATP sensitivity, whereas the 100-fold difference in BzATP sensitivity required the transfer of both Lys127 and Asn 284 from rat to mouse. Thus, single amino acid differences between species can account for large changes in agonist effectiveness and differentiate between the two widely used agonists at P2X7 receptors.

We noted differences in mouse cDNA sequences that may indicate polymorphisms; the aim of this study was to compare function and expression of these mouse P2X 7 receptor mutations. Experimental approach: There are three differences in the sequences of P2X 7 cDNA cloned from mouse NTW8 microglial cells or C57 BL/6 mice: [Phe 11,Ala 221,Met 283]P2X 7 in the former and [Leu 11,Thr 221,Thr 283]P2X 7 in the latter. We expressed these receptors and measured membrane currents, ethidium uptake, calcium influx and surface membrane expression. We also carried out these assays on the previously described polymorphism observed between C57 BL/6 and Balb/c mice ([Leu 451]P2X 7 vs [Pro 451]P2X 7). Key results: Maximum current densities at [Phe 11,Ala 221, Met 283]P2X 7 were <12% of those at [Leu 11,Thr 221,Thr 283]P2X 7 without change in the agonist concentration-response. Replacing methionine with threonine at residue 283 yielded a receptor whose properties were the same as [Leu 11,Thr 221,Thr 283]P2X 7. Replacing T283 in the rat P2X 7 receptor with methionine yielded currents that were <10% of wildtype and no ethidium uptake was associated with its activation. Maximum current densities and agonist EC 50 values were the same at mouse [Thr 283,Leu 451]P2X 7 and [Thr 283,Pro 451]P2X 7 but ethidium uptake and Fluo4 fluorescence were significantly reduced at the [Thr 283,Leu 451]P2X 7 receptor. There was equivalent surface membrane expression of all P2X 7 receptors. Conclusions: This study has revealed a residue (Thr 283) in the ectodomain that is critical for P2X 7 receptor function and suggests that the intracellular residue 451 alters downstream signalling independently of ion channel activity. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",Biotinylation | Dye uptake | Ion channel | Mutagenesis | Patch clamp | Purine receptor,37,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2006-10-01

This suggests that differences exist in antigen presentation and naïve lymphocyte stimulation, a prerequisite for the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Intraperitoneal injection of the bony fish gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) with intact Vibrio anguillarum, as a particulate bacterial antigen, results in the mobilisation of head-kidney leucocytes to the peritoneal cavity and priming of their respiratory burst activity. We have also observed the rapid infiltration of acidophilic granulocytes, which are leucocytes functionally equivalent to mammalian neutrophils, into the spleen. These cells may be involved in antigen capture and transport to the spleen, since an apparent association between mobilised acidophilic granulocytes, bacterial antigens and proliferating lymphocytes has been seen in this organ. Collectively, these results suggest that, in addition to being actively involved in bacterial clearance, fish phagocytic granulocytes play a role in the initiation and support of the adaptive immune response. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Acidophilic granulocytes | Antigen transport | Bacterial infection | Fish | Sparus aurata L.

RT-PCR shows that the seabream TNFα messenger was widely and constitutively accumulated. Lastly, stimuli known to upregulate seabream IL-1β, lipopolysaccharide and lymphocyte-derived macrophage-activating factor, failed to upregulate TNFα in cultured macrophages. The putative role of three AU-rich endotoxin-responsive motifs (AREs) of seabream TNFα mRNA, found within two phylogenetically conserved protein binding regions, is discussed.",AU-rich elements | Fish | Macrophages | Phylogeny | Tumor necrosis factor alpha,121,0,MICYT,PB98–0387,Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología,papers by authors,1,2002-07-01

Selectins, integrins and immunoglobulin gene superfamily adhesion receptors mediate the different steps of leukocyte migration from the blood-stream towards inflammatory foci. In addition to their adhesive function, these receptors modulate major cellular processes such as cell activation, growth, differentiation and death. To characterise the fish molecules involved in cell adhesion, a panel of mAbs was raised by immunising mice with macrophages from the marine fish gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.). One of these mAbs, which we named anti-Aggregatin, was found to induce a rapid heterotypic aggregation of seabream leukocytes. Anti-Aggregatin defined a 140-kDa cell surface receptor which was highly expressed by macrophages and was up-regulated after co-stimulation with LPS and MAF. Functionally, the cell adhesion which occurred upon exposure to anti-Aggregatin required Ca2+, an intact cytoskeleton and an active cell metabolism. More importantly, Aggregatin engagement resulted in strong inhibition of the phagocyte respiratory burst, although the cells showed neither loss of viability nor DNA fragmentation.

Early events in the pathobiology of the disease include oxidative, metabolic, or mechanical stress that acts upon RGC, causing these to rapidly release danger signals, including extracellular ATP, resulting in micro‐ and macroglial activation and neuroinflammation. Danger signaling also leads to the formation of inflammasomes in the retina that enable maturation of proinflammatory cytokines such IL‐1β and IL‐18. Chronic neuroinflammation can have directly damaging effects on RGC, but it also creates a proinflammatory environment and compromises the immune privilege of the retina. In particular, continuous synthesis of proinflammatory mediators such as TNFα, IL‐1β, and anaphylatoxins weakens the blood–retina barrier and recruits or activates T‐cells. Recent data have demonstrated that adaptive immune responses strongly exacerbate RGC loss in animal models of the disease as T‐cells appear to target heat shock proteins displayed on the surface of stressed RGC to cause their apoptotic death. It is possible that dysregulation of these immune responses contributes to the continued loss of RGC in some patients.",Adaptive immune response | Dysfunction | Glaucoma | Inflammasome | Innate immune response,0,1,NIH,EY032261,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,2,2021-08-01

Cucurbitacin B (CuB), extracted from muskmelon pedicel, is a natural bioactive product that could effectively exert anti-tumor activities in lung cancer. However, the exact molecular mechanisms and the direct targets of CuB in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain to be discovered. Here, we firstly found that CuB exerted an anti-tumor effect via pyroptosis in NSCLC cells and NSCLC mice models. Next, based on the molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), we identified that CuB directly bound to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which further caused the separation of N- and C-terminals of Gasdermin D (GSDMD) to execute pyroptosis. Moreover, CuB enhanced the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20 accumulation, and cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) release, leading to pyroptosis in NSCLC cells. Silencing of TLR4 inhibited CuB-induced pyroptosis and decreased the level of ROS and Ca2+ in A549 cells. In vivo study showed that CuB treatment suppressed lung tumor growth in mice via pyroptosis without dose-dependent manner, and CuB at 0.75 mg/kg had a better anti-tumor effect compared to the Gefitinib group.

The P2X7 receptor is an essential ligand-gated channel that contributes to many physiological processes, especially inflammation. However, genetic variations can alter the P2X7 receptor function. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the impact of P2X7 genetic polymorphisms and expression on susceptibility to RA in a sample of the Iranian population. Methods: We enrolled 160 (145 female, 15 male) RA patients and 160 (142 female, 18 male) healthy individuals in this study. Genotyping was performed using tetra amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (TARMS-PCR) for rs1718119, rs2230912, rs2393799, rs28360457, rs35933842, and allele-specific PCR for rs1653624 and rs3751143. Furthermore, 44 new cases of RA and 48 healthy controls were recruited to investigate whether P2X7 mRNA expression is associated with RA susceptibility. Results: The results revealed that the rs2393799 significantly increased the risk of RA in all genetic models (p<0.05), while rs3751143 in codominant (CC vs. AA, OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.26–0.92), dominant (AC+CC, OR=0.59, 95% CI=0.37–0.94), C allele (OR=0.63, 95% CI=0.46–0.88), and rs2230912 in codominant (AG vs. AA, OR=0.56, 95% CI=0.34–0.94), dominant (AG+GG vs. AA, OR=0.59, 95% CI=0.35–0.99), and overdominant (AG vs. AA+GG, OR=0.57, 95% CI=0.33–0.98) significantly decreased the RA risk (p<0.05). Furthermore, the rs1718119 and rs1653624 were not associated with susceptibility of RA (p>0.05), and rs28360457 and rs35933842 were not polymorphic in our study. The mRNA expression level of P2X7 in both groups revealed that the P2X7 gene was significantly upregulated in RA (3.18±0.43) compared to healthy subjects (1.47±0.15, p<0.001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that rs2393799, rs3751143, and rs2230912 variants of the P2X7 gene are associated with RA’s susceptibility in a sample of the Iranian population. Also, P2X7 mRNA expression was higher in our new RA patients.

Here we aimed to determine if cell survival is conferred by expression of a mitochondrial protein novel to the cardiac proteome, known as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, (StAR/STARD1). Further studies aimed to unravel the regulation and role of the non-steroidogenic cardiac StAR after MI. Methods and results: Following permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in mouse heart, timeline western blot analyses showed that StAR expression corresponds to the inflammatory response to MI. Following the identification of StAR in mitochondria of cardiac fibroblasts in culture, confocal microscopy immunohistochemistry (IHC) identified StAR expression in left ventricular (LV) activated interstitial fibroblasts, adventitial fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Further work with the primary fibroblasts model revealed that interleukin-1α (IL-1α) signaling via NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways efficiently upregulates the expression of the Star gene products. At the functional level, IL-1α primed fibroblasts were protected against apoptosis when exposed to cisplatin mimicry of in vivo apoptotic stress; yet, the protective impact of IL-1α was lost upon siRNA mediated StAR downregulation. At the physiological level, StAR expression was nullified during post-MI inflammation in a mouse model with global IL-1α deficiency, concomitantly resulting in a 4-fold elevation of apoptotic fibroblasts. Serial echocardiography and IHC studies of mice examined 24 days after MI revealed aggravation of LV dysfunction, LV dilatation, anterior wall thinning and adverse tissue remodeling when compared with loxP control hearts. Conclusions: This study calls attention to overlooked aspects of cellular responses evolved under the stress conditions associated with the default inflammatory response to MI. Our observations suggest that LV IL-1α is cardioprotective, and at least one mechanism of this action is mediated by induction of StAR expression in border zone fibroblasts, which renders them apoptosis resistant. This acquired survival feature also has long-term ramifications on the heart recovery by diminishing adverse remodeling and improving the heart function after MI.",Apoptosis | Cardiac fibroblasts | Cardiac remodeling | IL-1α | Myocardial infarction | StAR,1,0,NIH,R01 HL135657,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,1,2021-06-01

Caspase-1 also cleaves inactive precursors of the interleukin (IL)-1 family to generate mature cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Cleaved GSDMD forms transmembrane pores to enable the release of IL-1 and to drive cell lysis through pyroptosis1–9. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the pore and the prepore of GSDMD. These structures reveal the different conformations of the two states, as well as extensive membrane-binding elements including a hydrophobic anchor and three positively charged patches. The GSDMD pore conduit is predominantly negatively charged. By contrast, IL-1 precursors have an acidic domain that is proteolytically removed by caspase-110. When permeabilized by GSDMD pores, unlysed liposomes release positively charged and neutral cargoes faster than negatively charged cargoes of similar sizes, and the pores favour the passage of IL-1β and IL-18 over that of their precursors. Consistent with these findings, living—but not pyroptotic—macrophages preferentially release mature IL-1β upon perforation by GSDMD. Mutation of the acidic residues of GSDMD compromises this preference, hindering intracellular retention of the precursor and secretion of the mature cytokine. The GSDMD pore therefore mediates IL-1 release by electrostatic filtering, which suggests the importance of charge in addition to size in the transport of cargoes across this large channel.",,16,0,NIH,5T32HL066987-18,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,3,2021-05-01

However, over the past 20 years, several studies led to the realization that protein secretion as a process might not be as uniform among different cargos as once thought. While in classic canonical secretion proteins carry a signal sequence, the secretory or surface proteome of several organisms demonstrated a lack of such signals in several secreted proteins. Other proteins were found to indeed carry a leader sequence, but simply circumvent the Golgi apparatus, which in canonical secretion is generally responsible for the modification and sorting of secretory proteins after their passage through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These alternative mechanisms of protein translocation to, or across, the plasma membrane were collectively termed “unconventional protein secretion” (UPS). To date, many research groups have studied UPS in their respective model organism of choice, with surprising reports on the proportion of unconventionally secreted proteins and their crucial roles for the cell and survival of the organism. Involved in processes such as immune responses and cell proliferation, and including far more different cargo proteins in different organisms than anyone had expected, unconventional secretion does not seem so unconventional after all. Alongside mammalian cells, much work on this topic has been done on protist parasites, including genera Leishmania, Trypanosoma, Plasmodium, Trichomonas, Giardia, and Entamoeba. Studies on protein secretion have mainly focused on parasite-derived virulence factors as a main source of pathogenicity for hosts. Given their need to secrete a variety of substrates, which may not be compatible with canonical secretion pathways, the study of mechanisms for alternative secretion pathways is particularly interesting in protist parasites. In this review, we provide an overview on the current status of knowledge on UPS in parasitic protists preceded by a brief overview of UPS in the mammalian cell model with a focus on IL-1β and FGF-2 as paradigmatic UPS substrates.",glycolysis | host–pathogen interface | moonlighting | protist parasites | unconventional secretion,3,1,SNF,PR00P3_179813,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,citing papers,4,2021-05-01

This study aimed to explore the related mechanisms of intermittent FT for the treatment of IR. Methods: A rat IR model was established through collaboration of a high-fat diet with streptozotocin (STZ) injection. 8 rats were treated with intermittent FT. A positive control group was treated with metformin (MET). Mouse 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were cultured and induced into adipocytes in vitro, and were used as the cellular IR model. Blood insulin, glucose, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR index were determined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting were used to detect inflammatory markers. Oil Red O staining determined the lipid accumulation. An NLRP3 inflammasome agonist served to investigate the effects of FT on IR in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Results: The high levels of blood insulin, glucose, and HOMA-IR induced by high-fat diet and STZ were significantly decreased by FT. The FT also reduced the level of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, caspase-1, and increased the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), and IRS2 in both the rat models and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, FT significantly relieved lipid accumulation in the liver of rats. Application of NLRP3 inflammasome agonist weakened the effect of FT on IR in the IR 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Conclusions: These results suggest that FT can ameliorate the high-fat diet-and STZ-induced IR in rats through inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome.",Inflammation | Insulin resistance (IR) | Intermittent fasting therapy | NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) | Type 2 diabetes mellitus,0,1,,2016-148,,citing papers,5,2021-05-01

The aim of this work is to present a review of links between the NLRP3 inflammasome, endothelial dysfunction, and T2DM. The NLRP3 inflammasome activates caspase‐1, which leads to the maturation of pro‐inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β and interleukin 18. In this review, we characterize the structure and functions of NLRP3 inflammasome as well as the most important mechanisms and molecules engaged in its activation. We present evidence of the importance of the endothelial dysfunction as the first key step to activating the inflammasome, which suggests that suppressing the NLRP3 inflammasome could be a new approach in depletion hyperglycemic toxicity and in averting the onset of vascular complications in T2DM. We also demonstrate reports showing that the expression of a few microRNAs that are also known to be involved in either NLRP3 inflammasome activation or endothelial dysfunction is deregulated in T2DM. Collectively, this evidence suggests that T2DM is an inflammatory disease stimulated by pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Finally, studies revealing the role of glucose concentration in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome are analyzed.

As inflammasome dysregulation is increasingly associated with numerous autoinflammatory disorders, there is an urgent need for further research into the inflammasome's involvement in the pathogenesis of such diseases in order to identify novel therapeutic targets and treatments. The zebrafish has become a widely used animal model to study human diseases in recent years, and has already provided relevant findings in the field of inflammasome biology including the identification of new components and pathways. We provide a detailed analysis of current knowledge on neutrophil inflammasome biology and compare its features with those of the better known macrophage inflammasome, focusing on its contribution to innate immunity and its relevance for human health. Importantly, a large body of evidence points to a link between neutrophil inflammasome dysfunction and many neutrophil-mediated human diseases, but the real contribution of the neutrophil inflammasome to the pathogenesis of these disorders is largely unknown. Although neutrophils have remained in the shadow of macrophages and monocytes in the field of inflammasome research since the discovery of these multiprotein platforms, recent studies strongly suggest that the importance of the neutrophil inflammasome has been underestimated.",ASC | Inflammasome | Neutrophil | NLRC4 | NLRP3 | Zebrafish,1,0,MICINN,PITG-GA-2011-289209,Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación,citing papers,4,2021-02-01

Mechanistically, pyroptosis induction requires cleavage of the caspase substrate gasdermin D (GSDMD), and the release of the GSDMD N-terminal fragment, which targets the plasma membrane to form large β-barrel pores. GSDMD shares this pore-forming ability with other gasdermin family members, which induce pyroptosis during infection or upon treatment with chemotherapy drugs. While induction of cell death has been assumed to be the main function of the gasdermin pores, increasing evidence suggests that these pores have non-lytic functions, such as in releasing cytokines or alarmins and in regulating intracellular signaling via ionic fluxes.

The formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is central to pyroptosis, which may be induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Inflammasome formation, and by extension pyroptosis, may be inhibited by certain anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we present a single-cell mathematical model that captures the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and responses to anti-inflammatory intervention that hinder the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The model is formulated in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the dynamics of the key biological components involved in pyroptosis. Our results demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory drug can delay the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from inflammatory (pyroptosis) to non-inflammatory (e.g., apoptosis). The single-cell model is implemented within a SARS-CoV-2 tissue simulator, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary coalition investigating within host-dynamics of COVID-19.

We hypothesized that therapy with necrosulfonamide (NSA), a mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein inhibitor, would attenuate lung IRI. Methods: Rats were assigned at random into the sham operation group (n = 6), vehicle group (n = 8), or NSA group (n = 8). In the NSA and vehicle groups, the animals were heparinized and underwent left thoracotomy, and the left hilum was clamped for 90 minutes, followed by reperfusion for 120 minutes. NSA (0.5 mg/body) and a solvent were administered i.p. in the NSA group and the vehicle group, respectively. The sham group underwent 210 minutes of perfusion without ischemia. After reperfusion, arterial blood gas analysis, physiologic data, lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, histologic changes, and cytokine levels were assessed. Fluorescence double immunostaining was performed to evaluate necroptosis and apoptosis. Results: Arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was better, dynamic compliance was higher, and mean airway pressure and lung edema were lower in the NSA group compared with the vehicle group.

EVs represent one of the critical mechanisms mediating the cell-to-cell communication between ECs and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). However, whether or not the inflammasome-dependent EVs directly participate in the regulation of VSMC function remains unknown. In the present study, we found that in cultured carotid ECs, atherogenic stimulation by oxysterol 7-ketocholesterol (7-Ket) induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation and activation, reduced lysosome-multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fusion, and increased secretion of EVs that contain inflammasome product IL-1β. These EC-derived IL-1β-containing EVs promoted synthetic phenotype transition of co-cultured VSMCs, whereas EVs from unstimulated ECs have the opposite effects. Moreover, acid ceramidase (AC) deficiency or lysosome inhibition further exaggerated the 7-Ket-induced release of IL-1β-containing EVs in ECs. Using a Western diet (WD)-induced hypercholesterolemia mouse model, we found that endothelial-specific AC gene knockout mice (Asah1fl/fl/ECCre) exhibited augmented WD-induced EV secretion with IL-1β and more significantly decreased the interaction of MVBs with lysosomes in the carotid arterial wall compared to their wild-type littermates (WT/WT). The endothelial AC deficiency in Asah1fl/fl/ECCre mice also resulted in enhanced VSMC phenotype transition and accelerated neointima formation. Together, these results suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production during hypercholesterolemia promotes VSMC phenotype transition to synthetic status via EV machinery, which is controlled by lysosomal AC activity. Our findings provide novel mechanistic insights into understanding the pathogenic role of endothelial NLRP3 inflammasome in vascular injury through EV-mediated EC-to-VSMC regulation.",acid ceramidase | ceramide | endothelial cells | extracellular vesicles | lysosome,4,1,en:FNIH,undefined,Foundation for the National Institutes of Health,citing papers,4,2020-12-01

They are called unconventionally secreted proteins, and the best-characterized are from fungi and mammals. These proteins have extracellular functions including cell signaling, immune modulation, as well as moonlighting activities different from their well-described intracellular functions.

Whole blood samples from different donors were exposed ex vivo to different concentrations of PSNPs for 24, 48, or 72 h.

Recognition of PAMPs or DAMPs leads to formation of the inflammasome complex, which results in activation of caspase-1, followed by cleavage and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Excessive activation of NLRP3 inflammasome can contribute to development of inflammatory diseases and cancer. Autophagy is vital intracellular process for recycling and removal of damaged proteins and organelles, as well as destruction of intracellular pathogens. Cytosolic components are sequestered in a double-membrane vesicle—autophagosome, which then fuses with lysosome resulting in degradation of the cargo. The autophagy dysfunction can lead to diseases with hyperinflammation and excessive activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and thus acts as a major regulator of inflammasomes. Autophagic removal of NLRP3 inflammasome activators, such as intracellular DAMPs, NLRP3 inflammasome components, and cytokines can reduce inflammasome activation and inflammatory response. Likewise, inflammasome signaling pathways can regulate autophagic process necessary for balance between required host defense inflammatory response and prevention of excessive and detrimental inflammation. Autophagy has a protective role in some inflammatory diseases associated with NLRP3 inflammasome, including gouty arthritis, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), and sepsis.

DAMPs are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which mediate the initiation of an immune response and the release of inflammatory cytokines. The animal model of UUO is used for various purposes. UUO in adult mice serves as a model for accelerated renal fibrosis, which is a hallmark of progressive renal disease. UUO in adult mice enables to study cell death, inflammation, and extracellular matrix deposition in the kidney. Neonatal UUO is a model for congenital obstructive nephropathies. It studies inflammation, apoptosis, and interstitial fibrosis in the neonatal kidney, when nephrogenesis is still ongoing. Following UUO, several DAMPs as well as DAMP receptors are upregulated. In adult UUO, soluble uric acid is upregulated and activates the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which promotes fibrosis, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) injury. Further DAMPs associated with UUO are uromodulin, members of the IL-1 family, and necrotic cell DNA, all of which promote sterile inflammation. In neonatal UUO, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is highly upregulated. RAGE is a ligand for several DAMPs, including high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and S100 proteins, which play an important role in renal fibrosis. Additionally, necroptosis is an important mechanism of cell death, besides apoptosis, in neonatal UUO. It is highly inflammatory due to release of cytokines and specific DAMPs. The release and recognition of DAMPs initiate sterile inflammation, which makes them good candidates to develop and improve diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in renal fibrosis and congenital obstructive nephropathies.",damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) | inflammation | innate immunity | kidney | unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO),6,1,DFG,La 1257/5-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,citing papers,5,2020-10-01

Here, we found that nigericin, a toxin derived from Streptomyces hygroscopicus, promoted IL-33 translocation from the nucleus to the cytosol before extracellular release. This translocation was inhibited by chelating Ca2+ with EGTA or membrane protection by glycine treatment. Ca2+ ionophore A23187 stimulation caused IL-33 translocation to the cytoplasm but was not sufficient for extracellular release. However, IL-33 release was induced by detergent treatment, which indicates that membrane rupture is required for IL-33 release. The pore-forming pyroptosis executor gasdermin D was cleaved following nigericin stimulation, and overexpression of the cleaved gasdermin D-N-terminal fragment that forms the membrane pore sufficiently induced IL-33 release, which was blocked by EGTA and glycine.

In addition, caspase-1 cleaves the cytosolic protein, gasdermin-D (GSDMD), whose N-terminal fragment subsequently forms a pore in the plasma membrane, leading to the pyroptic cell-death-mediated release of IL-1β. Living cells can also release IL-1β via GSDMD pores or other unconventional secretory pathways. However, the precise mechanisms are poorly defined. Here, we show that lipoproteins from Mycoplasma salivarium (MsLP) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MpLP) and an M. salivarium-derived lipopeptide (FSL-1), which are activators of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, induce IL-1β release from mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) without inducing cell death. The levels of IL-1β release induced by MsLP, MpLP and FSL-1 were more than 100 times lower than those induced by the canonical NLRP3 activator nigericin. The IL-1β release-inducing activities of MsLP, MpLP and FSL-1 were not attenuated in BMMs from GSDMD-deficient mice. Furthermore, both active caspase-1 and cleaved GSDMD were detected in response to transfection of FSL-1 into the cytosol of BMMs, but the release of IL-1β was unaffected by GSDMD deficiency. Meanwhile, punicalagin, a membrane-stabilizing agent, drastically down-regulated the release of IL-1β in response to FSL-1. These results suggest that mycoplasmal lipoprotein/lipopeptide-induced IL-1β release by living macrophages is not mediated via GSDMD but rather through changes in membrane permeability.",gasdermin D | interleukin-1β | mycoplasmal lipopeptide | mycoplasmal lipoproteins | plasma membrane permeabilization,1,0,KAKEN,JP16H06280,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,citing papers,8,2020-10-01

This process helps maintain tissue homeostasis, supports recovery from acute injury, deals with infection and regulates immunity. Cell death can also provoke inflammatory responses, and lytic forms of cell death can incite inflammation. Loss of cell membrane integrity leads to the uncontrolled release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are normally sequestered inside cells. Such DAMPs increase local inflammation and promote the production of cytokines and chemokines that modulate the innate immune response. Cell death can be both a consequence and a cause of inflammation, which can be difficult to distinguish in chronic diseases. Despite this caveat, excessive or poorly regulated cell death is increasingly recognized as a contributor to chronic inflammation in rheumatic disease and other inflammatory conditions. Drugs that inhibit cell death could, therefore, be used therapeutically for the treatment of these diseases, and programmes to develop such inhibitors are already underway.

Exosomes were isolated from CM by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by western blotting, electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Soluble FAF1 from CM was immunodepleted using anti-FAF1 antibody. Transmission of secreted FAF1 was examined by transwell assay under a confocal microscope. CM-induced cell death was determined by measuring propidium iodide (PI) uptake using a flow cytometer. Results: FAF1 was secreted from SH-SY5Y cells via exocytosis and brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant secretory pathways. Furthermore, FAF1 was secreted as a vesicle-free form and a genuine exosome cargo in the lumen of exosomes. In addition, FAF1 increased the number of exosomes, suggesting a regulatory role in exosome biogenesis. Extracellular FAF1 was transmitted via endocytosis to neighboring cells, where it induced cell death through apoptotic and necrotic pathways.

Lysosomal exocytosis is a process leading to the secretion of lysosomal content upon lysosome fusion with plasma membrane and is an important mechanism of cellular clearance, necessary to maintain cell fitness. Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles originating from the inward budding of the membrane of late endosomes, which may not fuse with lysosomes but be released extracellularly upon exocytosis. In addition to garbage disposal tools, they are now considered a cell-to-cell communication mechanism. Autophagy is a cellular process leading to sequestration of cytosolic cargoes for their degradation within lysosomes. However, the autophagic machinery is also involved in unconventional protein secretion and autophagy-dependent secretion, which are fundamental mechanisms for toxic protein disposal, immune signalling and pathogen surveillance. These cellular processes underline the crosstalk between the autophagic and the endosomal system and indicate an intersection between degradative and secretory functions. Further, they suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying fusion, either with lysosomes or plasma membrane, are key determinants to maintain cell homeostasis upon stressing stimuli. When they fail, the accumulation of undigested substrates leads to pathological consequences, as indicated by the involvement of autophagic and lysosomal alteration in human diseases, namely lysosomal storage disorders, age-related neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

Pathogenic protein aggregates such as β-amyloid and α-synuclein trigger microglial NLRP3 activation, leading to caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. Both caspase-1 and IL-1β contribute to disease progression in the mouse SOD1G93A model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), suggesting a role for microglial NLRP3. Prior studies, however, suggested SOD1G93A mice microglia do not express NLRP3, and SOD1G93A protein generated IL-1β in microglia independent to NLRP3. Here, we demonstrate using Nlrp3-GFP gene knock-in mice that microglia express NLRP3 in SOD1G93A mice. We show that both aggregated and soluble SOD1G93A activates inflammasome in primary mouse microglia leading caspase-1 and IL-1β cleavage, ASC speck formation, and the secretion of IL-1β in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Importantly, SOD1G93A was unable to induce IL-1β secretion from microglia deficient for Nlrp3, or pretreated with the specific NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950, confirming NLRP3 as the key inflammasome complex mediating SOD1-induced microglial IL-1β secretion. Microglial NLRP3 upregulation was also observed in the TDP-43Q331K ALS mouse model, and TDP-43 wild-type and mutant proteins could also activate microglial inflammasomes in a NLRP3-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we identified the generation of reactive oxygen species and ATP as key events required for SOD1G93A-mediated NLRP3 activation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ALS microglia express NLRP3, and that pathological ALS proteins activate the microglial NLRP3 inflammasome.

However, cellular and molecular mechanisms by which chronic neuroinflammation is formed and maintained remain elusive. This study aimed to explore detailed mechanisms by which anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) prevented chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. At 24 h after an intranigral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), levels of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β, active caspase-1, and mature IL-1β in the midbrain were much higher in IL-10−/− mice than wildtype mice. Mechanistically, IL-10−/− microglia produced more intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) and showed more profound activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX2) than wildtype microglia. Meanwhile, suppression of NOX2-derived iROS production blocked LPS-elicited caspase-1 activation and IL-1β maturation in IL-10−/− microglia in vitro and in vivo. One month after intranigral LPS injection, IL-10−/− mice revealed more profound microglial activation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra than wildtype mice. Importantly, such PD-like pathological changes were prevented by IL-1β neutralization. Collectively, IL-10 inhibited LPS-elicited production of NOX2-derived iROS thereby suppressing synthesis of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1β and their activation and cleavage. By this mechanism, IL-10 prevented chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

In this study, through two independent mass spectrometry-based secretome screening approaches, we identified galectin-3 as an effector protein of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Although the activation of AIM2 or NLRC4 inflammasome also led to galectin-3 secretion, only the NLRP3 inflammasome controlled the serum galectin-3 level under physiological condition. Mechanistically, active gasdermin D drove the nonexosomal secretion of galectin-3 through the plasma membrane pores. In vivo, high-fat diet-fed Nlrp3-/- mice exhibited decreased circulating galectin-3 compared with wild-type animals. Of note, the improved insulin sensitivity in such Nlrp3-/- mice was aggravated by infusion of recombinant galectin-3. Moreover, galectin-3 was essential for insulin resistance induction in mice harboring the hyperactive Nlrp3A350V allele.

Although many principles of inflammasome activation have been described, mechanisms that limit inflammasome-dependent immune responses remain poorly defined. Here, we show that the thiol-specific peroxidase peroxiredoxin-4 (Prdx4) directly regulates IL-1β generation by interfering with caspase-1 activity. We demonstrate that caspase-1 and Prdx4 form a redox-sensitive regulatory complex via caspase-1 cysteine 397 that leads to caspase-1 sequestration and inactivation. Mice lacking Prdx4 show an increased susceptibility to LPS-induced septic shock. This effect was phenocopied in mice carrying a conditional deletion of Prdx4 in the myeloid lineage (Prdx4-ΔLysMCre). Strikingly, we demonstrate that Prdx4 co-localizes with inflammasome components in extracellular vesicles (EVs) from inflammasome-activated macrophages. Purified EVs are able to transmit a robust IL-1β-dependent inflammatory response in vitro and also in recipient mice in vivo. Loss of Prdx4 boosts the pro-inflammatory potential of EVs. These findings identify Prdx4 as a critical regulator of inflammasome activity and provide new insights into remote cell-to-cell communication function of inflammasomes via macrophage-derived EVs.",caspase-1 | extracellular vesicle | IL-1β | inflammasome | Prdx4,15,1,DFG,EXC2167,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,citing papers,0,2019-10-01

This study aimed to definitively test this hypothesis using cell type-specific IL-1α and IL-1R1-KO mouse models. A floxed Il1a mouse was created and used to generate a cardiomyocyte-specific IL-1α-KO (MIL1AKO) mouse line. A tamoxifen-inducible fibroblast-specific IL-1R1 hemizygous KO (FIL1R1KO) mouse line was also generated. Mice underwent experimental MI (permanent left anterior descending coronary artery ligation), and cardiac function was determined 4 weeks later by conductance pressure-volume catheter analysis. Molecular markers of remodeling were evaluated at various time points by real-time RT-PCR and histology. MIL1AKO mice showed no difference in cardiac function or molecular markers of remodeling after MI compared with littermate controls. In contrast, FIL1R1KO mice showed improved cardiac function and reduced remodeling markers after MI compared with littermate controls. In conclusion, these data highlight a key role for the IL-1R1/cardiac fibroblast signaling axis in regulating remodeling after MI and provide support for the continued development of anti-IL-1 therapies for improving cardiac function after MI.

Upon inflammasome assembly, procaspase 1 self-activates and renders functional cytokines to arbitrate in the defense mechanism. This assembly is mediated by self-association and protein interactions via Death Domains. The inflammasome plays a critical role in innate immunity and its dysregulation is the culprit of many autoimmune disorders. An in-depth understanding of the factors involved in inflammasome assembly could help fight these conditions.

The specific characteristics of the three-dimensional solution structure and interdomain dynamics of ASC are explained in relation to its function in inflammasome assembly.

In spite of these advantages, effects on other signalling pathways, prone to alkylation, may occur.

Chemoprevention has been the most effective strategy for lung cancer prevention. Thus, exploring novel and effective candidate agents with low toxicity for chemoprevention is essential and urgent. Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (H. cordata), which is a widely used herbal medicine and is also popularly consumed as a healthy vegetable, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumor activity. However, the chemopreventive effect of H. cordata against benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P)-initiated lung tumorigenesis and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Methods: A B[a]P-stimulated lung adenocarcinoma animal model in A/J mice in vivo and a normal lung cell model (BEAS.2B) in vitro were established to investigate the chemopreventive effects of H. cordata and its bioactive compound 2-undecanone against lung tumorigenesis and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Results: H. cordata and 2-undecanone significantly suppressed B[a]P-induced lung tumorigenesis without causing obvious systemic toxicity in mice in vivo. Moreover, H. cordata and 2-undecanone effectively decreased B[a]P-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction and further notably protected BEAS.2B cells from B[a]P-induced DNA damage and inflammation by significantly inhibiting phosphorylated H2A.X overexpression and interleukin-1β secretion. In addition, H. cordata and 2-undecanone markedly activated the Nrf2 pathway to induce the expression of the antioxidative enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1). Nrf2 silencing by transfection with Nrf2 siRNA markedly decreased the expression of HO-1 and NQO-1 to diminish the reductions in B[a]P-induced ROS overproduction, DNA damage and inflammation mediated by H. cordata and 2-undecanone. Conclusions: H. cordata and 2-undecanone could effectively activate the Nrf2-HO-1/NQO-1 signaling pathway to counteract intracellular ROS generation, thereby attenuating DNA damage and inflammation induced by B[a]P stimulation and playing a role in the chemoprevention of B[a]P-induced lung tumorigenesis.

P2X7 receptor has been linked to the elimination of Leishmania amazonensis. Biological responses evoked by P2X7 receptor activation have been well-documented, including apoptosis, phagocytosis, cytokine release, such as IL-1β. It was demonstrated that NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β signaling participated in resistance against L. amazonensis. Furthermore, our group has shown that L. amazonensis elimination through P2X7 receptor activation depended on leukotriene B4 (LTB4) production and release. Therefore, we investigated whether L. amazonensis elimination by P2X7 receptor and LTB4 involved NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β signaling. We showed that macrophages from NLRP3-/-, ASC-/-, Casp-1/11-/-, gp91phox-/-, and IL-1R-/- mice treated with ATP or LTB4 did not decrease parasitic load as was observed in WT mice. When ASC-/- macrophages were treated with exogenous IL-1β, parasite killing was noted, however, we did not see parasitic load reduction in IL-1R-/- macrophages. Similarly, macrophages from P2X7 receptor-defi-cient mice treated with IL-1β also showed decreased parasitic load. In addition, when we infected Casp-11-/- macrophages, neither ATP nor LTB4 were able to reduce parasitic load, and Casp-11-/- mice were more susceptible to L. amazonensis infection than were WT mice. Furthermore, P2X7-/- L. amazonensis-infected mice locally treated with exogenous LTB4 showed resistance to infection, characterized by lower parasite load and smaller lesions compared to untreated P2X7-/- mice.

Therefore, changes in FADD expression have dramatic cellular consequences. In mice and humans, FADD regulation can occur through protein secretion. However, the molecular mechanisms accounting for human FADD secretion were still unknown. Here we report that canonical, non-canonical, but not alternative, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human monocytes/macrophages induced FADD secretion. NLRP3 inflammasome activation by the bacterial toxin nigericin led to the proinflammatory interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release and to the induction of cell death by pyroptosis. However, we showed that FADD secretion could occur in absence of increased IL-1β release and pyroptosis and, reciprocally, that IL-1β release and pyroptosis could occur in absence of FADD secretion. Especially, FADD, but not IL-1β, secretion following NLRP3 inflammasome activation required extracellular glucose. Thus, FADD secretion was an active process distinct from unspecific release of proteins during pyroptosis. This FADD secretion process required K + efflux, NLRP3 sensor, ASC adaptor and CASPASE-1 molecule. Moreover, we identified FADD as a leaderless protein unconventionally secreted through microvesicle shedding, but not exosome release. Finally, we established human soluble FADD as a new marker of joint inflammation in gout and rheumatoid arthritis, two rheumatic diseases involving the NLRP3 inflammasome. Whether soluble FADD could be an actor in these diseases remains to be determined.

By far, the best studied and most characterized inflammasome is NLRP3 inflammasome, which consists of NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) and pyrin domain containing receptor 3), ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), and procaspase-1. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is mediated by highly diverse stimuli. Upon activation, NLRP3 protein recruits the adapter ASC protein, which recruits the procaspase-1 resulting in its cleavage and activation, inducing the maturation, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis. However, aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in various diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases; raising a tremendous clinical interest in exploring the potential inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome. Recent investigations have disclosed various inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway which were validated through in vitro studies and in vivo experiments in animal models of NLRP3-associated disorders. Some of these inhibitors directly target the NLRP3 protein whereas some are aimed at other components and products of the inflammasome. Direct targeting of NLRP3 protein can be a better choice because it can prevent off target immunosuppressive effects, thus restrain tissue destruction.

As a result, cells were susceptible to rupture by extrinsic forces, such as shear stress or compression. Cell analyses revealed that all major cytoskeleton components were disrupted during pyroptosis and that sensitivity to rupture was calpaindependent and linked with cleavage of vimentin and loss of intermediate filaments. Moreover, while release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), HMGB1, and IL-1β occurred without rupture, rupture was required for release of large inflammatory stimuli-ASC specks, mitochondria, nuclei, and bacteria.

Lacking a signal sequence, IL-1β does not follow the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi route. Several pathways have been proposed to mediate its release. One involves the translocation of pro-IL-1β into intracellular vesicles of lysosomal origin that eventually fuse with the plasma membrane. Another exploits pores formed on the plasma membrane upon proteolytic cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD). Here we investigated how primary monocytes—the main source of IL-1β in humans—control IL-1β release in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli of increasing intensity and found that two different routes are induced depending on the strength of activation. Triggering of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) by LPS induces slow IL-1β release through LAMP2A+ vesicles. In contrast, the simultaneous stimulation of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR7/8 drives high levels of ROS, GSDMD cleavage and faster IL-1β secretion. Drugs blocking ROS production prevent GSDMD cleavage supporting a role of oxidative stress in GSDMD-mediated secretion. Singly stimulated monocytes undergo apoptosis, whereas triple stimulation triggers pyroptosis, which might amplify inflammation. In both cases, however, IL-1β secretion precedes cell death. Inhibition of caspases 4/5 prevents GSDMD cleavage and pore-mediated secretion, but not vesicular release. The two pathways also display other distinct pharmacologic sensitivities that reflect the underlying mechanisms. Remarkably, single TLR4 stimulation is sufficient to activate massive, GSDMD-mediated IL-1β secretion in monocytes from patients affected by Cryopyrin Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS), an autoinflammatory disease linked to NLRP3 mutations. The exaggerated sensitivity to activation correlates with high basal ROS levels in CAPS monocytes. In conclusion, the vesicular pathway limits IL-1β release upon low pathogen load while stronger stimulation or concomitant cell stress induce instead uncontrolled secretion via GSDMD leading to detrimental inflammatory manifestations.",,28,1,AIRC,GGP14144,Fondazione Telethon,citing papers,3,2018-11-01

Mutations or SNPs in autoinflammatory genes including MEFV and NOD2 are linked to seronegative RA phenotypes including some so called palindromic RA cases. However, just as innate and adaptive immunity are closely functionally integrated, some ACPA+ RA cases have superimposed “autoinflammatory” features including abrupt onset attacks, severe attacks, self-limiting attacks, relevant autoinflammatory mutations or SNPs and therapeutic responses to autoinflammatory pathway therapies including colchicine and IL-1 pathway blockade. An emergent feature from this classification that non-destructive RA phenotypes, both innate and adaptive, have disease epicentres situated in the extracapsular tissues.

Here, we summarize the different mechanisms and pathways that have been proposed for IL-1β secretion. At least two of them, namely the endolysosomal vesicle-based and gasdermin D-dependent pathways (types III and I in the recent Rabouille's classification of unconventional protein secretion), can be triggered in monocytes, the main source of IL-1β in humans, according to the type and strength of the pro-inflammatory stimuli. As during the escalation of human conflicts, monocytes deploy secretory mechanisms of increasing efficiency and dangerousness, shifting from the specific and controlled type III pathway to the much faster release of type I. Thus, the different mechanisms are activated depending on the severity of the conditions, from the self-limiting type III pathways in response of low pathogen load or small trauma, to the uncontrolled responses that underlie autoinflammatory disorders and sepsis.",Autophagy | Gasdermin D | IL-1β | Secretory lysosomes | Vesicular secretion,19,0,AIRC,GGP14144,Fondazione Telethon,citing papers,6,2018-11-01

Surprisingly however, many proteins, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD)1, acyl-CoA binding protein (Acb1), interleukin 1β, fibroblast growth factor 2 and the adipokine Unpaired2, to name a few, are secreted even though they lack a signal sequence. The discovery that these proteins are secreted has presented a new challenge and we describe here a common pathway by which SOD1 and Acb1 are specifically secreted upon nutrient starvation. Their secretion follows a type III unconventional pathway, requiring the exposure of a di-acidic motif, which we propose promotes their capture into a membrane compartment called CUPS (compartment for unconventional protein secretion). We suggest that CUPS, composed of membranes derived from the Golgi apparatus and endosomes, serves as a major sorting station prior to release of SOD1 and Acb1 into the extracellular space. The trafficking of these signal sequence lacking proteins therefore has functional similarities to conventional protein secretion in that they rely on membrane bounded compartments for their sorting and transport, but bypass the need of Sec61 for translocating into the ER and COPII and COPI for their intracellular transfers.

Acute IL-1β secretion from inflammasome-activated macrophages requires caspase-1-dependent GSDMD cleavage, which also induces pyroptosis. Mechanisms of IL-1β secretion by pyroptotic and non-pyroptotic cells, and the precise functions of caspase-1 and GSDMD therein, are unresolved. Here, we show that, while efficient early secretion of endogenous IL-1β from primary non-pyroptotic myeloid cells in vitro requires GSDMD, later IL-1β release in vitro and in vivo proceeds independently of GSDMD. IL-1β maturation is sufficient for slow, caspase-1/GSDMD-independent secretion of ectopic IL-1β from resting, non-pyroptotic macrophages, but the speed of IL-1β release is boosted by inflammasome activation, via caspase-1 and GSDMD. IL-1β cleavage induces IL-1β enrichment at PIP2-enriched plasma membrane ruffles, and this is a prerequisite for IL-1β secretion and is mediated by a polybasic motif within the cytokine. We thus reveal a mechanism in which maturation-induced IL-1β trafficking facilitates its unconventional secretion. Interleukin-1β is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine whose dysregulated production drives a myriad of human diseases.

The lesional microenvironment contains a complex accumulation of variably oxidized lipids and cytokines. Infiltrating monocytes become polarized in response to these stimuli, resulting in a broad spectrum of macrophage phenotypes. The extent of lipid loading in macrophages influences their phenotype and consequently their inflammatory status. In response to excess atherogenic ligands, many normal cell processes become aberrant following a loss of homeostasis. This can have a direct impact upon the inflammatory response, and conversely inflammation can lead to cell dysfunction. Clear evidence for this exists in the lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria of atherosclerotic macrophages, the principal lesional cell type. Furthermore, several intrinsic cell processes become dysregulated under lipidotic conditions. Therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring cell function under disease conditions are an ongoing coveted aim. Macrophages play a central role in promoting lesional inflammation, with plaque progression and stability being directly proportional to macrophage abundance. Understanding how mixtures or individual lipid species regulate macrophage biology is therefore a major area of atherosclerosis research. In this review, we will discuss how the myriad of lipid and lipoprotein classes and products used to model atherogenic, proinflammatory immune responses has facilitated a greater understanding of some of the intricacies of chronic inflammation and cell function. Despite this, lipid oxidation produces a complex mixture of products and with no single or standard method of derivatization, there exists some variation in the reported effects of certain oxidized lipids. Likewise, differences in the methods used to generate macrophages in vitro may also lead to variable responses when apparently identical lipid ligands are used. Consequently, the complexity of reported macrophage phenotypes has implications for our understanding of the metabolic pathways, processes and shifts underpinning their activation and inflammatory status. Using oxidized low density lipoproteins and its oxidized cholesteryl esters and phospholipid constituents to stimulate macrophage has been hugely valuable, however there is now an argument that only working with low complexity lipid species can deliver the most useful information to guide therapies aimed at controlling atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications.",Atherosclerosis | Chronic inflammation | Lysosome dysfunction | Macrophage heterogeneity | Oxidized lipids,31,1,H2020,03/SAICT/2015,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme,citing papers,2,2018-06-01

Understanding the UPS pathways is not only important for elucidating the mechanisms of intracellular trafficking pathways but also has important ramifications for human health, because many of the proteins that are unconventionally secreted by mammalian cells and microorganisms are associated with human diseases, ranging from common inflammatory diseases to the lethal genetic disease of cystic fibrosis. Therefore, it is timely and appropriate to summarize and analyze the mechanisms of UPS involvement in disease pathogenesis, as they may be of use for the development of new therapeutic approaches.

The initial recognition integrates environmental cues derived from pathogen-associated molecular patterns and cell-intrinsic damage-associated molecular patterns to contextualize the insult and inform a tailored adaptive response via T and B lymphocytes. While there are much data to support the role of transcriptional responses downstream of pattern recognition receptors in informing the adaptive immune response, markedly less attention has been paid to the role of post-translational responses to pathogen-associated molecular pattern and damage-associated molecular pattern recognition by the innate immune system, and how this may influence adaptive immunity. A well-characterized post-translational consequence of pattern recognition receptor signaling is the assembly of a multimeric signaling platform, termed the inflammasome, by members of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (Nod), leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs), and pyrin and HIN domain (PYHIN) families. Inflammasomes assemble in response to cytosolic perturbations, such as mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant ion fluxes in the case of the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome or the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharides in the case of the non-canonical inflammasome. Assembly of the inflammasome allows for the cleavage and activation of inflammatory caspases. These activated inflammatory caspases in turn cleave pro-form inflammatory cytokines into their mature bioactive species and lead to unconventional protein secretion and lytic cell death. In this review, we discuss evidence for inflammasome-mediated instruction and contextualization of infectious and sterile agents to the adaptive immune system.",adaptive immunity | inflammasomes | innate immunity | SMOC | TLR,73,0,NIAID,R01AI093589,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,citing papers,3,2018-01-01

Drugs acting as NLRP3 blockers could represent innovative strategies for treatment of bowel inflammation. This study was performed in rats with dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS)-induced colitis, to investigate how the direct blockade of NLRP3 inflammasome with an irreversible inhibitor (INF39) compares with Ac-YVAD-cmk (YVAD, caspase-1 inhibitor) and anakinra (IL-1β receptor antagonist), acting downstream on NLRP3 signaling. Animals with DNBS-colitis received YVAD (3 mg/kg) or anakinra (100 mg/Kg) intraperitoneally, and INF39 (25 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (DEX, 1 mg/kg) orally for 6 days, starting on the same day of colitis induction. Under colitis, there was a body weight decrease, which was attenuated by YVAD, anakinra or INF39, but not DEX. All test drugs counteracted the increase in spleen weight. The colonic shortening and morphological colonic alterations associated with colitis were counteracted by INF39, anakinra and DEX, while YVAD was without effects. Tissue increments of myeloperoxidase, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1β were more effectively counteracted by INF39 and DEX, than YVAD and anakinra. These findings indicate that: (1) direct inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with INF39 is more effective than caspase-1 inhibition or IL-1β receptor blockade in reducing systemic and bowel inflammatory alterations; (2) direct NLRP3 inhibition can be a suitable strategy for treatment of bowel inflammation.",Anakinra | Bowel inflammation | Caspase-1 | Colitis | Colon | Interleukin-1beta | NLRP3 inflammasome,15,1,,undefined,,citing papers,4,2018-01-01

We show that neutrophil exposure to cytosolic lipopolysaccharide or cytosolic Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella sifA and Citrobacter rodentium) activates noncanonical (caspase-4/11) inflammasome signaling and triggers GSDMD-dependent neutrophil death. GSDMD-dependent death induces neutrophils to extrude antimicrobial NETs. Caspase-11 and GSDMD are required for neutrophil plasma membrane rupture during the final stage of NET extrusion. Unexpectedly, caspase-11 and GSDMD are also required for early features of NETosis, including nuclear delobulation and DNA expansion; this is mediated by the coordinate actions of caspase-11 and GSDMD in mediating nuclear membrane permeabilization and histone degradation. In vivo application of deoxyribonuclease I to dissolve NETs during murine Salmonella sifA challenge increases bacterial burden in wild-type but not in Casp11−/− and Gsdmd−/− mice.

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS), composed of a cluster of factors as obesity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension, is rapidly increasing in industrialized and developing countries leading to precocious onset of age-related diseases. Indeed, oxidative stress, accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts, and a chronic low-grade inflammation are common features of MS and physiological ageing. In particular, the entire set of MS factors contributes to the development of an inflammatory status named metaflammation, which has been associated with activation of early innate immune response through the assembling of the multiprotein complex inflammasome. The most investigated family of inflammasome platforms is the NOD-like receptor pyridine containing (NLRP) 3, which is activated by several exogenous and endogenous stimuli, leading to the sequential cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β, followed by secretion of active IL-1β. We here collect the most recent findings on NLRP3 activation in MS providing evidence of its central role in disease progression and organ dysfunction in target tissues of metaflammation, in particular in cardiovascular, hepatic and renal complications, with a focus on oxidative stress and advanced glycation endproducts. A wide overview of the most promising strategies for the modulation of NLRP3 activation and related metabolic repercussions is also provided, since the finding of specific pharmacological tools is an urgent requirement to reduce the social and economic burden of MS-and elderly-associated diseases.",Aging | Chronic kidney disease | Metabolic syndrome | Metaflammation | Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion | NLRP3 inflammasome | Oxidative stress | Steatohepatitis,32,0,,undefined,,citing papers,6,2018-01-01

In the present study, we clarified the effect of AMBN on the expression of an inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated human macrophages. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that LPS treatment upregulated expression of the IL-1β gene in U937 cells. Interestingly, AMBN significantly enhanced IL-1β gene expression in LPS-treated U937 cells as well as the secretion of mature IL-1β into culture supernatants by these cells. AMBN also activated caspase-1 p10 expression in LPS-treated U937 cells. Pretreatment with a caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK, downregulated the mature IL-1β expression enhanced by AMBN treatment in LPS-treated U937 cells. A co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that treatment with LPS and AMBN upregulated toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) interactions, but there was no significant difference compared with LPS treatment alone in U937 cells. In contrast, western blot analysis revealed that AMBN remarkably prolonged the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family. An ERK1/2-selective inhibitor, U0126, suppressed expression of the IL-1β gene as well as its protein expression in U937 cells treated with LPS and AMBN. Taken together, these results indicate that AMBN enhances IL-1β production in LPS-treated U937 cells through ERK1/2 phosphorylation and caspase-1 activation, suggesting that AMBN upregulates the inflammatory response in human macrophages and plays an important role in innate immunity.

Upon activation, a subset of NLR initiate the assembly of a multimeric protein complex known as the inflammasome, which processes pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediates a specialized form of cell death known as pyroptosis. The identification of inflammasome-associated genes as inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility genes implicates a role for the inflammasome in intestinal inflammation. Despite the fact that the functional importance of inflammasomes within immune cells has been well established, the contribution of inflammasome expression in non-hematopoietic cells remains comparatively understudied. Given that intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) act as a barrier between the host and the intestinal microbiota, inflammasome expression by these cells is likely important for intestinal immune homeostasis. Accumulating evidence suggests that the inflammasome plays a key role in shaping epithelial responses at the host-lumen interface with many inflammasome components highly expressed by IEC. Recent studies have exposed functional roles of IEC inflammasomes in mucosal immune defense, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. In this review, we present the main features of the predominant inflammasomes and their effector mechanisms contributing to intestinal homeostasis and inflammation.

This drives activation of caspase-1 or caspase-11/4/5, which cleave gasdermin D, separating its N-terminal pore-forming domain (PFD) from the C-terminal repressor domain (RD). The PFD oligomerizes to form large pores in the membrane that drive swelling and membrane rupture. Gasdermin D is one of six (in humans) gasdermin family members; several other gasdermins have also been shown to form pores that cause pyroptosis after cleavage to activate their PFDs. One of these, gasdermin E, is activated by caspase-3 cleavage. We review our current understanding of pyroptosis as well as current knowledge of the gasdermin family. Caspase-1-programmed cell death observed in 1992 was later termed pyroptosis to differentiate it from the morphologically distinct apoptosis. The pyroptosis effector remained unknown until 2015 when gasdermin D was discovered as a cleavage target for caspase-1 and -11. The N terminus of gasdermin D is a PFD that permeabilizes the plasma membrane, simultaneously releasing mature IL-1β and driving cell swelling until membrane rupture. Membrane rupture disperses soluble cytosolic contents. Organelles and intracellular bacteria remain trapped within the torn but largely intact plasma membrane. This PIT promotes transfer of trapped bacteria to neutrophils. Other gasdermin superfamily proteins have homologous, PFDs.

In silico analyses of protease target sites, together with cleavage experiments in vitro and in vivo, showed that p67-GBP-1 is cleaved by the inflammatory caspases 1 and 5, leading to the formation of p47-GBP-1. Furthermore, the secretion of p47-GBP-1 was found to occur via a non-classical secretion pathway and to be dependent on caspase-1 activity but independent of inflammasome activation.

Here I review new results and concepts that are beginning to define these pathways.",Golgi bypass | membrane-bound organelle | pore | stress | translocation | unconventional protein secretion,206,0,,undefined,,citing papers,4,2017-03-01

Necroptotic cell lysis, and resultant release of proinflammatory mediators, is thought to cause inflammation in necroptotic disease models. However, we previously showed that MLKL signaling can also promote inflammation by activating the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)- like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome to recruit the adaptor protein apoptosis-Associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) and trigger caspase-1 processing of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Here, we provide evidence that MLKL-induced activation of NLRP3 requires (i) the death effector four-helical bundle of MLKL, (ii) oligomerization and association of MLKL with cellular membranes, and (iii) a reduction in intracellular potassium concentration. Although genetic or pharmacological targeting of NLRP3 or caspase-1 prevented MLKLinduced IL-1β secretion, they did not prevent necroptotic cell death. Gasdermin D (GSDMD), the pore-forming caspase-1 substrate required for efficient NLRP3-Triggered pyroptosis and IL-1β release, was not essential for MLKL-dependent death or IL-1β secretion. Imaging of MLKL-dependent ASC speck formation demonstrated that necroptotic stimuli activate NLRP3 cell-intrinsically, indicating that MLKL-induced NLRP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1β cleavage occur before cell lysis. Furthermore, we show that necroptotic activation of NLRP3, but not necroptotic cell death alone, is necessary for the activation of NF-κB in healthy bystander cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential importance of NLRP3 inflammasome activity as a driving force for inflammation in MLKLdependent diseases.",Gasdermin D | Interleukin-1β | MLKL | Necroptosis | NLRP3,160,1,NIH,R37AI063331,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,2,2017-02-01

Opposing to that, human monocytes engage an alternative NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in response to LPS that proceeds in the absence of signal 2 activation and enables IL-1β secretion without pyroptosis. This specifically relies on Caspase-8 to propagate signaling to NLRP3, leading to inflammasome activation in absence of pyroptosome formation.

To address this issue, we generated a novel inflammasome independent system in which we directly activate caspase-1 by dimerization. In this system, caspase-1 dimerization induced the cleavage and secretion of IL-1β, which did not require processing of caspase-1 into its p20 and p10 subunits. Moreover, direct caspase-1 dimerization allowed caspase-1 activation of IL-1β to be separated from cell death. Specifically, we demonstrate at the single cell level that IL-1β can be released from live, metabolically active, cells following caspase-1 activation. In addition, we show that dimerized or endogenous caspase-8 can also directly cleave IL-1β into its biologically active form, in the absence of canonical inflammasome components. Therefore, cell death is not obligatory for the robust secretion of bioactive IL-1β.",,49,1,,undefined,,citing papers,1,2016-11-01

IL-1b is aberrantly activated in autoimmune diseases, and IL-1b inhibitors are used as therapeutic agents to treat patients with certain autoimmune disorders. Review of postmarketing surveillance of patients receiving IL-1b inhibitors found a disproportionate reporting of invasive infections by group A Streptococcus (GAS). IL-1b inhibition increased mouse susceptibility to GAS infection, but IL-1b was produced independent of canonical inflammasomes. Newly synthesized IL-1b has an amino-terminal prodomain that blocks signaling activity, which is usually proteolytically removed by caspase-1, a protease activated within the inflammasome structure. In place of host caspases, the secreted GAS cysteine protease SpeB generated mature IL-1b. During invasive infection, GAS isolates may acquire pathoadaptive mutations eliminating SpeB expression to evade detection by IL-1b. Pharmacological IL-1b inhibition alleviates this selective pressure, allowing invasive infection by nonpatho-adapted GAS. Thus, IL-1b is a sensor that directly detects pathogen-associated proteolysis through an independent pathway operating in parallel with host inflammasomes. Because IL-1b function is maintained across species, yet cleavage by caspases does not appear to be, detection of microbial proteases may represent an ancestral system of innate immune regulation.",,56,0,NIH,AI052453,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,7,2016-01-01
