Abnormal activation of the inflammasome leads to many inflammatory diseases, including gout, silicosis, neurodegeneration, and genetically inherited periodic fever syndromes. Therefore, identification of small molecule inhibitors that target the inflammasome is an important step toward developing effective therapeutics for the treatment of inflammation. Here, we show that the herbal NF-κB inhibitory compound parthenolide inhibits the activity of multiple inflammasomes in macrophages by directly inhibiting the protease activity of caspase-1. Additional investigations of other NF-κB inhibitors revealed that the synthetic IκB kinase-κinhibitor Bay 11-7082 and structurally related vinyl sulfone compounds selectively inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity in macrophages independent of their inhibitory effect on NF-κB activity. In vitro assays of the effect of parthenolide and Bay 11-7082 on the ATPase activity of NLRP3 demonstrated that both compounds inhibit the ATPase activity of NLRP3, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of these compounds on inflammasome activity could be mediated in part through their effect on the ATPase activity of NLRP3. Our results thus elucidate the molecular mechanism for the therapeutic anti-inflammatory activity of parthenolide and identify vinyl sulfones as a new class of potential therapeutics that target the NLRP3 inflammasome. © 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,326,1,NIA,R01AG014357,National Institute on Aging,origin paper,4,2010-03

With reduction of Prkar1a expression, we observed a significant upregulation of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. In wild type mice receiving a continuous infusion of insulin by mini-osmotic pump, we observed a 2-fold increase in the level of circulating ketones and a more than 40-fold increase in Kiss1 expression with reduction of Prkar1a. Loss of Prkar1a in the Sur1-/- mouse model of KATP hyperinsulinism significantly attenuated fasting induced hypoglycemia, decreased the insulin/ glucose ratio, and also increased the hepatic expression of Kiss1 by more than 10-fold.

The cellular response to stress (endoplasmic reticulum (ER), oxidative, inflammatory) is essential to sustain normal β cell function and survival. Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) are transcription factors implicated in β cell survival and susceptibility to stress. Our goal was to determine if a PDX1-ATF transcriptional complex or complexes regulate β cell survival in response to stress and to identify direct transcriptional targets. Methods: Pdx1, Atf4 and Atf5 were silenced by viral delivery of gRNAs or shRNAs to Min6 insulinoma cells or primary murine islets. Gene expression was assessed by qPCR, RNAseq analysis, and Western blot analysis. Chromatin enrichment was measured in the Min6 β cell line and primary isolated mouse islets by ChIPseq and ChIP PCR. Immunoprecipitation was used to assess interactions among transcription factors in Min6 cells and isolated mouse islets. Activation of caspase 3 by immunoblotting or by irreversible binding to a fluorescent inhibitor was taken as an indication of commitment to an apoptotic fate. Results: RNASeq identified a set of PDX1, ATF4 and ATF5 co-regulated genes enriched in stress and apoptosis functions. We further identified stress induced interactions among PDX1, ATF4, and ATF5. PDX1 chromatin occupancy peaks were identified over composite C/EBP-ATF (CARE) motifs of 26 genes; assessment of a subset of these genes revealed co-enrichment for ATF4 and ATF5. PDX1 occupancy over CARE motifs was conserved in the human orthologs of 9 of these genes. Of these, Glutamate Pyruvate Transaminase 2 (Gpt2), Cation transport regulator 1 (Chac1), and Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 1 (Slc7a1) induction by stress was conserved in human islets and abrogated by deficiency of Pdx1, Atf4, and Atf5 in Min6 cells. Deficiency of Gpt2 reduced β cell susceptibility to stress induced apoptosis in both Min6 cells and primary islets. Conclusions: Our results identify a novel PDX1 stress inducible complex (es) that regulates expression of stress and apoptosis genes to govern β cell survival.",Apoptosis | Pancreas | Stress | Transcriptional regulation | β cell,10,1,NIH,DK019525,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2018-11

The homeodomain transcription factor and human diabetes gene pancreas/duodenum homeobox protein 1 (Pdx1) regulates β-cell survival and endoplasmic reticulum stress susceptibility, in part through direct regulation of activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4). Here we show that Atf5, a close but less-studied relative of Atf4, is also a target of Pdx1 and is critical for β-cell survival under stress conditions. Pdx1 deficiency led to decreased Atf5 transcript, and primary islet ChIP-sequencing localized PDX1 to the Atf5 promoter, implicating Atf5 as a PDX1 target. Atf5 expression was stress inducible and enriched in β cells. Importantly, Atf5 deficiency decreased survival under stress conditions. Loss-of-function and chromatin occupancy experiments positioned Atf5 downstream of and parallel to Atf4 in the regulation of eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4ebp1), a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway component that inhibits protein translation. Accordingly, Atf5 deficiency attenuated stress suppression of global translation, likely enhancing the susceptibility of β cells to stress-induced apoptosis.

LIM domain-binding protein 1 (LDB1) nucleates multimeric transcriptional complexes and establishes promoter-enhancer looping, thereby directing fate assignment and maturation of progenitor populations. Many terminally differentiated endocrine cell types, however, remain enriched for LDB1, but its role is unknown. Here, we have demonstrated a requirement for LDB1 in maintaining the terminally differentiated status of pancreatic β cells. Inducible ablation of LDB1 in mature β cells impaired insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Transcriptomic analysis of LDB1-depleted β cells revealed the collapse of the terminally differentiated gene program, indicated by a loss of β cell identity genes and induction of the endocrine progenitor factor neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3). Lineage tracing confirmed that LDB1-depleted, insulin-negative β cells express NEUROG3 but do not adopt alternate endocrine cell fates. In primary mouse islets, LDB1 and its LIM homeodomain- binding partner islet 1 (ISL1) were coenriched at chromatin sites occupied by pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6.1), forkhead box A2 (FOXA2), and NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.2) - factors that co-occupy active enhancers in 3D chromatin domains in human islets. Indeed, LDB1 was enriched at active enhancers in human islets.

How NLRP3 senses these various stimuli is still poorly understood, but mitochondria and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species have been proposed to play a critical role in NLRP3 activation. In this article, we provide evidence that the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein MAVS associates with NLRP3 and facilitates its oligomerization leading to caspase-1 activation. In reconstituted 293T cells, full-length MAVS promoted NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation, whereas a C-terminal transmembrane domain-truncated mutant of MAVS (MAVS-DTM) did not. MAVS, but not MAVSDTM, interacted with NLRP3 and triggered the oligomerization of NLRP3, suggesting that mitochondrial localization of MAVS and intact MAVS signaling are essential for activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Supporting this, activation of MAVS signaling by Sendai virus infection promoted NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation, whereas knocking down MAVS expression clearly attenuated the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome by Sendai virus in THP-1 and mouse macrophages. Taken together, our results suggest that MAVS facilitates the recruitment of NLRP3 to the mitochondria and may enhance its oligomerization and activation by bringing it in close proximity to mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.

It is also involved in the pathogenesis of a number of human diseases, including gouty arthritis, silicosis, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes. The assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome requires a priming signal derived from pattern recognition or cytokine receptors, followed by a second signal derived from extracellular ATP, pore-forming toxins, or crystalline materials. How these two signals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome is not yet clear. Here, we show that in mouse macrophages, signaling by the pattern recognition receptor TLR4 through MyD88 can rapidly and non-transcriptionally prime NLRP3 by stimulating its deubiquitination. This process is dependent on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and can be inhibited by antioxidants. We further show that signaling by ATP can also induce deubiquitination of NLRP3 by a mechanism that is not sensitive to antioxidants. Pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 deubiquitination completely blocked NLRP3 activation in both mouse and human cells, indicating that deubiquitination of NLRP3 is required for its activation. Our findings suggest that NLRP3 is activated by a two-step deubiquitination mechanism initiated by Toll-like receptor signaling and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and further potentiated by ATP, which could explain how NLRP3 is activated by diverse danger signals. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,422,1,NIA,R01AG014357,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,2,2012-10

Here, we demonstrate that PSTPIP1 requires the familial Mediterranean fever protein pyrin to assemble the ASC pyroptosome, a molecular platform that recruits and activates caspase-1. We provide evidence that pyrin is a cytosolic receptor for PSTPIP1. Pyrin exists as a homotrimer in an autoinhibited state due to intramolecular interactions between its pyrin domain (PYD) and B-box. Ligation by PSTPIP1, which is also a homotrimer, activates pyrin by unmasking its PYD, thereby allowing it to interact with ASC and facilitate ASC oligomerization into an active ASC pyroptosome. Because of their high binding affinity to pyrin's B-box, PAPA-associated PSTPIP1 mutants were found to be more effective than WT PSTPIP1 in inducing pyrin activation.

Understanding the pathways that control NLRP3 activation will help develop strategies to treat these diseases. Here we identify WNK1 as a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Macrophages deficient in WNK1 protein or kinase activity have increased NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis compared with control macrophages. Mice with conditional knockout of WNK1 in macrophages have increased IL-1β production in response to NLRP3 stimulation compared with control mice. Mechanistically, WNK1 tempers NLRP3 activation by balancing intracellular Cl– and K+ concentrations during NLRP3 activation.

GSDME deficiency also accelerates cell growth in culture and in a mouse model of melanoma.

Conversely, depletion of SENP7 suppresses NLRP3-dependent ASC oligomerisation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism by which IL-4 signaling antagonizes proinflammatory responses is poorly characterized. In particular, whether IL-4 can modulate inflammasome signaling remains unknown. Here, we provide evidence that IL-4 suppresses NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation and the subsequent IL-1β secretion but does not inhibit absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-or NLRC4 (NOD-like receptor family, CARD domain-containing 4)-dependent caspase-1 activation in THP-1 and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or LPS/ATP stimulation, IL-4 markedly inhibited the assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome, including NLRP3-dependent ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) oligomerization, NLRP3-ASC interaction and NLRP3 speck-like oligomeric structure formation. The negative regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome by IL-4 was not due to the impaired mRNA or protein production of NLRP3 and proinflammatory cytokines. Supporting this observation, IL-4 attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation even in reconstituted NLRP3-expressing macrophages in which NLRP3 expression is not transcriptionally regulated by TLR-NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, the IL-4-mediated suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome was independent of STAT6-dependent transcription and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Instead, IL-4 inhibited subcellular redistribution of NLRP3 into mitochondria and microtubule polymerization upon NLRP3-activating stimulation. Our results collectively suggest that IL-4 could suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a transcription-independent manner, thus providing an endogenous regulatory machinery to prevent excessive inflammasome activation.",,32,0,NIAMS,R01AR055398,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,papers by authors,3,2015-07

The NLRP3 inflammasome, a multiprotein scaffolding complex that assembles in response to two distinct steps, priming and activation, is required for caspase-1 activation. However, the detailed mechanisms of these steps remain poorly characterized. To investigate the process of LPS-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome priming, we used constitutively present pro-IL-18 as the caspase-1-specific substrate to allow study of the early events.We analyzed human monocyte caspase-1 activity in response to LPS priming, followed by activation with ATP. Within minutes of endotoxin priming, the NLRP3 inflammasome is licensed for ATP-induced release of processed IL-18, apoptosis-associated speck-forming complex containing CARD, and active caspase-1, independent of new mRNA or protein synthesis. Moreover, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) phosphorylation is central to the priming process. ERK inhibition and small interfering RNA-mediated ERK1 knockdown profoundly impair priming. In addition, proteasome inhibition prevents ERK phosphorylation and blocks priming. Scavenging reactive oxygen species with diphenylene iodonium also blocks both priming and ERK phosphorylation. These findings suggest that ERK1-mediated posttranslational modifications license the NLRP3 inflammasome to respond to the second signal ATP by inducing posttranslational events that are independent of new production of pro-IL-1β and NOD-like receptor components.

Our previous studies showed that loss of the enzymatic activity of HTRA2 due to a Ser276Cys missense mutation in its catalytic domain is associated with early onset neurodegeneration, multiple tissue atrophy and premature lethality in homozygous htra2mnd2 mice, suggesting that HTRA2 is neuroprotective. To further investigate the role of HTRA2 in neuronal cell survival and the impact of its loss of function in nonneuronal tissues of adult mice, we generated transgenic htra2mnd2 mice expressing a neuron-targeted human HTRA2 transgene. Notably, this HTRA2 transgene rescues htra2mnd2 mice from early onset neurodegeneration, and other phenotypic abnormalities and prevents their early death, indicating that HTRA2 activity in neuronal mitochondria is important for neuronal cell survival. However, as the rescued htra2mnd2 mice grow older they exhibit specific phenotypic abnormalities indicative of premature aging. These include premature weight loss, osteoporosis, lordokyphosis, muscle atrophy, heart enlargement, increased autophagy and reduced life span. There is also a significant increase in the levels of clonally expanded mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions in their tissues.

Pneumolysin (PLY), a cytolysin produced by all clinical isolates of the pneumococcus, is one of the most important virulence factors of this pathogen. We have previously reported that PLY is an essential factor for activation of caspase-1 and consequent secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in macrophages infected with S. pneumoniae. However, the host molecular factors involved in caspase-1 activation are still unclear. To further elucidate the mechanism of caspase-1 activation in macrophages infected with S. pneumoniae, we examined the involvement of inflammasomes in inducing this cellular response. Our study revealed that apoptosis-associated specklike protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), an adaptor protein for inflammasome receptors such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), is essentially required for the induction of caspase-1 activation by S. pneumoniae. Caspase-1 activation was partially impaired in NLRP3 -/- macrophages, whereas knockdown and knockout of AIM2 resulted in a clear decrease in caspase-1 activation in response to S. pneumoniae. These results suggest that ASC inflammasomes, including AIM2 and NLRP3, are critical for caspase-1 activation induced by S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, ASC -/- mice were more susceptible than wild-type mice to S. pneumoniae, with impaired secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 into the bronchoalveolar lavage after intranasal infection, suggesting that ASC inflammasomes contribute to the protection of host from infection with PLY-producing S. pneumoniae.

We have identified a gene with homology to Escherichia coli mviN, a putative lipid II flippase, which F. tularensis uses to evade activation of innate immune pathways. Infection of mice with a F. tularensis mviNmutant resulted in improved survival and decreased bacterial burdens compared to infection with wild-type F. tularensis. The mviN mutant also induced increased absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion and cytotoxicity in macrophages. The compromised in vivo virulence of the mviN mutant depended upon inflammasome activation, as caspase 1- and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain-deficient mice did not exhibit preferential survival following infection. This study demonstrates that mviN limits F. tularensis-induced absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome activation, which is critical for its virulence in vivo.

Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to Listeria, leading to a potentially fatal infection. Cytosolic Listeria activates the proinflammatory caspase-1 and induces the processing and secretion of interleukins IL-1β and IL-18 as well as caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis. This study elucidates the role of various inflammasome components of host macrophages in the proinflammatory response to infection with Listeria. Here, we have used macrophages from AIM2-, NLRC4-, NLRP3-, and ASC-deficient mice to demonstrate that AIM2, NLRC4, and NLRP3 inflammasomes as well as the adaptor protein ASC all contribute to activation of caspase-1 in Listeria-infected macrophages. We show that Listeria DNA, which escapes into the cytosol of infected macrophages, triggers AIM2 oligomerization, caspase-1 activation, and pyroptosis. Interestingly, we found that flagellin-deficient Listeria, like Francisella tularensis, is recognized primarily by the AIM2 inflammasome, as no caspase-1 activation or cell death was observed in AIM2-deficient macrophages infected with this Listeria mutant. We further show that prior priming of NLRC4-deficient macrophages with LPS is sufficient for Listeria-induced caspase-1 activation in these macrophages, suggesting that TLR4 signaling is important for activation of the AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes by Listeria in the absence of NLRC4. Taken together, our results indicate that Listeria infection is sensed by multiple inflammasomes that collectively orchestrate a robust caspase-1 activation and proinflammatory response. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",AIM2 | caspase-1 | inflammasome | innate immunity | Listeria monocytogenes | NLRs | pyroptosis,182,0,NIH,R01AG014357,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2010-09

To gain insight into the pathophysiology of an atypical familial form of an autoinflammatory disorder, characterized by autosomal-dominant sensorineural hearing loss, systemic inflammation, increased secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and the absence of any cutaneous manifestations, and to assess the functional consequences of a missense mutation identified in the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain of NLRP3. Methods. Microsatellite markers were used to test the familial segregation of the NLRP3 locus with the disease phenotype. All NLRP3 exons were screened for mutations by sequencing. Functional assays were performed in HEK 293T cells to determine the effects of mutated (versus normal) NLRP3 proteins on NF-κB activation, caspase 1 signaling, and speck formation. Results. A heterozygous NLRP3 missense mutation (p.Tyr859Cys) was identified in exon 6, which encodes the LRR domain of the protein. This mutation was found to segregate with the disease phenotype within the family, and had a moderate activating effect on speck formation and procaspase 1 processing and did not alter the inhibitory properties of NLRP3 on NF-κB signaling. Conclusion. This report is the first to describe a familial form of a cryopyrinopathy associated with a mutation outside of exon 3 of NLRP3. This finding, together with the known efficacy of anti - IL-1 treatments in these disorders, underlines the importance of screening all exons of NLRP3 in patients who present with atypical manifestations. In addition, the gain of function associated with this mutation in terms of activation of caspase 1 signaling was consistent with the observed inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, this study of the functional consequences of an LRR mutation sheds new light on the clinical relevance of in vitro assays. © 2010, American College of Rheumatology.",,22,1,NIAMS,R01AR055398,National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases,papers by authors,4,2010-04

The nature of the cytoplasmic-DNA- sensing inflammasome is currently unknown. Here we show that AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2), an interferon-inducible HIN-200 family member that contains an amino-terminal pyrin domain and a carboxy-terminal oligonucleotide/ oligosaccharide-binding domain, senses cytoplasmic DNA by means of its oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding domain and interacts with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) through its pyrin domain to activate caspase-1. The interaction of AIM2 with ASC also leads to the formation of the ASC pyroptosome, which induces pyroptotic cell death in cells containing caspase-1. Knockdown of AIM2 by short interfering RNA reduced inflammasome/pyroptosome activation by cytoplasmic DNA in human and mouse macrophages, whereas stable expression of AIM2 in the non-responsive human embryonic kidney 293T cell line conferred responsiveness to cytoplasmic DNA. Our results show that cytoplasmic DNA triggers formation of the AIM2 inflammasome by inducing AIM2 oligomerization. This study identifies AIM2 as an important inflammasome component that senses potentially dangerous cytoplasmic DNA, leading to activation of the ASC pyroptosome and caspase-1. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Until recently, little was known about the mechanism by which caspase-1 is specifically activated to induce pyroptosis. Using biochemical and time-lapse confocal bioimaging approaches, it has been shown that caspase-1 is activated during pyroptosis by a large supramolecular assembly termed the pyroptosome. Biochemical and mass spectroscopic analyses revealed that the pyroptosome assembly is an oligomer of dimers of the adaptor protein ASC. Only one distinct pyroptosome is formed in each cell when macrophages or monocytes are stimulated with proinflammatory stimuli, which rapidly recruits and activates caspase-1, resulting in pyroptosis. This chapter describes methods for real-time observation and recording of the pyroptosome assembly process in live THP-1 monocytes. It also describes biochemical methods for the assembly, purification, and assay of the ASC pyroptosome from the THP-1 cell line, which could be adapted for use with other cell lines containing ASC, such as primary mouse macrophages. Finally, it describes methods for the in vitro reconstitution of a functional ASC pyroptosome from the recombinant ASC protein produced in Escherichia coli. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In Drosophila, the role of mitochondria in cell death is less clear. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the Drosophila ortholog of human Omi/HtrA2. We show that Drosophila Omi/HtrA2 is imported into the mitochondria where it undergoes proteolytic maturation to yield two isoforms, dOmi-L and dOmi-S. dOmi-L contains a canonical N-terminal IAP-binding motif (AVVS), whereas dOmi-S contains a distinct N-terminal motif (SKMT). DIAP1 was able to bind to both isoforms via its BIR1 and BIR2 domains. This resulted in cleavage of the linker region of DIAP1 between the BIR1 and BIR2 domains and further degradation of the BIR1 domain by the proteolytic activity of dOmi. The binding of DIAP1 to dOmi also resulted in DIAP1-mediated polyubiquitination of dOmi, suggesting that DIAP1 could target dOmi for proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this, expression of DIAP1 in Drosophila eye discs protected them from dOmi-induced eye ablation, indicating that DIAP1 plays an important role in protecting cells from the potentially lethal effects of dOmi. The ability of IAPs to bind to and ubiquitinate mitochondrial proteins such as dOmi may be a key conserved function to counterbalance the lethal effects of these proteins if accidentally released into the cytosol.",,22,1,NSF,IOB-0416760,National Science Foundation,papers by authors,8,2008-06

Current advances in the function of NALPs support the recently proposed model of a disease continuum bridging autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. Among these diseases, hereditary periodic fevers (HPFs) are Mendelian disorders associated with sequence variations in very few genes; these variations are mostly missense mutations whose deleterious effect, which is particularly difficult to assess, is often questionable. The growing number of identified sporadic cases of periodic fever syndrome, together with the lack of discriminatory clinical criteria, has greatly hampered the identification of new disease-causing genes, a step that is, however, essential for appropriate management of these disorders. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified nonambiguous mutations in NALP12 (i.e., nonsense and splice site) in two families with periodic fever syndromes. As shown by means of functional studies, these two NALP12 mutations have a deleterious effect on NF-κB signaling. Overall, these data identify a group of HPFs defined by molecular defects in NALP12, opening up new ways to manage these disorders. The identification of these first NALP12 mutations in patients with autoinflammatory disorder also clearly demonstrates the crucial role of NALP12 in inflammatory signaling pathways, thereby assigning a precise function to this particular member of an emerging family of proteins whose putative biological properties are currently inferred essentially through in vitro means. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Autoinflammatory disorder | CATERPILLER | Genetics | Mendelian disorder | NLRP,266,1,NIA,R01AG014357,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,9,2008-02

The adapter protein ASC binds directly to caspase-1 and is critical for caspase-1 activation in response to a broad range of stimuli. To elucidate the mechanism of activation of caspase-1 by ASC and its exact role in macrophage pyroptosis, we performed time-lapse confocal bioimaging analysis on human THP-1 macrophages stably expressing an ASC-GFP fusion protein. We show that stimulation of these cells with several proinflammatory stimuli trigger the formation of a large supramolecular assembly of ASC, termed here pyroptosome. Only one distinct pyroptosome in each stimulated cell is formed, which rapidly recruits and activates caspase-1 resulting in pyroptosis and the release of the intracellular proinflammatory cytokines. The pyroptosome is largely composed of oligomerized ASC dimers. Dimerization of ASC is driven by subphysiological concentrations of potassium as in vitro incubation of purified recombinant ASC in the presence of subphysiological concentrations of potassium induces the assembly of a functional pyroptosome. Furthermore, stimulation of potassium efflux in THP-1 cells with potassium-depleting agents induces formation of the pyroptosome, while increasing potassium concentrations in the culture medium or pharmacological inhibition of this efflux inhibits its assembly. Our results establish that macrophage pyroptosis is mediated by a unique pyroptosome, distinct from the inflammasome.",,616,1,NIH,R01AG014357,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,10,2007-09

However, both cryopyrin and two disease-associated cryopyrin mutants induced ASC oligomerization and ASC-dependent caspase-1 activation, with the disease-associated mutants being more potent than the wild-type (WT) cryopyrin, because of increased self-oligomerization. Contrary to the proposed anti-inflammatory activity of WT pyrin, our results demonstrated that pyrin, like cryopyrin, can also assemble an inflammasome complex with ASC and procaspase-1 leading to ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1β processing.

Presenilins play an important role in amyloid β-precursor processing, NOTCH receptor signaling, and apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanisms by which presenilins regulate apoptosis are not fully understood. Here, we report that presenilin-1 (PS1) regulates the proteolytic activity of the serine protease Omi/HtrA2 through direct interaction with its regulatory PDZ domain. We show that a peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of PS1 dramatically increases the proteolytic activity of Omi/HtrA2 toward the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins and β-casein and induces cell death in an Omi/HtrA2-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, ectopic expression of full-length PS1, but not PS1 lacking the C-terminal PDZ binding motif, potentiated Omi/HtrA2-induced cell death. Our results suggest that the C terminus of PS1 is an activation peptide ligand for the PDZ domain of Omi/ HtrA2 and may regulate the protease activity of Omi/ HtrA2 after its release from the mitochondria during apoptosis. This mechanism of Omi/HtrA2 activation is similar to the mechanism of activation of the related bacterial DegS protease by the outer-membrane porins.",,80,1,NIA,R01AG013487,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,12,2004-10

We show here that caspase-2 engages the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway by inducing the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c) and other mitochondrial apoptogenic factors into the cell cytoplasm. In support of these observations we found that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL can block caspase-2- and CRADD (caspase and RIP adaptor with death domain)-induced cell death. Unlike caspase-8, which can process all known caspase zymogens directly, caspase-2 is completely inactive toward other caspase zymogens. However, like caspase-8, physiological levels of purified caspase-2 can cleave cytosolic Bid protein, which in turn can trigger the release of Cyt c from isolated mitochondria. Interestingly, caspase-2 can also induce directly the release of Cyt c, AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor), and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases protein) from isolated mitochondria independent of Bid or other cytosolic factors. The caspase-2-released Cyt c is sufficient to activate the Apaf-caspase-9 apoptosome in vitro. In combination, our data suggest that caspase-2 is a direct effector of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.",,436,1,NIA,R01AG014357,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,14,2002-04

However, it is unclear whether Bax translocation is associated with Bax induction by DNA damaging agents. The induction of Bax in response to DNA damaging agents has been considered to be linked with p53. In this study, we used the p53 negative human chronic myeloid leukaemia K562 cell line. Bax up-regulation occurred at the whole cell level after DNA damage induced by etoposide. However, after incubation with etoposide, Bax failed to translocate to mitochondria and as a result, the apoptotic process was blocked. A Bax stable transfectant, the K/Bax cell line, expressed more Bax protein in the cytosol, mitochondria and nuclei. This Bax overexpression induced cytochrome c release, a reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). However, Bax-induced apoptosis was blocked downstream of mitochondria in K562 cells. The increased levels of mitochondrial Bax sensitized cells to etoposide-induced activation of caspases-2, -3 and -9 and apoptosis. However, after transient transfection with the Apaf-1 gene, K/Bax cells were sensitized to etoposide-induced caspase activation and apoptosis to a larger extent compared with Bax or Apaf-1 transfection alone. We therefore conclude that two mechanisms contribute to the resistance of K562 cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis; firstly failure of Bax targeting to mitochondria and, secondly, deficiency of Apaf-1.

Supporting this observation, point mutations that abrogate the proteolytic processing but not the catalytic activity of caspase-9, or deletion of the linker peptide, prevented caspase-9 association with XIAP and its concomitant inhibition. We note that the N-terminal four residues of caspase-9 linker peptide share significant homology with the N-terminal tetra-peptide in mature Smac and in the Drosophila proteins Hid/Grim/Reaper, defining a conserved class of IAP-binding motifs. Consistent with this finding, binding of the caspase-9 linker peptide and Smac to the BIR3 domain of XIAP is mutually exclusive, suggesting that Smac potentiates caspase-9 activity by disrupting the interaction of the linker peptide of caspase-9 with BIR3.

Expression of the CARD domain of human CLAP abrogates tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NF-κB activation, suggesting that cellular CLAP plays an essential role in this pathway of NF-κB activation.",,96,1,NIA,R01AG013487,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,8,1999-06

Mature caspase-9 is derived from its procaspase precursor as a result of recruitment by the activating factor Apaf-1. The crystal structures of the caspase-recruitment domain of Apaf-1 by itself and in complex with the prodomain of procaspase-9 have been determined at 1.6 and 2.5 A resolution, respectively. These structures and other evidence reveal that each molecule of Apaf-1 interacts with a molecule of procaspase-9 through two highly charged and complementary surfaces formed by non-conserved residues; these surfaces determine recognition specificity through networks of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. Mutation of the important interface residues in procaspase-9 or Apaf-1 prevents or reduces activation of procaspase-9 in a cell-free system. Wild-type, but not mutant, prodomains of caspase-9 completely inhibit catalytic processing of procaspase-9.

To investigate directly the apoptotic activity of these two caspases in vivo, we engineered constitutively active recombinant caspases-3 and -6 precursors.

Previously we demonstrated that the activity of a caspase that cleaves lamins is required for the disintegration of nuclei in the late stages of apoptosis, despite the presence of a second active caspase that cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). One simple explanation for this observation was that the lamin-cleaving caspase is sufficient to drive the nuclear events of apoptotic execution. Here, we report that phenylarsine oxide (PAO) inhibits the protease activities of recombinant human caspases as well as endogenous chicken caspases that are active in S/M extracts. PAO at 100 μM blocks the morphological changes of nuclear apoptosis in vitro and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in S/M extracts without interfering with PARP or lamin A cleavage. Thus, lamin cleavage is not sufficient to drive the changes in nuclear morphology characteristic of apoptosis. Affinity labeling with YV(bio)KD-aomk shows that the degree of sensitivity to PAO differs among active caspases in S/M extracts. These results suggest that a PAO-sensitive caspase that is distinct from the PARP- or lamin-cleaving enzymes is required for the initiation of apoptotic morphological changes and for the activation of endonuclease(s). Taken together, our results suggest that two or more caspases are required for proteolytic events that are essential for the initiation and completion of nuclear apoptotic changes.

Concurrently, in apoptotic cells, PARP, a 116-kilodalton (kDa) human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, is proteolytically cleaved to its signature 85-kDa fragment. The proteolytic processing of PARP (the nuclear DNA repair enzyme known to be cleaved in association with apoptosis) is catalyzed by members of the ICE/Ced-3 family. Importantly, stable transfection of the antiapoptotic baculovirus P35 inhibits glucocorticoid-induced apoptotic cell death, proteolytic processing of proCPP32, and cleavage of the 116-kDa PARP. We conclude that activation of CPP32 is a critical event in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and that this pathway is inhibited at or upstream of CPP32 by baculovirus P35. These data demonstrate that PARP cleavage occurs during glucocorticoid-induced apoptotic cell death and show that this proteolytic process is blocked by the expression of baculovirus P35, supporting a role for activation of the ICE/Ced-3-like cysteine protease during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis.",,66,0,NIAID,R01AI035035,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,2,1997-01

MR and GR, the corticosteroid receptors, share significant homology and are activated by steroid binding, resulting in a conformational change, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. Despite these similarities with GR, the MR remains less well characterized. However, protein components known to be present in the unliganded GR are also likely to be components of the heteromeric MR complex. In the current study, we investigated whether or not hsp70, hsp90, and the immunophilin FKBP-52 are present in the nonsteroid-bound MR complex, because these proteins are known to be present in the unliganded GR complex. The unliganded MR complex was assembled in vitro using reticulocyte lysate and in vivo using the baculovirus overexpression system and Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of hsp70, hsp90, and FKBP-52 in the unliganded complexes, but hsp90 and FKBP-52 were not detected following exposure to aldosterone. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that DNA binding of MR occurred only after treatment with aldosterone. These studies indicate that proteins associated with the unliganded GR are also present in the unliganded MR complex, and that hsp90 and FKBP-52 dissociate prior to DNA binding in a manner similar to that described for GR. Finally, the stoichiometric analysis of the proteins present within the heteromeric MR complex suggests a divergence between this receptor and the GR.",,39,0,NIDDK,R01DK044441,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,papers by authors,3,1997-01

Activation of CPP32 could lead to activation of other downstream ASCPs, resulting in late morphological changes such as lamin cleavage and DNA fragmentation, observed in cells undergoing apoptosis. Here we describe the identification and cloning of a novel human ASCP named Mch6 from Jurkat T lymphocytes. We demonstrate that the pro-enzymes of Mch6 and the lamin-cleaving enzyme Mch2α are substrates for mature CPP32. Site- directed mutagenesis revealed that CPP32 processes pro-Mch6 preferentially at Asp330 to generate two subunits of molecular masses 37 kDa (p37) and 10 kDa (p10). However, CPP32 processes pro-Mch2α at three aspartate processing sites (Asp23, Asp179, and Asp193) to produce the large (p18) and small (p11) subunits of the mature Mch2α enzyme. The CPP32-processed Mch2α is capable of cleaving the VEIDN lamin cleavage site, indicating that CPP32 can, in fact, activate pro-Mch2α. Granzyme B at a concentration that allows processing and activation of CPP32 failed to process pro-Mch2α. However, incubation of pro-Mch2α with granzyme B in the presence of a cellular extract containing pro-CPP32 resulted in activation of proCPP32 and subsequent processing of pro-Mch2α. Interestingly, granzyme B can also process pro-Mch6 but at a site N-terminal to that cleaved by CPP32. These data suggest that Mch2α and Mch6 are downstream proteases activated in CPP32- and granzyme B-mediated apoptosis. This is the first demonstration of a protease cascade involving granzyme B, CPP32, Mch2α, and Mch6 and evidence that the lamin-cleaving enzyme Mch2 is a target of mature CPP32.",,276,1,NIA,R01AG013487,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,5,1996-11

First, we compared the substrate specificities of two recombinant human IRPs, CPP32 and Mch2α. Both enzymes cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, albeit with different efficiencies. Mch2α also cleaved recombinant and nuclear lamin A at a conserved VEIDNG sequence located in the middle of the coiled-coil rod domain, producing a fragment that was indistinguishable from the lamin A fragment observed in S/M extracts and in apoptotic cells. In contrast, CPP32 did not cleave lamin A. The cleavage of lamin A by Mch2a and by S/M extracts was inhibited by millimolar concentrations of Zn2+, which had a minimal effect on cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase by CPP32 and by S/M extracts. We also found that n-(acetyltyrosinyrvalinyL-Nε-biotinyllysyl)aspartic acid [(2, 6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy] methyl ketone, which derivatizes the larger subunit of active ICE, can affinity label up to five active IRPs in S/M extracts.

Because of their similarity to the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death protein CED-3, the ICE-like proteins are thought to play a key role in the execution of apoptosis. The active form of ICE is a tetramer consisting of two heterodimers (p20 + p10)2 derived from the cleavage of the pro-enzyme. Results: In the present communication we show that the p51 Nedd2 precursor (pro-Nedd2) is also cleaved into p20-like (p19) and p10-like (p12) subunits by extracts prepared from cultured cell lines. Extracts from apoptotic NIH-3T3 cells but not normal growing NIH-3T3 cells also contained pro-Ncdd2 cleaving activity. The processing of pro-Nedd2 by cell extracts was inhibited by characteristic inhibitors of ICE-like proteases. Additionally we show that pro-Nedd2 (p51) can be processed in vitro by active CPP32 and ICE, and to a lesser extent by Mch2 and Nedd2. Granzyme B, a serine protease required for cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) mediated killing of target cells, also cleaved pro-Nedd2 to p19 + p12 subunits. Conclusions: Our observations suggest that Nedd2 activation requires cleavage by one or more ICE-like proteases that lie upstream in the proteolytic cascade. Cleavage of pro-Nedd2 by granzyme B indicates that Nedd2 may be one of the downstream effectors in the CTL-mediated killing of target cells. © Blackwell Science Limited.",,53,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,5,1996-01

We have shown recently that the CPP32 and Mch2α cysteine proteases cleave the apoptotic markers poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and lamins, respectively. Here we report the cloning of a new Ced-3/interleukin lβ-con verting enzyme-related gene, designated Mch3, that encodes a protein with the highest degree of homology to CPP32 compared to other family members. An alternatively spliced isoform, named Mch3β, was also identified. Bacterially expressed recombinant Mch3 has intrinsic autocatalytic/autoactivation activity. The specific activity of Mch3α toward the peptide substrate DEVD-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin and PARP resembles that of CPP32. Like interleukin lβ-con verting enzyme and CPP32, the active Mch3α is made of two subunits derived from a precursor (proMch3α). It was of interest that recombinant CPP32-pl7 subunit can form an active heteromeric enzyme complex with recombinant Mch3αpl2 subunit and vice versa, as determined by the ability of the heteromeric complexes to induce apoptosis in Sf9 cells. These data suggest that proMch3α and proCPP32 can interact to form an active Mch3α/CPP32 heteromeric complex. We also provide evidence that CPP32 can efficiently cleave proMch3α, but not the opposite, suggesting that Mch3α activation in vivo may depend in part on CPP32 activity. The high degree of conservation in structure and specific activity and the coexistence of Mch3α and CPP32 in the same cell suggests that the PARP cleavage activity observed during apoptosis cannot solely be attributed to CPP32 but could also be an activity of Mch3α. © 1995, American Association for Cancer Research.

This approach uses degenerate oligonucleotides encoding the highly conserved pentapeptides QACRG and GSWFI that are present in all known apoptotic cysteine proteases. Using this approach, we have cloned a novel apoptotic gene from human Jurkat T lymphocytes. The new gene encodes a ~34-kilodalton protein that is highly homologous to human CPP32, Caenorhabditis elegans cell death protein CED-3, mammalian Ich-1 (Nedd2), and mammalian interleukin-lβ converting enzyme. Because of its high homology to the G elegans Ced-3 gene, we named the new gene mammalian Ced-3 homologue Mch2. Two Mch2 transcripts (Mch2α, 1.7 kb; Mch2β, 1.4 kb) were detected in Jurkat T lymphocytes and other cell lines. We believe that the Mch2β transcript encodes the full-length Mch2, whereas the Mch2β transcript encodes a shorter Mch2 isoform, probably as a result of alternative splicing. Like interieukin-1β converting enzyme and CPP32, recombinant Mch2β, bat not Mch2β, possesses protease activity, as determined by its ability to cleave the fluorogenic peptide DEVD-AMC. CPP32 and Mch2α can also cleave poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in vitro, suggesting that these enzymes participate in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage observed during cellular apoptosis.

Although all the alternative splicing events were within the coding sequence of ICE, the four ICE isoforms maintained open reading frames and were designated as ICEβ, γ, δ, and ε. In ICEγ, most of the propeptide (amino acids 20-112) is deleted, which suggests that it may function as a catalyst for ICE autoprocessing in vivo. In ICEδ, amino acids 288-335, which contain the cleavage sites between the p20 and p10 subunits of ICE, are deleted thus resulting in its inactivation. Intriguingly, in ICEε amino acids 20-335, which encompass most of the propeptide and the p20 subunit, are deleted resulting in the formation of a molecule that is homologous to the p10 subunit. Examination of the ability of these four ICE isoforms to cause apoptosis revealed that only the parental ICEs and isoforms β and γ, but not isoforms δ and ε, can induce apoptosis when overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells. In addition, coexpression of the p20 and p10 but not the p20 and ICEε in Sf9 cells results in apoptosis. Interestingly, expression of ICEε and to a lesser degree ICEδ resulted in extension of the survival of baculovirus-infected cells in a manner similar to expression of BCL2. The ability of ICEε to extend the survival of Sf9 cells suggests that baculovirus-induced apoptosis in these cells is mediated by an ICE-like protease. We show that ICEε can bind to the p20 subunit of ICE and potentially may compete with the p10 subunit to form an inactive ICE complex. Therefore, by acting as a dominant inhibitor of ICE activity, ICEε may regulate ICE activation in vivo.",,142,1,NIAID,R01AI035035,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,3,1995-01

Here we describe the cloning, overexpression, and characterization of this protein from Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9 cells). The cloned cDNA codes for an acidic protein of 412 amino acids with distinct structural domains. Starting with the N terminus, the first 218 amino acids contain two highly acidic domains separated by a short basic domain. Following the second large acidic domain is another basic domain of 87 amino acids with significant sequence and structural homology to HMG1 and HMG2 DNA binding proteins. The two basic domains contain several nuclear targeting signals. The last 108 C-terminal amino acids contain a binding domain for immunosuppressive drugs FK506 and rapamycin, which makes this protein a new member of the immunophilin family. We provide evidence that the new immunophilin (FKBP46) is a DNA binding protein that can bind immunosuppressive drug FK506 and possesses peptidylprolyl isomerase activity. FKBP46 is localized in the nucleus and is associated with a nuclear kinase that specifically phosphorylates it in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. Upon subsequent sequence analysis of the mouse FKBP52 cDNA used in our previous study, it was observed that a spermatid nuclear transition protein 2 (TP2) sequence is fused in frame with the C terminus of the recombinant FKBP52 probably as a result of a cloning artifact. We demonstrate that the FKBP46 does not form a complex with the FKBP52 but rather with the highly basic nuclear protein TP2. Our data suggest that interaction of FKBP46 with TP2 is mediated by the N-terminal acidic domains of FKBP46. This implies that the acidic domains of FKBP46 are involved in protein-protein interaction between nuclear FKBP46 and other basic chromatin proteins.",,42,0,NIAID,R01AI035035,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,4,1994-12

The rFKBP-52 was highly purified on a Ni2+ affinity resin with an estimated recovery of 10 mg of pure protein from 1 liter of Sf9 cell culture. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the rFKBP-52 is expressed predominantly in the nuclei of infected Sf9 cells maximally at 48 hr after infection, consistent with the nuclear localization of FKBP-52 in mammalian cells. The rFKBP-52 can be assembled in vitro with the glucocorticoid receptor complex, establishing its functionality and confirming that it is a component of the unactivated glucocorticoid receptor complex. The rFKBP-52 possesses an ATP/GTP binding activity that is stimulated by divalent cations. Furthermore, incubation of purified rFKBP-52 with [γ-32P]ATP and MgCl2 resulted in the phosphorylation of a 59-kDa nuclear protein.

In these experiments, we estimated the survival of mice treated with a lethal dose of endotoxin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or recombinant human (rh) TNF-α (10,000 units/mouse, i.v.) together with a sublethal dose (1 mg/kg, i.p.) of endotoxin. Cepharanthine clearly protected mice from endotoxin-induced and endotoxin/rhTNF-α-induced lethal shock. In in vitro experiments, cepharanthine (3 μg/ml) definitely inhibited cell death in mouse L929 fibroblast cells incubated with rhTNF-α (100 units/ml) at 37 °C for 24 h. On the other hand, non-apoptotic programmed death of cells was observed by fluorescence microscopy in rhTNF-α (100 units/ml)-treated L929 cells. In the 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay after 48-h drug exposure, the cell proliferation of L929 cells was significantly increased by the addition of cepharanthine (1 and 3 μg/ml). It seems that the preventive effect of cepharanthine on rhTNF-α-induced cytotoxicity in fibroblast cells occurs through an increase of cell proliferation by the drug. In addition, cepharanthine suppressed nitric oxide (NO) production by endotoxin-stimulated Raw 264.7 mouse macrophage cells. These findings suggest that cepharanthine prevents lethality or cytotoxicity through suppression of endotoxin-induced NO in macrophages and that its effects are possibly mediated by the enhancement of the proliferation of fibroblast cells. Cepharanthine may therefore protect against some of the various disturbances caused by endotoxin through its ability to inhibit NO production in septic shock. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we established a culture system of stromal cells derived from murine lymph nodes and investigated the action of the stromal cells in supporting the survival of resting T cells in vitro. Most of the T cells cocultured with the stromal cells did not die, and the supernatant of cultured stromal cells increase the viability of T cells. This T-cell survival-supporting activity was maintained for more than 7 days. Although interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-7, and interferon-β also rescued peripheral T cells from spontaneous cell death, medium-soluble and heat-sensitive factor(s) derived from the stromal cells supported the survival of T cells more effectively and for a longer time than did these cytokines. T cells maintained in the culture system with the stromal cells appeared to remain in a resting G0/G1 state and did not show remarkable DNA synthesis.

Here, we found that sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) also triggers the signal for activation of Akt and downstream glycogen synthase 3β (GSK3β). Such Akt/GSK3β activation was abrogated completely by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, and greatly by pertussis toxin, a G-protein inhibitor. Arsenite-induced Akt phosphorylation also was inhibited by sequestrating membrane cholesterol with β cyclodextrin. Reducing reagents/reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers reduced arsenite-induced Akt phosphorylation and β cyclodextrin reduced arsenite-mediated ROS production, suggesting that arsenite-induced G-protein/Akt/GSK3β pathway is membrane raft dependent and redox linked. We also found that a combination of a low concentration (1 μM) of arsenite and wortmannin triggers the signal for caspase activation, whereas neither of these elements alone did so. These results suggested that selective blockade of the arsenite-provoked PI-3 kinase/Akt pathway can promote the arsenite-triggered pathway for caspase activation, and this may open a new study area for wider applications of arsenic as a drug for treating various kinds of leukemia. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.",Akt | Arsenite | Free radicals | Membrane rafts | PI-3 kinase | Reactive oxygen species,30,0,MOHW,undefined,Ministry of Health and Welfare,papers by authors,3,2003-03

In the present study, we investigated the effect of CEP on three groups of human mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in relation to CEP-induced apoptosis. CEP, at the concentration required for and at the time of induction of apoptosis, activated MAPKs p38 in both Jurkat and K562 cells and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) only in K562 cells. However, CEP treatment did not trigger c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) activation. CEP increased the expression and phosphorylation levels of c-Jun and ATF-2 transcription factors. zVAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor, did not inhibit CEP-triggered p38 activation in Jurkat and K562 cells or ERK activation in K562 cells.

We investigated the role of p38 MAP kinase activation and IκB phosphorylation in iNOS expression in a novel iNOS-inducing model in mouse macrophages. Deprivation of serum from the culture medium of RAW 264.7 cells up-regulated iNOS and NO production, which were inhibited by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a component of oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). Serum withdrawal induced phosphorylation of Akt, IκB, and p38 MAP kinase. Pretreatment with the potent P13 kinase inhibitor wortmannin, the NF-κB inhibitor PDTC or the specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 each partially attenuated the induction of iNOS and NO production, demonstrating that both p38 activation and IκB phosphorylation are required for iNOS expression. SB203580, however, did not prevent the phosphorylation of Akt and IκB, suggesting that the p38 MAP kinase signal contributes to iNOS gene expression through an IκB-phosphorylation-independent pathway. HNE, which markedly inhibited iNOS expression and NO production, prevented the serum withdrawal-triggered IκB phosphorylation but not that of Akt or p38 MAP kinase. A high concentration of HNE stimulated dephosphorylation of IκB but promoted activation of p38 MAP kinase. Taken together, these results suggest that NF-κB and p38 MAP kinase lie in separate signal pathways for serum deprivation-stimulated iNOS expression and NO production. HNE selectively suppresses the former pathway, targeting a site downstream of Akt. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",4-hydroxynonenal | Macrophage | NF-κB | Nitric oxide | P38 MAP kinase,44,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2001-10

We determined the ability of cinchonine to reverse doxorubicin drug resistance in a doxorubicin-resistant leukemia cell line (mouse P388/DOX). A non-cytotoxic concentration of cinchonine (10 μM) increased the sensitivity to doxorubicin of multidrug-resistant P388/DOX cells and significantly enhanced the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in resistant cells, but had no effect in parent cells. Time-course studies demonstrated that DNA fragmentation was present 24 h after incubation with doxorubicin and cinchonine, indicating that DNA degradation was a preceding event. In cultured cells, cinchonine increased the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in the resistant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Using flow cytometry to measure the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) dependent efflux or rhodamine 123, cinchonine was found to be considerably more effective than quinine. The results with cinchonine suggest that there may be quinine derivatives with a similar capacity to inhibit drug transport by P-gp. Additionally, the G2/M phase cell population in resistant cells is increased by doxorubicin/cinchonine treatment. Exposure of resistant cells to 1 μM doxorubicin and 10 μM cinchonine resulted in the expression of Fas (APO-1/CD95) in cells after 6 h. These studies demonstrate that the cell killing effects of doxorubicin and cinchonine in resistant cells are mediated, at least in part, by the induction of apoptosis.",,12,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2001-07

We here report that apoptosis was induced by low concentrations (1 - 5 μM) of CEP in a human leukemia T cell line, Jurkat, and by slightly higher concentrations (5 - 10 μM) in a human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562, which expresses a p210 antiapoptotic Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed in both Jurkat and K562 cells by DNA fragmentation and typical apoptotic nuclear change, which were preceded by disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and were induced through a Fas-independent pathway. CEP treatment induced activation of caspase-9 and -3 accompanied by cleavage of PARP, Bid, lamin B1, and DFF45/ICAD in both Jurkat and K562 cells, whereas caspase-8 activation and Akt cleavage were observed only in Jurkat cells. The CEP-induced apoptosis was completely blocked by zVAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor. Interestingly, CEP treatment induced remarkable degradation of the Bcr-Abl protein in K562 cells, and this degradation was prevented partially by zVAD-fmk. When used in combination with a nontoxic concentration of herbimycin A, lower concentrations (2 - 5 μM) of CEP induced obvious apoptosis in K562 cells with rapid degradation or decrease in the amount of Bcr-Abl and Akt proteins.

The effect of exposure of human keratinocytes to acrolein on cell surface-oriented signal transduction into cells was examined. Incubation of human keratinocytes with a relatively low concentration (50 μM) of acrolein caused a prompt and selective induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a 180-kDa molecule during the period from 5-30 min after the start of incubation. This early event was followed by an increase in the density and number of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins during the period from 60120 min after the start of incubation. The catalytic activity of EGFR as measured by the levels of autophorphorylation and phosphorylation of an exogenously added substrate, casein, in in vitro kinase assay, greatly increased as early as 1 min after the start of incubation and then decreased gradually 30 min later. MAP family kinases, including ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase, and the potentially downstream transcription factor c-Jun were all promoted for phosphorylation/activation during a period of 5-30 min. Selective prompt phosphorylation/activation of EGFR followed by phosphorylation of MAP family kinases and c-Jun and their blockade by a specific EGFR inhibitor, AG1478, suggested that activation of EGFR is the major, and possibly single, cell surface element for intracellular signal transduction in acrolein-treated cells. Incubation of human keratinocytes with 50 μM of acrolein induced atypical apoptosis with morphologic apoptotic features with low-grade oligonucleoside-sized DNA fragmentation. Partial inhibition of such a cytopathic effect of acrolein on human keratinocytes by preincubation with AG1478 suggests the involvement of an EGFR-mediated signal pathway for atypical apoptosis. These results provide new information on acrolein-induced cell surface-oriented signal transduction to human keratinocytes, and this information may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of a number of skin diseases in response to environmental acrolein and acrolein-generating ultraviolet irradiation. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Acrolein | Cell death | EGFR | Human keratinocyte | Signal transduction,35,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2001-05

A few percentage of RET proteins normally formed disulfide-bonded dimers in the cell, and osmotic stress promoted formation of these dimers. The disulfide-bonded dimers displayed higher levels of autophosphorylation and catalytic activity per molecule than did monomers. Osmotic stress also promoted activation and disulfide-bonded dimerization of the extracellular domain-depleted mutant RET (RET-PTC-1), suggesting that the target amino acid(s) for dimerization is located intracellularly rather than in the cysteine-rich region of the extracellular domain. In the mutant c-RET and RET-PTC-1 in which Cys987 of c-RET or Cys376 of RET-PTC-1 was replaced with Ala, the levels of intrinsic kinase activity were greatly reduced and barely increased in response to osmotic stress. Correspondingly, the Cys376-defective RET-PTC-1 did not form any demonstrable levels of dimers even after exposure to osmotic stress. In contrast, another RET-PTC-1 mutant that had a replacement of Cys365 with Ala mostly behaved like parental RET-PTC-1.

In this study, we report NaAsO2-induced signal cascades from the cell surface to the nucleus of murine thymic T lymphocytes that involve membrane rafts as an initial signal transducer. NaAsO2 induced apoptosis through fragmentation of DNA, activation of caspase, and reciprocal regulation of Bcl-2/Bax with the concomitant reduction of membrane potential. We demonstrated that NaAsO2-induced caspase activation is dependent on curcumin-sensitive c-Jun amino-terminal kinase and barely dependent on SB203580-sensitive p38 kinase or PD98059-sensitive extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Additionally, staurosporine, which severely inhibited the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) family kinases and c-Jun, partially blocked the NaAsO2-mediated signal for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) degradation. Potentially as the initial cell surface event for intracellular signaling, NaAsO2 induced aggregation of GPI-anchored protein Thy-1 and superoxide production. This Thy-1 aggregation and subsequent activation of MAP family kinase and c-Jun and the degradation of PARP induced by NaAsO2 were all inhibited by DTT, suggesting the requirement of interaction between arsenic and protein sulfhydryl groups for those effects. β cyclodextrin, which sequestrates cholesterol from the membrane rafts, inhibited NaAsO2-induced activation of protein tyrosine kinases and MAP family kinases, degradation of PARP, and production of superoxide. In addition, β cyclodextrin dispersed NaAsO2-induced Thy-1 clustering. These results suggest that a membrane raft integrity-dependent cell surface event is a prerequisite for NaAsO2-induced protein tyrosine kinase/c-Jun amino-terminal kinase activation, superoxide production, and downstream caspase activation.",,109,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,4,2000-10

We demonstrated that ultraviolet light (UV) irradiation induced activation of c-Ret and superactivation of genetically mutated, and thereby constitutively activated, Ret-MEN2A, Ret-MEN2B, and Rfp-Ret. We found that small proportions of c-Ret and Ret-MEN2B and a large proportion of MEN2A were dimerized due to disulfide bonds and that high kinase activity resided in these fractions. The UV-induced activation of c-Ret and superactivation of Ret-MEN2A and Ret-MEN2B were then shown to be closely associated with promotion of the disulfide bond-mediated dimerization of the Ret proteins. Furthermore, we showed that a large proportion of Rfp-Ret was dimerized or polymerized and that almost all kinase activities resided in the highly polymerized but not dimerized fraction. The UV-induced superactivation of Rfp-Ret was also found to be closely associated with promotion of polymerization but not with dimerization of Rfp-Ret. Further experiments revealed that UV induced intracellular dimerization and activation of the extracellular domain-deleted mutant Ret (Ret-PTC-1). Most importantly, the levels of basal kinase activity and dimerization of Ret-TPC-1-C376A, in which cysteine 376 in the tyrosine kinase domain of Ret-TPC-1 was replaced with alanine, were low and were not increased by UV irradiation. These results suggest that the cysteine at this position works as the primary target of dimerization of Ret proteins inside the cell for both the maintenance of the basal kinase activity and its promotion by UV, possibly in co-operation with the cysteine(s) in the extracellular domain of Ret-MEN2A and Rfp-Ret, which is the target of dimerization and polymerization outside the cell.

It is not clear, however, if eRF3 is targeted for the regulation of gene expression. Here we show that DNAdamaging agents (UV and etoposide) induce the immediate cleavage and degradation of eRF3 in a caspase-dependent manner. The effect is selective since the binding partners of eRF3, eRF1 and PABP, and an unrelated control, GAPDH, were not affected. Point mutations of aspartate residues within overlapping DXXD motifs near the amino terminus of eRF3 prevented the appearance of the UV-induced cleavage product, identifying D32 as the major cleavage site. The cleavage and degradation occurred in a similar time-dependent manner to those of eIF4G, a previously established caspase-3 target involved in the inhibition of translation during apoptosis. siRNA-mediated knockdown of eRF3 led to inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, supporting the idea that the decrease in the amount of eRF3 caused by the caspase-mediated degradation contributes to the inhibition of translation during apoptosis.

The DNA-dependent stimulation of ATPase activity thus rationalizes the exclusive specificity of genome-packaging motors for viral DNA in the crowd of host DNA, ensuring fidelity of packaging and avoiding wasteful ATP hydrolysis.

Two types of particles are seen: (i) empty capsids, which are not perfect icosahedral (ii) icosahedral particles filled with DNA. The gene for the 38 kDa protein is located in the SalIG fragment of the phage genome. Nucleotide sequence of the SalIG fragment of MB78 as well as its temperature sensitive mutant has been determined and analysed. Such analysis indicated that in the mutant the codon GCA has been changed to GTA resulting in substitution of alanine at position 75 of the protein by valine (A75V). This makes the protein thermolabile. Our results suggest that normal functioning of this 38 kDa protein is necessary for attachment of tail fibre to the capsid.

Furthermore stable expression of an isolated CARD of ASC in THP-1 cells diminished interleukin-1β generation in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Although the precise etiology of rosacea remains elusive, its pathogenesis is reportedly associated with an increased level of antimicrobial peptide LL-37. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of rosacea via LL-37 remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the potential role of LL-37 in rosacea-like skin inflammatory phenotypes at a molecular level. Our in vitro data demonstrated that LL-37 promotes NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation in lipopolysaccharide-primed macrophages, indicated by the processing of caspase-1 and IL-1β. LL-37 was internalized into the cytoplasm of macrophages through P2X7 receptor–mediated endocytosis. Intracellular LL-37 triggered the assembly and activation of NLRP3-ASC inflammasome complex by facilitating lysosomal destabilization. Consistent with these in vitro results, intradermal LL-37 administration induced in vivo caspase-1 activation and ASC speck formation in the skin of Nlrp3-expressing, but not in Nlrp3-deficient, mice. Intradermal injection of LL-37 elicited profound recruitment of inflammatory Gr1+ cells and subsequent skin inflammation. However, LL-37–induced rosacea-like skin inflammation was significantly abrogated in Nlrp3-deficient mice. Furthermore, an NLRP3-specific inhibitor, MCC950, markedly reduced LL-37–triggered rosacea-like phenotypes. Taken together, our findings clearly indicate that NLRP3 inflammasome activation plays a crucial role in LL-37–induced skin inflammation and rosacea pathogenesis.",,2,0,KIST,2015M3A9B6073856,Korea Institute of Science and Technology,papers by authors,4,2021-01

Brain-resident macrophages can be classified into microglia in the brain parenchyma and non-parenchymal brain macrophages, also known as central nervous system-associated or border-associated macrophages, in the brain-circulation interface. Microglia and non-parenchymal brain macrophages, including meningeal, perivascular, and choroid plexus macrophages, are mostly produced during embryonic development, and maintained their population by self-renewal. Microglia have gained much attention for their dual roles in the maintenance of brain homeostasis and the induction of neuroinflammation. In particular, diverse phenotypes of microglia have been increasingly identified under pathological conditions. Single-cell phenotypic analysis revealed that microglia are highly heterogenous and plastic, thus it is difficult to define the status of microglia as M1/M2 or resting/activated state due to complex nature of microglia. Meanwhile, physiological function of non-parenchymal brain macrophages remain to be fully demonstrated.

Its TLR4 activation was dependent on myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), leading to interferon-β (IFN-β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production. This effect was abolished by TLR4 knockdown or knockout in murine macrophages. NA6 inhibited murine norovirus (MNV) replication with an EC50 of 1.5 μM in RAW264.7 cells. It also lowered viral RNA titer in a human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh7-derived cell line harboring a human norovirus subgenomic replicon. The antiviral activity of NA6 was mainly attributed to IFN-β produced through the TLR4-TRIF signaling pathway. NA6-induced TNF-α, which had little effect on norovirus replication per se, primed macrophages to mount greater antiviral innate immune responses when IFN signaling was activated. NA6 boosted the induction of IFN-β in MNV-infected RAW264.7 cells and upregulated IFN-regulatory factor-1, an IFN-stimulated gene.

In particular, bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) were recently shown to activate host caspase-11-mediated non-canonical inflammasome pathway via deliverance of OMV-bound lipopolysaccharide. However, further precise understanding of innate immune-modulation by bacterial OMVs remains elusive. Here, we present evidence that flagellated bacteria-released OMVs can trigger NLRC4 canonical inflammasome activation via flagellin delivery to the cytoplasm of host cells. Salmonella typhimurium-derived OMVs caused a robust NLRC4-mediated caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1β secretion in macrophages in an endocytosis-dependent, but guanylate-binding protein-independent manner. Notably, OMV-associated flagellin is crucial for Salmonella OMV-induced inflammasome response. Flagellated Pseudomonas aeruginosa-released OMVs consistently promoted robust NLRC4 inflammasome activation, while non-flagellated Escherichia coli-released OMVs induced NLRC4-independent non-canonical inflammasome activation leading to NLRP3-mediated interleukin-1β secretion. Flagellin-deficient Salmonella OMVs caused a weak interleukin-1β production in a NLRP3-dependent manner. These findings indicate that Salmonella OMV triggers NLRC4 inflammasome activation via OMV-associated flagellin in addition to a mild induction of non-canonical inflammasome signaling via OMV-bound lipopolysaccharide. Intriguingly, flagellated Salmonella-derived OMVs induced more rapid inflammasome response than flagellin-deficient Salmonella OMV and non-flagellated Escherichia coli-derived OMVs. Supporting these in vitro results, Nlrc4-deficient mice showed significantly reduced interleukin-1β production after intraperitoneal challenge with Salmonella-released OMVs. Taken together, our results here propose that NLRC4 inflammasome machinery is a rapid sensor of bacterial OMV-bound flagellin as a host defense mechanism against bacterial pathogen infection.",caspase-1 | flagellin | host defense | inflammasome | interleukin-1 | NLRC4 | outer membrane vesicles,2,1,NIAS,undefined,National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences,papers by authors,4,2020-11

Emerging evidence demonstrates a critical role for inflammasome activation in vitiligo pathogenesis. However, the specific molecular mechanism of inflammasome-dependent melanocyte degeneration in vitiligo is still not clear. This study presents how extracellular ATP, released from keratinocytes by oxidative stress, affects melanocyte survival in vitiligo skin. H2O2-induced oxidative injury increased ATP release from keratinocytes and skin tissues. The high concentration of extracellular ATP induced both ROS production and cell death in melanocytes. Treatment with ATP caused the activation of caspase-1 as well as the production of active forms of IL-1β and IL-18 via P2X7 receptor in keratinocytes and melanocytes. Lesional and perilesional skin of vitiligo showed higher levels of ATP as well as upregulation of active caspase-1 compared with nonlesional skin, suggesting its possible role in inflammasome activation in vitiligo. Moreover, the elevated expression of CXCL9 in keratinocytes, mediated through ATP/P2X7 receptor–dependent inflammasome activation, was responsible for CLA+CD8+ T-cell chemotaxis into the skin. These results demonstrate that extracellular ATP as a danger signal activates the inflammasome pathway and increases cutaneous chemotaxis of CD8+ T cells via CXCL9 in vitiligo.

ZIKV infection led to increased transcript levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6 via activating NF-κB signaling.

Here, we found that perturbation of ER-Golgi trafficking by brefeldin A (BFA) treatment attenuated nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin–domain–containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in mouse bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs). BFA treatment inhibited NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly and caspase-1 activation but did not block IL-1β secretion from BMDMs following BFA administration after NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Consistently, short-hairpin RNA–dependent knockdown of BFA-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 1 (BIG1), a molecular target of BFA and an initiator of Golgi-specific vesicle trafficking, abolished NLRP3-dependent apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain oligomerization and caspase-1 activation in BMDMs. Similarly, knockdown of Golgi-specific BFA-resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1, another target of BFA, clearly attenuated NLRP3-mediated caspase-1 activation in BMDMs. Mechanistically, inhibition of BIGl-mediated vesicle trafficking did not impair NLRP3-activating signal 2-promoted events, such as potassium efflux and mitochondrial rearrangement, but caused significant impairment of signal 1-triggered priming steps, including NF-κB–mediated pathways.

Although details of the molecular mechanisms underlying dopaminergic neuronal death in PD remain unclear, neuroinflammation is also considered a potent mediator in the pathogenesis and progression of PD. In the present study, we present evidences that microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation is critical for dopaminergic neuronal loss and the subsequent motor deficits in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Specifically, NLRP3 deficiency significantly reduces motor dysfunctions and dopaminergic neurodegeneration of MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, NLRP3 deficiency abolishes MPTP-induced microglial recruitment, interleukin-1β production and caspase-1 activation in the SN of mouse brain. In primary microglia and mixed glial cell cultures, MPTP/ATP treatment promotes the robust assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome via producing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Consistently, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+) induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the presence of ATP or nigericin treatment in mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages. These findings reveal a novel priming role of neurotoxin MPTP or MPP+ for NLRP3 activation. Subsequently, NLRP3 inflammasome-active microglia induces profound neuronal death in a microglia-neuron co-culture model. Furthermore, Cx3Cr1CreER-based microglia-specific expression of an active NLRP3 mutant greatly exacerbates motor deficits and dopaminergic neuronal loss of MPTP-treated mice.

In addition to its antitumor effect, paclitaxel is also known to promote Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4-dependent inflammatory responses, which may lower its chemotherapeutic efficacy. However, it remains unclear whether paclitaxel is able to affect inflammasome signaling in myeloid or cancer cells. Therefore, we examined the potential effect of paclitaxel on the activation of an inflammasome complex by examining caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1β secretion in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The results showed that treatment with paclitaxel alone or following LPS priming failed to trigger the secretion of active caspase-1 and IL-1β from BMDMs. However, paclitaxel could induce robust activation of caspase-1 in BMDMs in the presence of NLRP3 inflammasome-activating signal 2, such as ATP or nigericin. This paclitaxel/ATP-mediated inflammasome activation was completely abrogated in Nlrp3-deficient macrophages. Mechanistically, paclitaxel treatment induced robust activation of the TLR4 signaling cascade, including phosphorylation of IκB and JNK and upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels in a TLR4-dependent manner. In contrast, paclitaxel treatment alone did not induce mitochondrial damages such as the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and production of mitochondrial ROS. These findings suggest that paclitaxel can drive the priming of signal-mediated events for NLRP3 activation but not a second signal-triggered phenomenon such as mitochondrial damage. This suggestion was supported by the observations that paclitaxel treatment caused robust IL-1β production in macrophages in the presence of cell-free medium derived from growth of injured cells and also in the spleen of mice. Collectively, our data strongly indicate that paclitaxel is able to facilitate the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in a certain physiological environment.",Caspase-1 | Chemotherapy | Inflammasome | Interleukin-1beta | NLRP3 | Paclitaxel | Toll-like receptor 4,10,1,MSIP,2015M3A9B6073856,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning",papers by authors,5,2019-01

However, the underlying mechanism by which this leaderless cytokine is secreted into the extracellular space remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that prolonged lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment to macrophages could trigger the unexpected maturation and extracellular release of IL-1β through a nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)-independent manner. Short-term treatment (less than 6 h) of LPS induced robust production of the IL-1β precursor form inside cells but did not promote the maturation and secretion of IL-1β in bone marrow-derived macrophages or peritoneal macrophages. Instead, prolonged LPS treatment (more than 12 h) led to a significant release of matured IL-1β with no robust indication of caspase-1 activation. Intriguingly, this LPS-triggered secretion of IL-1β was also observed in NLRP3-deficient macrophages. In addition, this unexpected IL-1β release was only partially impaired by a caspase-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor.

Recent studies have implicated the NLRP3 inflammasome in various psychiatric disorders, including depression. However, the underlying mechanism by which NLRP3 inflammasome activation mediates the progression of depressive-like behaviors remains poorly understood. Methods: We examined whether NLRP3 deficiency influenced depressive-like behaviors and cerebral inflammation following systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide in mice. To further assess the contribution of the NLRP3 inflammasome to the progression of depression, we evaluated the effects of NLRP3 signaling on levels of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Results: Nlrp3-deficient mice exhibited significant attenuation of depressive-like behaviors and cerebral caspase-1 activation in a lipopolysaccharide-induced model of depression. Treatment with the antidepressant amitriptyline failed to block NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1, but inhibited lipopolysaccharide-promoted production of interleukin-1β mRNA via suppressing NF-κB signaling in mouse mixed glial cultures. Interestingly, lipopolysaccharide administration produced NLRP3-dependent increases in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expression and activity of mouse brain. Furthermore, inflammasome-activating stimulations, but not treatment with the inflammasome product interleukin-1β, triggered indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase mRNA induction in mixed glial cells. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the NLRP3 inflammasome is significantly implicated in the progression of systemic inflammation-induced depression. NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation produced significant increases in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase levels, which may play a significant role in lipopolysaccharide-induced depression.

We found that BS from QS-defective ΔlasR/rhlR mutant, but not from wild-type (WT) P. aeruginosa, induces robust activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome. P. aeruginosa-released flagellin mediates this inflammasome activation by ΔlasR/rhlR secretant, but QS-regulated bacterial proteases in the WT BS impair extracellular flagellin to attenuate NLRC4 inflammasome activation. P. aeruginosa-secreted proteases also degrade inflammasome components in the extracellular space to inhibit the propagation of inflammasome-mediated responses. Furthermore, QS-regulated virulence factor pyocyanin and QS autoinducer 3-oxo-C12-homoserine lactone directly suppressed NLRC4- and even NLRP3-mediated inflammasome assembly and activation.

Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by endogenous ligands has been discovered in various disorders, including metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, gout, reperfusion injury of the heart, neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer’s disease, chronic kidney diseases, and macular degeneration of the eyes. Despite the potential significance of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of several diseases, details on the activation mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome by a variety of stimulators have yet to be reported. Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondrial events are associated with NLRP3 activation in disease conditions. Mitochondrial dysfunction acts upstream of NLRP3 activation by providing reactive oxygen species (ROS) to trigger NLRP3 oligomerization or by inducing α-tubulin acetylation to relocate mitochondria to the proximity of NLRP3. In addition, mitochondria work as a platform for inflammasome assembly. Mitochondrial events may also lie downstream of NLRP3 activation. While the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction associated with NLRP3 activation are still unclear, they may involve the perturbation of mitochondria by K+ efflux and subsequent intracellular disequilibrium.

These multi-protein complexes can be activated by exposure of cells to low osmolality. The inflammasome nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is hereby the main sensor of cellular osmolality. IL-1β was found to stimulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland either by action of prostaglandins or indirectly by causing the release of IL-6.Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the hyponatremia caused by a wide range of CNS diseases is able to induce significant cell swelling with induction of a hyposmotic intracellular environment, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, causing the release of IL-1β and induced by IL-1β, IL-6, which increases the production of ADH that leads to more profound hyponatremia. Supportive evidence for this hypothesis is the finding that IL-1 injection can induce ADH release and hyposmotic effect of ADH induced hyponatremia can, via the mechanical effect of cell swelling, activate transient receptor potential channels, which via transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 activate NLRP3. Implications of this hypothesis, if confirmed, would include that hyponatremia can be exacerbated through this vicious cycle but also that the inflammasomes are key mediators of this process. Confirmation of this hypothesis would have implications for prevention and clinical management of changes in patients sodium levels related to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) with interventions targeting inflammatory mediator production and function of inflammasomes with the potential of prevention of permanent brain damage in a wide range of CNS diseases.",,8,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2016-08

Antibiotic-treatedmice succumbed tomucosal herpes simplex virus type 2 infection more rapidly than water-fed mice, and also showed delayed viral clearance at the site of infection. However, innate immune responses, including type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine production at infection sites, as well as induction of virusspecific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in draining lymph nodes, were not impaired in antibiotic-treated mice. By screening the factors controlling antiviral immunity, we found that IL-33, an alarmin released in response to tissue damage, was secreted from vaginal epithelium after the depletion of commensal microbiota. This cytokine suppresses local antiviral immunity by blocking the migration of effector T cells to the vaginal tissue, thereby inhibiting the production of IFN-γ, a critical cytokine for antiviral defense, at local infection sites.

Here, we present evidence that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through its direct association with NLRP3. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of HDAC6 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) showed a significant increase in caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) secretion in response to NLRP3-activating stimulations, but not to absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-activating stimulation. In addition, knockdown of HDAC6 in BMDMs enhanced the oligomerization of ASC upon LPS/nigericin stimulation. The augmented NLRP3 inflammasome activation seen in HDAC6-knockdown BMDMs is independent of the deacetylase activity of HDAC6. Instead, HDAC6 directly associates with NLRP3 through its ubiquitin-binding domain. Moreover, PR619 treatment (deubiquitinase inhibitor) resulted in the elevation in the interaction of NLRP3 with HDAC6 and the decrease in NLRP3-dependent caspase-1 activation.

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family proteins such as NLRP1, NLRP3 or interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE)-protease activating factor (IPAF) have been first characterized to form inflammasome complex to induce caspase-1 activation.

Inflammasome pathways were shown to be crucial for protecting host organisms against diverse pathogen infections, but accumulating evidences also suggest that excessive activation of inflammasome/ caspase-1 might be related to the pathogenesis of inflammation-related diseases. Indeed, mutations in NLRP3 or pyrin are closely associated with autoinflammatory diseases such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) syndrome or Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), indicating that the regulation of caspase-1 activity by inflammasome is a central process in these hereditary inflammatory disorders.

Notably, FeCe6 exerted a significant suppressive effect on hydrogen peroxide-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis in Jurkat T-cells, while negligible or much weaker inhibition was observed by CHL.

Furthermore, the NO donor S-nitro-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP) inhibited ASK1 activity in vitro, and this inhibition was reversed by thiol-reducing agents such as dithiothreitol and β-mercaptoethanol. SNAP did not inhibit the kinase activities of MKK3, MKK6, or p38 in vitro. The inhibition of ASK1 by interferon-γ was not changed by 1H- (1,2,4)oxadiazolo[4,3-α ]quinoxalin-1-one, an inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase nor was it mimicked by 8-bromo-cyclic GMP. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that replacement of cysteine 869 of ASK1 by serine rendered this protein resistant to the inhibitory effects both of interferon-γ in intact cells and of SNAP in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation data showed that NO production inhibited a binding of ASK1, but not ASK1(C869S), to MKK3 or MKK6. Moreover, interferon-γ induced the S-nitrosylation of endogenous ASK1 in L929 cells. Together, these results suggest that NO mediates the interferon-γ-induced inhibition of ASK1 in L929 cells through a thiol-redox mechanism.",,92,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2004-02

However, the antioxidant property of FeCe6 has not been elucidated in detail. In this study, we investigated the ability of FeCe6 to scavenge hydroxyl radical and to protect biomolecules and mammalian cells from oxidative stress-mediated damage. In electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments, FeCe6 showed excellent hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, whereas its iron-deficient molecule, chlorin e6 (Ce6) showed little effect. FeCe6 also significantly reduced hydroxyl radical-induced thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) formation and benzoate hydroxylation in a dose-dependent manner. The rate constant for reaction between FeCe6 and hydroxyl radical was measured as 8.5 × 1010 M-1 S-1 by deoxyribose degradation method, and this value was much higher than that of most hydroxyl radical scavengers. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity of FeCe6 was also confirmed by ESR study and cytochrome c reduction assay, but its in vitro activity appeared to be less efficient in comparison with other well-known SOD mimics. In addition, FeCe6 appreciably diminished hydroxyl radical-induced DNA single-strand breakage and protein degradation in Fe-catalyzed and Cu-catalyzed Fenton systems, and it significantly protected human endothelial cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) toxicity. These results suggest that FeCe6 is a novel hydroxyl radical scavenger and may be useful for preventing oxidative injury in biological systems.",Antioxidant | Hydrogen peroxide toxicity | Hydroxyl radical scavenger | Iron chlorin e  (FeCe6) 6 | Oxidative stress,12,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2001-10

Functional enrichment analysis allows for the identification of deregulated pathways from omics scale expression data. Given the importance of post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms on protein expression and function, identification of deregulated pathways on the basis of protein expression data is likely to provide new insights. In this study, we have developed methods for label-based mass spectrometry in a large number of samples and applied these methods toward identification and quantification of protein expression in samples of infiltrating ductal carcinoma, benign breast growths, and normal adjacent tissue. We identified 265 proteins with differential expression patterns in infiltrating ductal carcinoma relative to benign growths or normal breast tissue. Analysis of the differentially expressed proteins indicated the deregulation of signaling pathways related to proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and immune response. Our approach provides complementary information to gene expression microarray data and identifies a number of deregulated molecular signaling pathways indicative of breast cancer progression that may enable more accurate, biologically relevant diagnoses and provide a stepping stone to personalized treatment. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",infiltrating ductal carcinoma | pathway analysis | quantitative label-based 2D-LC-MS/MS,3,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2012-04

Plasma biomarkers have additional value in that they can be monitored with minimal invasiveness. Plasma biomarker discovery by genome-wide proteomic methods is impeded by the wide dynamic range of protein abundance and the heterogeneity of protein expression in healthy and disease populations which requires the analysis of a large number of samples. We addressed these issues through the development of a novel protocol that couples a combinatorial peptide ligand library protein enrichment strategy with isobaric label-based 2D LC-MS/MS for the identification of candidate biomarkers in high throughput. Plasma was collected from patients with stage I breast cancer or benign breast lesions. Low abundance proteins were enriched using a bead-based combinatorial library of hexapeptides. This resulted in the identification of 397 proteins, 22% of which are novel plasma proteins. Twenty-three differentially expressed plasma proteins were identified, demonstrating the effectiveness of the described protocol and defining a set of candidate biomarkers to be validated in independent samples. This work can be used as the basis for the design of properly powered investigations of plasma protein expression for biomarker discovery in larger cohorts of patients with complex disease. © 2011.",Breast cancer | ITRAQ | Plasma,34,0,BCRF,undefined,Breast Cancer Research Foundation,papers by authors,3,2011-12

We investigated strategies to disrupt interactions among CAFs, the immune system, and cancer cells, focusing on adhesion molecule CDH11, which has been associated with other fibrotic disorders and is expressed by activated fibroblasts. Methods: We compared levels of CDH11 messenger RNA in human pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer tissues and cells with normal pancreas, and measured levels of CDH11 protein in human and mouse pancreatic lesions and normal tissues. We crossed p48-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+ (KPC) mice with CDH11-knockout mice and measured survival times of offspring. Pancreata were collected and analyzed by histology, immunohistochemistry, and (single-cell) RNA sequencing; RNA and proteins were identified by imaging mass cytometry. Some mice were given injections of PD1 antibody or gemcitabine and survival was monitored. Pancreatic cancer cells from KPC mice were subcutaneously injected into Cdh11+/+ and Cdh11–/– mice and tumor growth was monitored. Pancreatic cancer cells (mT3) from KPC mice (C57BL/6), were subcutaneously injected into Cdh11+/+ (C57BL/6J) mice and mice were given injections of antibody against CDH11, gemcitabine, or small molecule inhibitor of CDH11 (SD133) and tumor growth was monitored. Results: Levels of CDH11 messenger RNA and protein were significantly higher in CAFs than in pancreatic cancer epithelial cells, human or mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines, or immune cells. KPC/Cdh11+/– and KPC/Cdh11–/– mice survived significantly longer than KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice. Markers of stromal activation entirely surrounded pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias in KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice and incompletely in KPC/Cdh11+/– and KPC/Cdh11–/– mice, whose lesions also contained fewer FOXP3+ cells in the tumor center. Compared with pancreatic tumors in KPC/Cdh11+/+ mice, tumors of KPC/Cdh11+/– mice had increased markers of antigen processing and presentation; more lymphocytes and associated cytokines; decreased extracellular matrix components; and reductions in markers and cytokines associated with immunosuppression. Administration of the PD1 antibody did not prolong survival of KPC mice with 0, 1, or 2 alleles of Cdh11. Gemcitabine extended survival of KPC/Cdh11+/– and KPC/Cdh11–/– mice only or reduced subcutaneous tumor growth in mT3 engrafted Cdh11+/+ mice when given in combination with the CDH11 antibody. A small molecule inhibitor of CDH11 reduced growth of pre-established mT3 subcutaneous tumors only if T and B cells were present in mice. Conclusions: Knockout or inhibition of CDH11, which is expressed by CAFs in the pancreatic tumor stroma, reduces growth of pancreatic tumors, increases their response to gemcitabine, and significantly extends survival of mice. CDH11 promotes immunosuppression and extracellular matrix deposition, and might be developed as a therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.",Activated Stroma | Anti-Tumor Immunity | Desmoplasia | Immunomodulation | Inflammation,3,0,AACR,17-40-12-PERA,AstraZeneca,papers by authors,1,2021-03

The in vivo cyclin D1-mediated molecular signature predicted poor outcome of recurrence-free survival for patients with prostate cancer (K-means HR, 3.75, P - 0.02) and demonstrated that endogenous cyclin D1 restrains TGF-β Snail, Twist, and Goosecoid signaling. Endogenous cyclin D1 enhanced Wnt and ES cell gene expression and expanded a prostate stem cell population. In chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, cyclin D1 occupied genes governing stem cell expansion and induced their transcription. The coordination of EMT restraining and stem cell expanding gene expression by cyclin D1 in the prostate may contribute to its strong prognostic value for poor outcome in biochemical-free recurrence in human prostate cancer. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.",,32,1,NCI,P30CA056036,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,1,2014-01

Computational models provide the means to characterize regulatory mechanisms and predict phenotype in the context of gene networks. Integrating gene expression data with phenotypic data in transcriptional network models enables systematic identification of critical molecules in a biological network. We developed an approach based on fuzzy logic to model cell budding in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using time series expression microarray data of the cell cycle. Cell budding is a phenotype of viable cells undergoing division. Predicted interactions between gene expression and phenotype reflected known biological relationships. Dynamic simulation analysis reproduced the behavior of the yeast cell cycle and accurately identified genes and interactions which are essential for cell viability.

Several cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate, overexpress the cyclin D1 gene. However, the correlation of cyclin D1 overexpression with E2F target gene regulation or of cdk-dependent cyclin D1 activity with tumor development has not been identified. This suggests that the role of cyclin D1 in oncogenesis may be independent of its function as a cell cycle regulator. One such function is the role of cyclin D1 in cell adhesion and motility. Filamin A (FLNa), a member of the actin-binding filamin protein family, regulates signaling events involved in cell motility and invasion. FLNa has also been associated with a variety of cancers including lung cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, human bladder cancer, and neuroblastoma. We hypothesized that elevated cyclin D1 facilitates motility in the invasive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. We show that MDA-MB-231 motility is affected by disturbing cyclin D1 levels or cyclin D1-cdk4/6 kinase activity. Using mass spectrometry, we find that cyclin D1 and FLNa coimmunoprecipitate and that lower levels of cyclin D1 are associated with decreased phosphorylation of FLNa at Ser2152 and Ser1459. We also identify many proteins related to cytoskeletal function, biomolecular synthesis, organelle biogenesis, and calcium regulation whose levels of expression change concomitant with decreased cell motility induced by decreased cyclin D1 and cyclin D1-cdk4/6 activities. ©2010 AACR.",,120,0,NCI,P30CA056036,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,4,2010-03

However, the CCND1 gene encodes two gene products, cyclin D1a and cyclin D1b, which have discrete mechanisms of regulation and impact on cell behavior. A polymorphism at nucleotide 870 in the CCND1 gene, rs603965, influences the relative production of the encoded proteins and can impart increased risk for tumor development. Here, the impact of both the G/A870 polymorphism and cyclin D1b protein production on breast cancer risk, disease phenotype and patient outcome was analysed. In a large multiethnic case-control study, the G/A870 polymorphism conferred no significant risk for breast cancer overall or by stage or estrogen receptor (ER) status. However, the cyclin D1b protein was found to be upregulated in breast cancer, independent of cyclin D1a levels, and exhibited heterogeneous levels in breast cancer specimens. High cyclin D1a expression inversely correlated with the Ki67 proliferation marker and was not associated with clinical outcome. In contrast, elevated cyclin D1b expression was independently associated with adverse outcomes, including recurrence, distant metastasis and decreased survival. Interestingly, cyclin D1b was particularly associated with poor outcome in the context of ER-negative breast cancer. Thus, specific cyclin D1 isoforms are associated with discrete forms of breast cancer and high cyclin D1b protein levels hold prognostic potential. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",Breast cancer | Cyclin D1b | Estrogen receptor | Polymorphism | Prognosis,64,1,NIH,R01CA099996,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2009-04

However, it remains unknown whether loss of Cav-1 is sufficient to confer functional RB inactivation in mammary fibroblasts. To establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, mammary stromal fibroblasts (MSFs) were prepared from Cav-1-/- null mice and subjected to phenotypic analysis. Here, we provide evidence that Cav-1-/- MSFs share many characteristics with human cancer-associated fibroblasts. The Cav-1-/- MSF transcriptome significantly overlaps with human cancer-associated fibroblasts; both show a nearly identical profile of RB/E2F-regulated genes that are up-regulated, which is consistent with RB inactivation. This Cav-1-/- MSF gene signature is predictive of poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. Consistent with these findings, Cav-1-/- MSFs show RB hyperphosphorylation and the up-regulation of estrogen receptor co-activator genes. We also evaluated the paracrine effects of ""conditioned media"" prepared from Cav-1 -/- MSFs on wild-type mammary epithelia. Our results indicate that Cav-1-/- MSF ""conditioned media"" is sufficient to induce an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, indicative of an invasive phenotype. Proteomic analysis of this ""conditioned media"" reveals increased levels of proliferative/angiogenic growth factors. Consistent with these findings, Cav-1-/- MSFs are able to undergo endothelial-like transdifferentiation. Thus, these results have important implications for understanding the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts and RB inactivation in promoting tumor angiogenesis.

Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), a muscle-specific caveolin-related gene, is highly expressed in muscle cells. We demonstrate that Cav-3 is also expressed in myoepithelial cells within the mammary gland. To determine whether genetic ablation of Cav-3 expression affects adult mammary gland development, we studied the phenotype(s) of Cav-3-/--null mice. Interestingly, Cav-3 -/- virgin mammary glands developed lobuloalveolar hyperplasia, akin to the changes normally observed during pregnancy and lactation. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed up-regulation of gene transcripts associated with pregnancy/lactation, mammary stem cells, and human breast cancers, consistent with a constitutive lactogenic phenotype. Expression levels of three key transcriptional regulators of lactation, namely Elf5, Stat5a, and c-Myc, were also significantly elevated. Experiments with pregnant mice directly showed that Cav-3-/- mice underwent precocious lactation. Finally, using orthotopic tumor cell implantation, we demonstrated that virgin Cav-3 -/- mice were dramatically protected against mammary tumor formation. Thus, Cav-3-/- mice are a novel preclinical model to study the protective effects of a lactogenic microenvironment on mammary tumor onset and progression. Our current studies have broad implications for using the lactogenic microenvironment as a paradigm to discover new therapies for the prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers.

The androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-regulated modular nuclear receptor governing prostate cancer cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in response to androgens, including dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Here, SIRT1 antagonists induce endogenous AR expression and enhance DHT-mediated AR expression. SIRT1 binds and deacetylates the AR at a conserved lysine motif. Human SIRT1 (hSIRT1) repression of DHT-indeced AR signaling requires the NAD-dependent catalytic function of hSIRT1 and the AR lysine residues deacetylated by SIRT1. SIRT1 inhibited coactivator-induced interactions between the AR amino and carboxyl termini. DHT-induced prostate cancer cellular contact-independent growth is also blocked by SIRT1, providing a direct functional link between the AR, which is a critical determinant of progression of human prostate cancer, and the sirtuins.

We therefore investigated the mechanisms by which p27Kip1 inhibits mammary tumor onset Using the common background strain of FVB, p27Kip1 heterozygosity (p27+/-)accelerated ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis. We conducted microarray analyses of mammary tumors developing in mice with genetic haploinsufficiency for p27Kip1 expressing a mammary-targeted ErbB2 oncogene. Global gene expression profiling and Western blot analysis of ErbB2/p27+/- tumors showed that the loss of p27 Kip1 induced genes promoting lymphangiogenesis, cellular proliferation, and collaborative oncogenic signaling (Wnt/β-catenin/Tcf, Cdc25a, Smad7, and Skp2). Skp2 expression was induced by ErbB2 and repressed by p27Kip1. Degradation of p27Kip1 involves an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, including Skp2. The Skp2 component of the SCFSKP2 complex that degrades p27Kip1 was increased in ErbB2 tumors correlating with earlier tumor onset. In both murine and human ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancers, p27Kip1 levels correlated inversely with Skp2. p27Kip1 haploinsufficiency activated Wnt/β-catenin/hedgehog signaling. Reintroduction of p27Kip1 inhibited β-catenin induction of Tcf-responsive genes (Siamosis, c-Myc, and Smad7). p27Kip1 is haploinsufficient for ErbB2 mammary tumor suppression in vivo and functions to repress collaborative oncogenic signals including Skp2 and Wnt/β-catenin signalling. ©2006 American Association for Cancer Research.",,32,1,NIA,R03AG020337,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,3,2006-09

An open question is whether such posttranslational changes act redundantly or dependently upon one another. We show that a functional interference between specific acetylated and phosphorylated residues of p53 influences cell fate. Acetylation of lysine 320 (K320) prevents phosphorylation of crucial serines in the NH2- terminal region of p53; only allows activation of genes containing high-affinity p53 binding sites, such as p21/WAF; and promotes cell survival after DNA damage. In contrast, acetylation of K373 leads to hyperphosphorylation of p53 NH2-terminal residues and enhances the interaction with promoters for which p53 possesses low DNA binding affinity, such as those contained in proapoptotic genes, leading to cell death. Further, acetylation of each of these two lysine clusters differentially regulates the interaction of p53 with coactivators and corepressors and produces distinct gene-expression profiles. By analogy with the ""histone code"" hypothesis, we propose that the multiple biological activities of p53 are orchestrated and deciphered by different ""p53 cassettes,"" each containing combination patterns of posttranslational modifications and protein-protein interactions. © The Rockefeller University Press.",,201,0,NCI,R01CA030716,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,8,2006-05

SIRT1, the closest mammalian ortholog of the yeast SIR2 (silent information regulator 2) gene, represses several transcription factors, including p53, NFκB and forkhead proteins. The p300 protein serves as a rate-limiting transcriptional cointegrator of diverse transcription factors either to activate or to repress transcription through modular subdomains. Herein, SIRT1 physically interacted with and repressed p300 transactivation, requiring the NAD-dependent deacetylase activity of SIRT1. SIRT1 repression involved the CRD1 transcriptional repression domain of p300. Two residues within the CRD1 domain (Lys-1020 and Lys-1024) were required for SIRT1 repression and served as substrates for SIRT1 deacetylation. These residues also serve as acceptor lysines for modification by the ubiquitin-like SUMO protein. The SUMO-specific protease SSP3 relieved SIRT1 repression of p300. SSP3 antagonism of SIRT1 required the SUMO-deconjugating function of SSP3. Thus, p300 serves as a deacetylase substrate for SIRT1 through a conserved SUMO consensus motif. Because p300 is a limiting transcriptional cofactor, deacetylation and repression of p300 by SIRT1 may serve an important integration point during metabolism and cellular differentiation. © 2005 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,264,1,NCI,P30CA051008,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,4,2005-03

Gene network models are needed to interpret the resulting large and complex data sets. Rationally designed perturbations (e.g., gene knock-outs) can be used to iteratively refine hypothetical models, suggesting an approach for high-throughput biological system analysis. We introduce an approach to gene network modeling based on a scalable linear variant of fuzzy logic: a framework with greater resolution than Boolean logic models, but which, while still semiquantitative, does not require the precise parameter measurement needed for chemical kinetics-based modeling. Results: We demonstrated our approach with exhaustive search for fuzzy gene interaction models that best fit transcription measurements by microarray of twelve selected genes regulating the yeast cell cycle. Applying an efficient, universally applicable data normalization and fuzzification scheme, the search converged to a small number of models that individually predict experimental data within an error tolerance.Because only gene transcription levels are used to develop the models, they include both direct and indirect regulation of genes. Conclusion: Biological relationships in the best-fitting fuzzy gene network models successfully recover direct and indirect interactions predicted from previous knowledge to result in transcriptional correlation. Fuzzy models fit on one yeast cell cycle data set robustly predict another experimental data set for the same system. Linear fuzzy gene networks and exhaustive rule search are the first steps towards a framework for an integrated modeling and experiment approach to high-throughput ""reverse engineering"" of complex biological systems. © 2004 Sokhansanj et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,35,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,6,2004-08

Biosignatures have analogous properties. A biosignature can be associated with a particular attribute of a pathogen or a host. However, the signature may be lost in backgrounds of similar or even identical signals from other sources. In this paper, we highlight statistical and signal processing challenges associated with identifying good biosignatures for pathogens in host and other environments. In some cases, it may be possible to identify useful signatures of pathogens through indirect but amplified signals from the host. Discovery of these signatures requires new approaches to modeling and data interpretation. Finally, an understanding of pathways (or gene networks) that are modified through host-pathogen interactions will result in better detectors as well as opportunities in vaccines and therapeutics. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of The Frankin Institute.",Fuzzy logic | Gene expression | Genetic algorithm | Modeling | Signature,1,0,LLNL,undefined,Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,papers by authors,7,2004-01

A series of structural transitions were observed in Ti/Al multilayered thin films on reducing the layer thickness of the Ti and Al layers. An hcp-fcc transition was found to occur in the Ti layers on reduction of the layer thickness to 5 nm. Al too exhibited an fcc-hcp transition on reducing the layer thickness to 2.5 nm. Interestingly, at thicknesses less than or equal to 2.5 nm Ti reverted to the hcp structure. An attempt was made to explain these transformations in the stacking sequence of the Ti and Al layers using two models, one based on the influence of discontinuities at the interface on the stacking fault energies (Redfield and Zangwill), and the other on the role of interfacial energies on the total free energy of the superlattice structure. The application of the first of these has been described elsewhere, but here initial results obtained from the second are described. The model makes first principles electronic structure calculations to determine the effect of bulk, interfacial and thin film strain energies on the structural stability of the multilayers. Initial results suggest that strain energy may be playing a pivotal role in determining the structure.

The crystal lattice is found to lower the plasmon frequency of Al for large wave vectors by as much as 4 eV. For this metal, agreement with experiment is excellent in the time-dependent local-density approximation for exchange correlation.

The former method is based on both perturbative and nonperturbative evaluations of the total energy of the crystal. In the perturbative approach the total energy is evaluated to second order in the electron-ion interaction with a local pseudopotential. In the nonperturbative approach the electron-ion interaction is treated exactly using a nonlocal ab initio pseudopotential. In the empirical force-constant method the total energy is represented by a sum of two-body and three-body terms, the latter being restricted to interactions among triplets of nearest neighbors and of nearest and next-nearest neighbors. All models include physical mechanisms for ensuring the breakdown of the Cauchy relation. We show that in each method convergence of the calculated phonon frequencies requires the inclusion of long-range interactions. The radial-force constants obtained by the empirical and perturbative pseudopotential methods are very similar for the first three shells of neighbors. On the other hand, the tangential force constants differ markedly, a reflection of the different physical mechanisms that come into play in the various models in the establishment of equilibrium. © 1993 The American Physical Society.",,24,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,4,1993-01

BTK directly interacts with NLRP3 in immune cells and phosphorylates four conserved tyrosine residues upon inflammasome activation, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, BTK promotes NLRP3 relocalization, oligomerization, ASC polymerization, and full inflammasome assembly, probably by charge neutralization, upon modification of a polybasic linker known to direct NLRP3 Golgi association and inflammasome nucleation. As NLRP3 tyrosine modification by BTK also positively regulates IL-1β release, we propose BTK as a multifunctional positive regulator of NLRP3 regulation and BTK phosphorylation of NLRP3 as a novel and therapeutically tractable step in the control of inflammation.",,0,0,DRCRF,390873048,Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation,papers by authors,2,2021-09

First, RNA-sequence analysis suggests paired-helical filaments (PHFs) from human tauopathy brain primes nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), chemokine, and IL-1β signaling clusters in human primary microglia. Treating microglia with pTau-containing neuronal media, exosomes, or PHFs causes IL-1β activation, which is NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 dependent. Suppression of pTau or ASC reduces tau pathology and inflammasome activation in rTg4510 and hTau mice, respectively. Although the deletion of MyD88 prevents both IL-1β expression and activation in the hTau mouse model of tauopathy, ASC deficiency in myeloid cells reduces pTau-induced IL-1β activation and improves cognitive function in hTau mice. Finally, pTau burden co-exists with elevated IL-1β and ASC in autopsy brains of human tauopathies.

However, the expression pattern of circulating extracellular vesicle (EV)-incorporated lncRNAs in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is still poorly investigated. A human lncRNA array revealed that certain EV-lncRNAs are significantly dysregulated in CAD patients. Circulating small EVs (sEVs) from patients with (n = 30) or without (n = 30) CAD were used to quantify PUNISHER (also known as AGAP2-antisense RNA 1 [AS1]), GAS5, MALAT1, and H19 RNA levels. PUNISHER (p = 0.002) and GAS5 (p = 0.02) were significantly increased in patients with CAD, compared to non-CAD patients. Fluorescent labeling and quantitative real-time PCR of sEVs demonstrated that functional PUNISHER was transported into the recipient cells. Mechanistically, the RNA-binding protein, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK), interacts with PUNISHER, regulating its loading into sEVs. Knockdown of PUNISHER abrogated the EV-mediated effects on endothelial cell (EC) migration, proliferation, tube formation, and sprouting. Angiogenesis-related gene profiling showed that the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) RNA was significantly increased in EV recipient cells. Protein stability and RNA immunoprecipitation indicated that the PUNISHER-hnRNPK axis regulates the stability and binding of VEGFA mRNA to hnRNPK. Loss of PUNISHER in EVs abolished the EV-mediated promotion of VEGFA gene and protein expression.

Therefore, this study explored the therapeutic effects of a novel and selective NLRP3 antagonist in a murine dietary model of NASH. Methods: Groups of 12-week-old ApoE-/- mice were fed ad lib for 7 weeks with a methionine/choline deficient (MCD) and western diet (WD). After 3 weeks of diet-induced injury, mice were injected i. p. with the NLRP3 antagonist IFM-514 (100 mg/kg body weight) or vehicle (0.5% carmellose) every day, 5 days/week for a further 4 weeks. Several markers of inflammation, fibrosis and steatosis were evaluated. Whole transcriptome sequencing and panel RNA expression analysis (NanoString) were performed. Results: IFM-514 inhibited IL-1β production in mice challenged with 20 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide, and in mouse and human inflammatory cells in vitro. IFM-514 inhibited hepatic inflammation in the in vivo non-alcoholic steatohepatitis model assessed by H&E staining and in the hepatic gene expression of inflammasome-related proinflammatory cytokines. This effect was associated with significant reduction in caspase-1 activation. Similarly, IFM-514 was efficacious in vivo in MDC-fed ApoE-/- mice, markedly reducing portal pressure, Sirius red staining and 4-hydroxyproline content compared to vehicle-treated mice. Moreover, IFM-514 significantly reduced hepatic steatosis in MCD-fed ApoE-/- mice, as evidenced by NAFLD scores, oil red O staining, hepatic triglycerides and gene expression. In WD treated animals, similar trends in inflammation and fibrosis were observed, although not sufficient IFM-514 levels were reached. Conclusion: Overall, IFM-514 reduced liver inflammation and fibrosis, with mild effects on liver steatosis in experimental murine NASH.

These mechanisms evolved to curb the spread of microbes and to induce repair of the damaged tissue. Chronic activation of inflammasomes, however, contributes to non-resolving inflammatory responses that lead to immuno-pathologies. Inflammasome-activated cells undergo an inflammatory cell death associated with the release of potent pro-inflammatory cytokines and poorly characterized extracellular vesicles (EVs). Since inflammasome-induced EVs could signal inflammasome pathway activation in patients with chronic inflammation and modulate bystander cell activation, we performed a systems analysis of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) content and function of two EV classes. We show that EVs released from inflammasome-activated macrophages carry a specific RNA signature and contain interferon β (IFNβ). EV-associated IFNβ induces an interferon signature in bystander cells and results in dampening of NLRP3 inflammasome responses. EVs could, therefore, serve as biomarkers for inflammasome activation and act to prevent systemic hyper-inflammatory states by restricting NLRP3 activation in bystander cells.",cell communication | extracellular vesicle | inflammasome | inflammation | interferon β | nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-containing protein with a pyrin domain (NLRP3) | pyroptosis,0,1,NHMRC,1083596,National Health and Medical Research Council,papers by authors,3,2021-08

Methods: A high content screen with 41,184 small molecules was performed using fluorescent Apoptosis associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation as a readout for inflammasome activation. Hit compounds were validated for inhibition of interleukin (IL)-1β secretion. Of these, the approved thiuramdisulfide derivative disulfiram was selected and tested in a patch test model of irritant contact dermatitis in 25 healthy volunteers. Topical application of disulfiram, mometasone or vehicle was followed by application of sodiumdodecylsulfate (SDS) for 24 h each. Eczema induction was quantified by mexameter and laser speckle imaging. Corneocyte sampling of lesional skin was performed to assess inflammasome-mediated cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Results: Disulfiram induced a dose-dependent inhibition of ASC speck formation and IL-1β release in cellular assays in vitro. In vivo, treatment with disulfiram, but not with vehicle and less mometasone, inhibited SDS-induced eczema. This was demonstrated by significantly lower erythema and total perfusion values assessed by mexameter and laser speckle imaging for disulfiram compared to vehicle (p < 0.001) and/or mometasone (p < 0.001). Also, corneocyte IL-18 levels were significantly reduced after application of disulfiram compared to vehicle (p < 0.001).

Objectives: To identify patients with ARDS characterized by IL-1β and IL-18 expression and investigate the ability of tetracycline to inhibit inflammasome-caspase-1 signaling in ARDS. Methods: IL-1β and IL-18 concentrations were quantified in BAL fluid from patients with ARDS. Tetracycline's effects on lung injury and inflammation were assessed in two mouse models of direct (pulmonary) acute lung injury, and its effects on IL-1β and IL-18 production were assessed by alveolar leukocytes from patients with direct ARDS ex vivo. Murine macrophages were used to further characterize the effect of tetracycline on the inflammasome-caspase-1 pathway. Measurements and Main Results: BAL fluid concentrations of IL-1β and IL-18 are significantly higher in patients with direct ARDS than those with indirect (nonpulmonary) ARDS. In experimental acute lung injury, tetracycline significantly diminished lung injury and pulmonary inflammation by selectively inhibiting caspase-1-dependent IL-1β and IL-18 production, leading to improved survival. Tetracycline also reduced the production of IL-1b and IL-18 by alveolar leukocytes from patients with direct ARDS. Conclusions: Tetracycline may be effective in the treatment of direct ARDS in patients with elevated caspase-1 activity.",Antibacterial agents | Immunomodulation | Inflammasomes | Influenza | Precision medicine,3,0,Uni Bonn,undefined,B.

Current studies propose that canonical binding of dsDNA by cGAS depends on DNA length, but not on base sequence. In contrast, activation of TLR9 is sequence dependent. It requires unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in microbial DNA, which is mimicked by synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Here, we provide evidence that d-type ODN (D-ODN), but not K-type ODN (K-ODN), bind to human cGAS and activate downstream signaling. Transfection of D-ODN into a TLR9-deficient, human monocytic cell line (THP-1) induced phosphorylation of IRF3 and secretion of IFN. This response was absent in cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cGAS- or STING-deficiency. Utilizing a protein pulldown approach, we further demonstrate direct binding of D-ODN to cGAS. Induction of a type I IFN response by D-ODN was confirmed in human primary monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages. These results are relevant to our understanding of self–nonself-discrimination by cGAS and to the pharmacologic effects of ODN, which currently are investigated in clinical studies.",cGAMP | cGAS | CpG-oligonucleotide | immunotherapy | innate immunity | interferons | pattern recognition receptors | STING | toll-like receptor 9 | type I interferon,1,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2021-07

To test this hypothesis, we investigated three AD candidate markers (ferritin, fatty acid binding protein 3 (FABP-3), and neurogranin) in interrelation to established AD and inflammatory protein markers. We further aimed to determine if such interrelations would be evident in pathological subjects only or also under non-pathological circumstances. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of the three proteins were quantified in samples from the University Clinic of Bonn (UKB) Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases & Geriatric Psychiatry, Germany. Data were analyzed based on clinical or biomarker-defined stratification of subjects with adjustment for covariates age, sex, and APOE status. Levels of ferritin, FABP-3 and neurogranin were elevated in subjects with pathological levels of t-tau independent of beta-amyloid status. The three markers correlated with each other, tau isoforms, age, and those inflammatory markers previously described as related to neurodegeneration, predominantly sTREM2, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), and C1q. These interrelations existed in subjects with pathological and sub-pathological tau levels, in particular for FABP-3 and neurogranin. Relations to ferritin were independent of absolute levels of tau, too, but showed differing trajectories between pathological and non-pathological subjects. A specific set of inflammatory markers is highly related to markers of neuronal damage such as tau, neurogranin, or FABP-3. These proteins could be used as readouts of the inflammatory response during the neurodegeneration phase of AD.

Here, we first interrogated plaque crystal structure and composition in atherosclerotic SIV-infected macaques using non-linear optical microscopy. By stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation approaches both amorphous and crystalline plaque lipid was detected and the crystal spectral profile indicated a cholesterol ester (CE) dominated composition. Versus controls, SIV+ samples had a greater number of cholesterol crystals (CCs), with the difference, in part, accounted for by crystals of a smaller length. Given the ester finding, we profiled HIV+ plaques and also observed a CE crystalline spectral signature. We further profiled plaques from Ldlr-/- mice fed a high fat diet, and likewise, found CE-dominate crystals. Finally, macrophage exposure to CCs or AcLDL induced auto-fluorescent puncta that costained with the LC3B autophagy sensor. In aggregate, we show that atheromatous plaques from mice, macaques and humans, display necrotic cores dominated by esterified CCs, and that plaque macrophages may induce autophagic vesicle formation upon encountering CCs.

As shown for primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), the mechanisms and circuits between different cell death pathways leading to disease progression are incompletely defined. Common bile duct ligation (BDL) is a well-established murine model to mimic cholestatic liver injury. Here, we hypothesized that pyroptotic cell death by the Nucleotide-Binding Domain, Leucine-Rich-Containing Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing-3 (Nlrp3) inflammasome plays an essential role during human and murine cholestasis. Approach and Results: NLRP3 activation was analyzed in humans with cholestatic liver injury. Wild-type (WT) and Nlrp3−/− mice were subjected to BDL for 2 or 28 days. Chronic cholestasis in humans and mice is associated with NLRP3 activation and correlates with disease activity. Acute BDL in Nlrp3-deficient mice triggered increased inflammation as well as liver injury, associated with stronger apoptotic and necroptotic cell death. In contrast, NLRP3 deletion led to decreased liver injury and inflammation in chronic cholestasis. Moreover, bridging fibrosis was observed in WT, but not in NLRP3 knockout, mice 28 days after BDL. In contrast, lack of NLRP3 expression attenuated kidney injury and fibrosis after acute and chronic BDL. Importantly, administration of MCC950, an NLRP3 small molecule inhibitor, reduced BDL-induced disease progression in WT mice. Conclusions: NLRP3 activation correlates with disease activity in patients with PBC. NLRP3 has a differential role during acute and chronic cholestatic liver injury in contrast to kidney injury. Disease progression during chronic cholestasis can be targeted through small molecules and thus suggests a potential clinical benefit for humans, attenuating liver and kidney injury.",,4,1,DFG,BO3755/6-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,papers by authors,3,2021-05

Hence, the inflammasome has gained enormous momentum in biomedical basic research. The detailed mechanisms of inflammasome generation and regulation remain to be elucidated. Our study was directed toward the design, convergent synthesis, and initial biochemical evaluation of activity-based probes addressing NLRP3. For this purpose, probes were assembled from a CRID3/MCC950-related NLRP3-binding unit, a linker portion and a coumarin 343 fluorophore or biotin. The affinity of our probes to NLRP3 was demonstrated through SPR measurements and their cellular activity was confirmed by reduction of the interleukin 1β release from stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages. The initial characterizations of NLRP3-targeting probes highlighted the coumarin probe 2 as a suitable tool compound for the cellular and biochemical analysis of the NLRP3 inflammasome.",CRID3 | inflammasome | MCC950 | NLRP3 | probes | surface plasmon resonance,0,1,DFG,EXC2151 – 390873048,Jürgen Manchot Stiftung,papers by authors,4,2021-04

Despite being inert in human cells, UA in its soluble form (sUA) can increase the level of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in murine macrophages. We, therefore, hypothesized that the recognition of sUA is achieved by the Naip1-Nlrp3 inflammasome platform. Through structural modelling predictions and transcriptome and functional analyses, we found that murine Naip1 expression in human macrophages induces IL-1β expression, fatty acid production and an inflammation-related response upon sUA stimulation, a process reversed by the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Nlrp3. Moreover, molecular interaction experiments showed that Naip1 directly recognizes sUA. Accordingly, Naip may be the sUA receptor lost through the human evolutionary process, and a better understanding of its recognition may lead to novel anti-hyperuricaemia therapies.",,0,1,FAPESP,2014/06992-8,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,papers by authors,2,2021-02

In a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) analysis of an Indian cohort, we found evidence for both TLR4-399T and TRL8-1A conveying increased susceptibility towards tuberculosis (TB) in an interdependent manner, even though there is no established TLR4 ligand present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which is the causative pathogen of TB. Docking studies revealed that TLR4 and TLR8 can build a heterodimer, allowing interaction with TLR8 ligands. The conformational change of TLR4-399T might impair this interaction. With immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we precipitated TLR4 with TLR8-targeted antibodies, indicating heterodimerisation. Confocal microscopy confirmed a high co-localisation frequency of TLR4 and TLR8 that further increased upon TLR8 stimulation. The heterodimerisation of TLR4 and TLR8 led to an induction of IL12p40, NF-κB, and IRF3. TLR4-399T in interaction with TLR8 induced an increased NF-κB response as compared to TLR4-399C, which was potentially caused by an alteration of subsequent immunological pathways involving type I IFNs. In summary, we present evidence that the heterodimerisation of TLR4 and TLR8 at the endosome is involved in Mtb recognition via TLR8 ligands, such as microbial RNA, which induces a Th1 response.

Treatment with BA lowers circulating lipid levels and reduces systemic inflammation, suggesting a dual benefit of this drug for atherosclerosis therapy. Recent studies have shown that targeting Acly in macrophages can attenuate inflammatory responses and decrease atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability. Therefore, it could be beneficial to extend the application of Acly inhibition from solely lipid-lowering by liver-specific inhibition to also targeting macrophages in atherosclerosis.

analyses of the innate immune system, including the earliest time points, are essential to understand the immunopathogenesis and clinical course of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Here, we performed a detailed characterization of natural killer (NK) cells in 205 patients (403 samples; days 2 to 41 after symptom onset) from four independent cohorts using single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics together with functional studies. We found elevated interferon (IFN)-α plasma levels in early severe COVD-19 alongside increased NK cell expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and genes involved in IFN-α signaling, while upregulation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced genes was observed in moderate diseases. NK cells exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) activity but are functionally impaired in severe COVID-19. Further, NK cell dysfunction may be relevant for the development of fibrotic lung disease in severe COVID-19, as NK cells exhibited impaired anti-fibrotic activity. Our study indicates preferential IFN-α and TNF responses in severe and moderate COVID-19, respectively, and associates a prolonged IFN-α-induced NK cell response with poorer disease outcome.",antiviral | COVID-19 | lung fibrosis | moderate | NK cells | proteomics | scRNA-seq | severe | TNF | type 1 IFN,0,0,DZIF,322568668,Eli Lilly and Company,papers by authors,2,2021-01

But how does ubiquitin, a 76 amino acid peptide, carry out such diverse, complex functions in eukaryotic cells? Part of the answer is rooted in the high degree of complexity associated with ubiquitin polymers, which can be ‘read’ and processed differently depending on topology and cellular context. However, recent evidence indicates that post-translational modifications on ubiquitin itself enhance the complexity of the ubiquitin code. Here, we review recent discoveries related to the regulation of the ubiquitin code by phosphorylation. We summarize what is currently known about phosphorylation of ubiquitin at Ser65, Ser57, and Thr12, and we discuss the potential for phosphoregulation of ubiquitin at other sites. We also discuss accumulating evidence that ubiquitin-like modifiers, such as SUMO, are likewise regulated by phosphorylation. A complete understanding of these regulatory codes and their complex lexicon will require dissection of mechanisms that govern phosphorylation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins, particularly in the context of cellular stress and disease.",mitophagy | phosphorylation | protein degradation | proteostasis | signaling | stress responses | ubiquitin,0,1,NIH,R01 GM118491,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2021-01

Although the link between intestinal dysbiosis and chronic liver disease is well-established, there is little evidence for a functional role of gut-liver interaction during ALF. Here we hypothesized that intestinal dysbiosis may affect ALF. Methods: To test this hypothesis, we assessed the association of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or long-term antibiotics (ABx) intake, which have both been linked to intestinal dysbiosis, and occurrence of ALF in the 500,000 participants of the UK BioBank population-based cohort. For functional studies, male Nlrp6-/- mice were used as a dysbiotic mouse model and injected with a sublethal dose of acetaminophen (APAP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce ALF. Results: Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed a significantly increased risk (odds ratio, 2.3–3) for developing ALF in UK BioBank participants with PPI or ABx. Similarly, dysbiotic Nlrp6-/- mice displayed exacerbated APAP- and LPS-induced liver injury, which was linked to significantly reduced gut and liver tissue microbiota diversity and correlated with increased intestinal permeability at baseline. Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) from Nlrp6-/- mice into wild-type (WT) mice augmented liver injury on APAP treatment in recipient WT mice, resembling the inflammatory phenotype of Nlrp6-/- mice. Specifically, FMT skewed monocyte polarization in WT mice toward a Ly6Chi inflammatory phenotype, suggesting a critical function of these cells as sensors of gut-derived signals orchestrating the inflammatory response. Conclusions: Our data show an important yet unknown function of intestinal microbiota during ALF. Intestinal dysbiosis was transferrable to healthy WT mice via FMT and aggravated liver injury. Our study highlights intestinal microbiota as a targetable risk factor for ALF.",Acute Liver Failure | Dysbiosis | Gut-Liver-Axis | Microbiota,6,1,DFG,691438,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,papers by authors,8,2021-01

While monocytes and NOD-like receptor family-pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) are associated with T1D onset and development, the specific receptors and factors involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation remain unknown. Herein, we evaluated the inflammatory state of resident peritoneal macrophages (PMs) from genetically modified non-obese diabetic (NOD), NLRP3-KO, wild-type (WT) mice and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from human T1D patients. We also assessed the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the inflammatory status. Macrophages from STZ-induced T1D mice exhibited increased inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels, nitric oxide (NO) secretion, NLRP3 and iNOS protein levels, and augmented glycolytic activity compared to control animals. In PMs from NOD and STZ-induced T1D mice, DHA reduced NO production and attenuated the inflammatory state. Furthermore, iNOS and IL-1β protein expression levels and NO production were lower in the PMs from diabetic NLRP3-KO mice than from WT mice. We also observed increased IL-1β secretion in PBMCs from T1D patients and immortalized murine macrophages treated with advanced glycation end products and palmitic acid. The present study demonstrated that the resident PMs are in a proinflammatory state characterized by increased NLRP3/iNOS pathway-mediated NO production, up-regulated proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine receptor expression and altered glycolytic activity. Notably, ex vivo treatment with DHA reverted the diabetes-induced changes and attenuated the macrophage inflammatory state. It is plausible that DHA supplementation could be employed as adjuvant therapy for treating individuals with T1D.",,1,1,FAPESP,161731/2012-0,Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation,papers by authors,9,2021-01

Their neurotoxicity is described best but they inflict damage to various cell types by an uncertain pathomechanism. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts and an alkyne analog of 1-deoxysphinganine (doxSA), the metabolic precursor of all deoxySLs, we here study the impact of deoxySLs on macroautophagy/autophagy, the regulated degradation of dysfunctional or expendable cellular components. We find that deoxySLs induce autophagosome and lysosome accumulation indicative of an increase in autophagic flux. The autophagosomal machinery targets damaged mitochondria that have accumulated N-acylated doxSA metabolites, presumably deoxyceramide and deoxydihydroceramide, and show aberrant swelling and tubule formation. Autophagosomes and lysosomes also interact with cellular lipid aggregates and crystals that occur upon cellular uptake and N-acylation of monomeric doxSA. As crystals entering the lysophagosomal apparatus in phagocytes are known to trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome, we also treated macrophages with doxSA. We demonstrate the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by doxSLs, prompting the release of IL1B from primary macrophages. Taken together, our data establish an impact of doxSLs on autophagy and link doxSL pathophysiology to inflammation and the innate immune system.

Although TLR protein expression in monocytes and tissue macrophages is thought to be optimized for microenvironments in each tissue, a comprehensive study has not been reported. We here examined protein expression of endogenous TLRs in tissue-resident myeloid cells. Neutrophils in peripheral blood, spleen, liver and lung expressed TLR2, TLR4 and TLR5 in all tissues. Ly6C+ MHC II‒ classical monocytes mature into Ly6C‒ MHC II+ monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) or Ly6C‒ MHC II‒ patrolling monocytes. These subsets were found in all the tissues studied. TLR2 and TLR4 were displayed on all of these subsets, regardless of location. In contrast, expression of endosomal TLRs did vary with tissues and subsets. moDCs expressed TLR9, but much less TLR7. In contrast, TLR7, not TLR3 or TLR9, was highly expressed in classical and patrolling monocytes. Tissue macrophages such as red pulp macrophages in the spleen, Kupffer cells in the liver, microglia in the brain, alveolar macrophages in the lung and adipose tissue macrophages all expressed TLR2, TLR4 and TLR3. TLR7 was also expressed in these tissue macrophages except Kupffer cells in the liver. TLR9 expression in tissue macrophages was much lower or hard to detect.

We investigated the relationship between CC, complement and NLRP3 in patients with cardiovascular disease. Methods: We analysed plasma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and carotid plaques from patients with advanced atherosclerosis applying ELISAs, multiplex cytokine assay, qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and gene profiling. Findings: Transcripts of interleukin (IL)-1beta(β) and NLRP3 were increased and correlated in PBMC from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Priming of these cells with complement factor 5a (C5a) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) before incubation with CC resulted in increased IL-1β protein when compared to healthy controls. As opposed to healthy controls, systemic complement was significantly increased in patients with stable angina pectoris or ACS. In carotid plaques, complement C1q and C5b-9 complex accumulated around CC-clefts, and complement receptors C5aR1, C5aR2 and C3aR1 were higher in carotid plaques compared to control arteries. Priming human carotid plaques with C5a followed by CC incubation resulted in pronounced release of IL-1β, IL-18 and IL-1α. Additionally, mRNA profiling demonstrated that C5a and TNF priming followed by CC incubation upregulated plaque expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components. Interpretation: We demonstrate that CC are important local- and systemic complement activators, and we reveal that the interaction between CC and complement could exert its effect by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, thus promoting the progression of atherosclerosis.",Atherosclerosis | Carotid atherosclerosis | Cholesterol crystals | Complement system | Coronary artery disease | Inflammation | NLRP3 inflammasome,7,1,,50052400,Norges Forskningsråd,papers by authors,1,2020-10

We conducted metabolomic profiling of sera collected from Ldlr−/− mice on either regular chow diet (CD) or HFD, and after an additional low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. HFD feeding, as well as LPS treatment, elicited pronounced metabolic changes. HFD qualitatively altered the systemic metabolic response to LPS; particularly, serum concentrations of fatty acids and their metabolites varied between LPS-challenged mice on HFD or CD, respectively. To investigate whether systemic metabolic changes were sustained long-term, mice fed HFD were shifted back to CD after four weeks (HFD > CD). When shifted back to CD, serum metabolites returned to baseline levels, and so did the response to LPS. Our results imply that systemic metabolism rapidly adapts to dietary changes.

We monitored newly synthesized proteins across different host cell compartments and infection stages. Within this rich resource, we detected aberrant trafficking of lysosomal proteases to the extracellular space and the nucleus. We verified that active cathepsins re-traffic to the nucleus and that these are linked to cell death. Pharmacological cathepsin inhibition and nuclear targeting of a cellular cathepsin inhibitor (stefin B) suppressed S. enterica Typhimurium-induced cell death. We demonstrate that cathepsin activity is required for pyroptotic cell death via the non-canonical inflammasome, and that lipopolysaccharide transfection into the host cytoplasm is sufficient to trigger active cathepsin accumulation in the host nucleus and cathepsin-dependent cell death. Finally, cathepsin inhibition reduced gasdermin D expression, thus revealing an unexpected role for cathepsin activity in non-canonical inflammasome regulation.

Here, we report an age-dependent vulnerability of wild-type (WT) mice of either sex toward a systemic immune stimulation by Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Decreased neuronal complexity three months after peripheral immune stimulation is accompanied by impairment in long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning. Aged APP/PS1 mice reveal an increased sensitivity also to LPS of Escherichia coli, which had no effect in WT mice. We further report that these effects are mediated by NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, since the genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition using the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 rescue the morphological and electrophysiological phenotype.",APP/PS1 | Hippocampus | LPS | Neuroinflammation | NLRP3 | Sepsis,7,1,JPND,SFB854,EU Joint Programme – Neurodegenerative Disease Research,papers by authors,8,2020-07

While these symptoms arise acutely during the course of infection, less is known about the possible long-term consequences for the brain. Severely affected COVID-19 cases experience high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and acute respiratory dysfunction and often require assisted ventilation. All these factors have been suggested to cause cognitive decline. Pathogenetically, this may result from direct negative effects of the immune reaction, acceleration or aggravation of pre-existing cognitive deficits, or de novo induction of a neurodegenerative disease. This article summarizes the current understanding of neurological symptoms of COVID-19 and hypothesizes that affected patients may be at higher risk of developing cognitive decline after overcoming the primary COVID-19 infection. A structured prospective evaluation should analyze the likelihood, time course, and severity of cognitive impairment following the COVID-19 pandemic.",Cognition | Cytokine | Decline | Neurodegeneration | Neuroinflammation | NLRP3 inflammasome | Systemic inflammation,109,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2020-06

To explore the protective nature of this variant, we employed latent process linear mixed models to examine the association of p.P522R with longitudinal cognitive decline in 3595 MCI patients, and in 10,097 individuals from population-based studies. Furthermore, association with CSF levels of pTau181, total tau, and Aβ1-42 was assessed in 1261 MCI patients. We found that MCI patients who carried the p.P522R variant showed a slower rate of cognitive decline compared to non-carriers and that this effect was mediated by lower pTau181 levels in CSF. The effect size of the association of p.P522R with the cognitive decline and pTau181 was similar to that of APOE-ε4, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. Interestingly, the protective effect of p.P522R was more pronounced in MCI patients with low Aβ1-42 levels suggesting a role of PLCG2 in the response to amyloid pathology. In line with this hypothesis, we observed no protective effect of the PLCG2 variant on the cognitive decline in population-based studies probably due to the lower prevalence of amyloid positivity in these samples compared to MCI patients. Concerning the potential biological underpinnings, we identified a network of co-expressed proteins connecting PLCG2 to APOE and TREM2 using unsupervised co-regulatory network analysis. The network was highly enriched for the complement cascade and genes differentially expressed in disease-associated microglia. Our data show that p.P522R in PLCG2 reduces AD disease progression by mitigating tau pathology in the presence of amyloid pathology and, as a consequence, maintains cognitive function. Targeting the enzyme PLCG2 might provide a new therapeutic approach for treating AD.",Alzheimer’s disease | Cognitive decline | Mild cognitive impairment | Phospholipase C gamma 2 | PLCG2,9,1,NIH,115372,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2020-06

This study aimed to verify findings in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects from the network of the European, Innovative Medicines Initiative–funded project AETIONOMY. Methods: A total of 227 samples from the studies/centres AETIONOMY, ICEBERG, and IDIBAPS were used to analyse 21 selected immunity biomarkers in CSF. Results were compared to data of an independent cohort of 399 subjects previously published. Results: Immunity markers were predominantly and reproducibly associated with pathological levels of tau isoforms, but also with amyloid levels, aging, sex, APOE genotype, and center-specific factors. Discussion: Immunity biomarker levels in CSF reflect molecular and cellular pathology rather than diagnosis in neurodegenerative disorders.

Little is known about the packaging of miRs into EVs. Previous studies have shown that certain miRs are exported by RNA-binding proteins into small EVs, while for other miRs and for large EVs, in general, the export mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, a proteomic analysis of endothelial cell-derived large EVs was performed, which revealed that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU) is abundantly present in EVs. EVs were characterized by electron microscopy, immunoblotting and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Taqman microRNA array and single qPCR experiments identified specific miR patterns to be exported into EVs in an hnRNPU-dependent way. The specific role of hnRNPU for vesicular miR-sorting was confirmed independently by gain- and loss-of-function experiments. In our study, miR-30c-5p was the miR whose export was most significantly regulated by hnRNPU. Mechanistically, in silico binding analysis showed that the export of miRs into EVs depends on the binding efficiency of the respective miRs to hnRNPU. Among the exported miRs, a significant enrichment of the sequence motif AAMRUGCU was detected as a potential sorting signal. Experimentally, binding of miR-30c-5p to hnRNPU was confirmed independently by RNA-immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and reciprocally by miR-pulldown. Nuclear binding of miR-30c-5p to hnRNPU and subsequent stabilization was associated with a lower cytoplasmatic abundance and consequently reduced availability for vesicular export. hnRNPU-dependent miR-30c-5p export reduced cellular migration as well as pro-angiogenic gene expression in EV-recipient cells. In summary, hnRNPU retains miR-30c-5p and other miRs and thereby prevents their export into large EVs.

Identification of endogenous inflammasome activators is essential for the development of new anti-inflammatory treatment strategies. Here, we identified that apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC3) activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in human monocytes by inducing an alternative NLRP3 inflammasome via caspase-8 and dimerization of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Alternative inflammasome activation in human monocytes is mediated by the Toll-like receptor adapter protein SCIMP. This triggers Lyn/Syk-dependent calcium entry and the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to activation of caspase-8. In humanized mouse models, ApoC3 activated human monocytes in vivo to impede endothelial regeneration and promote kidney injury in an NLRP3- and caspase-8-dependent manner. These data provide new insights into the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the pathophysiological role of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins containing ApoC3.

Whether concurrent changes in the cellular metabolism that occur upon TLR activation influence the quality of the transcriptional responses remains unknown. Here, we investigated how macrophages adopt their metabolism early after activation to regulate TLR-inducible gene induction. Shortly after TLR4 activation, macrophages increased glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle volume. Metabolic tracing studies revealed that TLR signaling redirected metabolic fluxes to generate acetyl-Coenzyme A (CoA) from glucose resulting in augmented histone acetylation. Signaling through the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF resulted in activation of ATP-citrate lyase, which in turn facilitated the induction of distinct LPS-inducible gene sets. We postulate that metabolic licensing of histone acetylation provides another layer of control that serves to fine-tune transcriptional responses downstream of TLR activation.

The onset and progression of these diseases are linked with the inflammatory response, especially NLRP3 inflammasome activation, inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Because high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) have shown significant antiatherogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, we evaluated their immunomodulatory activity in response to cholesterol crystals and other innate immune activators. Human primary monocyte-derived macrophages, THP-1 cells, and murine macrophages were stimulated to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and other pattern recognition receptors, in the presence or absence of HDL. Then, HDL immunomodulatory effects were evaluated through IL-1β and IL-6 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Furthermore, in vivo HDL anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a murine model of peritoneal inflammatory infiltration. HDLs have an immunomodulatory effect on different cellular models, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, THP-1 cells, and murine macrophages, by affecting the activity of innate immunity sensors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), dectin-1, and inflammasomes. HDL reduces the proinflammatory role of cholesterol crystals, nigericin, and other NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome agonists, and several TLR agonists, leading to a decreased production of IL-1β and IL-6. The results suggest that HDLs are highly important in the regulation of the innate immune response and may have a beneficial role in controlling diseases associated with the inflammatory response.",cholesterol crystals | high-density lipoproteins | inflammasome | interleukin-1β | Toll-like receptors,10,0,DFG,4000000147-18,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,papers by authors,3,2019-12

Herein we investigated the distinct role of the IL1R1 ligands interleukin (IL) -1α and IL-1β and focused on the mechanism of IL-1β production. IL-1α and IL-1β deficient mice were protected from POI. Bone-marrow transplantation studies indicated that IL-1α originated from radio-resistant cells while IL-1β was released from the radio-sensitive infiltrating leukocytes. Mouse strains deficient in inflammasome formation identified the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome to be crucial for IL-1β production in POI. Mechanistically, antibiotic-treated mice revealed a prominent role of the microbiome in IL-1β production. Our study provides new insights into distinct roles of IL-1α and IL-1β signalling during POI.

However, the mechanisms by which CD82 participates in innate immunity are unknown. We report that CD82 is a key regulator of TLR9 trafficking and signaling. TLR9 recognizes unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs present in viral, bacterial, and fungal DNA. We demonstrate that TLR9 and CD82 associate in macrophages, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and post-ER. Moreover, CD82 is essential for TLR9-dependent myddosome formation in response to CpG stimulation. Finally, CD82 modulates TLR9-dependent NF-αB nuclear translocation, which is critical for inflammatory cytokine production. To our knowledge, this is the first time a tetraspanin has been implicated as a key regulator of TLR signaling.

Once activated, microglia show changes in their morphology, characterized by a retraction of cell processes. Systemic inflammation is known to increase the risk for cognitive decline in human neurogenerative diseases including Alzheimer's. Here, we assess for the first time microglial changes upon a peripheral immune challenge in the context of aging and Alzheimer's in vivo, using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. Microglia were monitored at 2 and 10 days post-challenge by lipopolysaccharide. Microglia exhibited a reduction in the number of branches and the area covered at 2 days, a phenomenon that resolved at 10 days. Systemic inflammation reduced microglial clearance of amyloid-beta in APP/PS1 mice. NLRP3 inflammasome knockout blocked many of the observed microglial changes upon lipopolysaccharide, including alterations in microglial morphology and amyloid pathology.

Inflammatory cascades in both tissues are triggered by the uptake of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) or islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregates by microglial cells (AD) or macrophages (T2D) and their insufficient lysosomal degradation. This results in lysosomal damage, caspase-1/NLRP3 inflammasome activation and release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), a key proinflammatory cytokine in both diseases. Here we show that the inflammatory processes mediated by Aβ and IAPP aggregates in microglial cells and macrophages are blocked by IAPP-GI, a nonamyloidogenic IAPP mimic, which forms high-affinity soluble and nonfibrillar hetero-oligomers with both polypeptides. In contrast to fibrillar Aβ aggregates, nonfibrillar Aβ/IAPP-GI or Aβ/IAPP hetero-oligomers become rapidly internalized by microglial cells and targeted to lysosomes where Aβ is fully degraded. Internalization occurs via IAPP receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, in contrast to IAPP aggregates, IAPP/IAPP-GI hetero-oligomers become rapidly internalized and degraded in the lysosomal compartments of macrophages. Our findings uncover a previously unknown function for the IAPP/Aβ cross-amyloid interaction and suggest that conversion of Aβ or IAPP into lysosome-targeted and easily degradable hetero-oligomers by heteroassociation with IAPP mimics could become a promising approach to specifically prevent amyloid-mediated inflammation in AD, T2D, or both diseases.",Alzheimer's disease | amyloid inhibitor | inflammasome activation | Islet amyloid polypeptide | type 2 diabetes | β-amyloid peptide,9,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,11,2019-08

Such a small change in tail length did not alter the physical properties such as size distribution, zeta potential and polydispersity index (PDI). The NLRP3 activation potency of K3C16 was shown to be 1.5-fold higher. Yet, the toxicity was minimal, whereas K3C14 has shown to cause significant cell death after 24 h incubation. Even in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors, cytochalasin D or dynasore, K3C16 continued to activate the NLRP3 inflammasomes and to induce IL-1β release.

We tested selective NLRP3 inhibitors (IFM-514, IFM-632, and CRID3) for their efficacy in human and murine RPE cells. Inflammasome activation was induced in primary human RPE cells and ARPE-19 cells following priming with IL-1α by different stimuli, including lysosomal membrane permeabilization by leucyl-leucine methyl ester (Leu-Leu-OMe), oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide, lipofuscin-mediated photooxidative damage induced by incubation with 4-hydroxynonenal-modified photoreceptor outer segments and subsequent blue light irradiation, and P2X7 receptor activation by benzoylbenzoyl-ATP. Independent of the applied activation mechanism, treatment with the NLRP3 inhibitors IFM-632, IFM-514, and CRID3 resulted in a significant suppression of inflammasome activation as assessed by IL-1β and LDH release. Likewise, inflammasome activation in blue light-irradiated Abca4−/− mouse and Leu-Leu-OMe-treated wild-type mouse RPE/choroid/sclera eye cups was significantly reduced by treatment with the NLRP3 inhibitors. These results indicate that the investigated selective NLRP3 inhibitors are effective in human and murine RPE cells, thus representing promising agents for the future evaluation of inflammasome inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in atrophic AMD. Key messages: • NLRP3 inhibitors suppress inflammasome activation in human RPE cells independent of trigger. • Light-induced inflammasome activation in Abca4−/− mouse eye cups is reduced by NLRP3 inhibitors. • Novel selective NLRP3 inhibitors are effective in human and murine RPE cells. • Promising compounds for pharmaceutical intervention in atrophic AMD.",Age-related macular degeneration | Interleukin-1 | Lysosomal membrane permeabilization | Oxidative damage | P2X7 receptor,5,0,ERC,KR 2863/7-2,European Research Council,papers by authors,14,2019-04

The NLRP3 inflammasome mediates inflammation in several chronic diseases by processing the cytokines pro-interleukin (IL)-1β and pro-IL-18. In this study, we investigated whether MCC950, a recently-identified inhibitor of NLRP3 activity, reduces blood pressure (BP), renal inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction in mice with established hypertension. Methods and results C57BL6/J mice were made hypertensive by uninephrectomy and treatment with deoxycorticosterone acetate (2.4 mg/day, s.c.) and 0.9% NaCl in the drinking water (1K/DOCA/salt). Normotensive controls were uninephrectomized and received normal drinking water. Ten days later, mice were treated with MCC950 (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or vehicle (saline, s.c.) for up to 25 days. BP was monitored by tail-cuff or radiotelemetry; renal function by biochemical analysis of 24-h urine collections; and kidney inflammation/pathology was assessed by real-time PCR for inflammatory gene expression, flow cytometry for leucocyte influx, and Picrosirius red histology for collagen. Over the 10 days post-surgery, 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice became hypertensive, developed impaired renal function, and displayed elevated renal levels of inflammatory markers, collagen and immune cells. MCC950 treatment from day 10 attenuated 1K/DOCA/salt-induced increases in renal expression of inflammasome subunits (NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1) and inflammatory/injury markers (pro-IL-18, pro-IL-1β, IL-17A, TNF-α, osteopontin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, CCL2, vimentin), each by 25-40%. MCC950 reduced interstitial collagen and accumulation of certain leucocyte subsets in kidneys of 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice, including CD206 + (M2-like) macrophages and interferon-gamma-producing T cells. Finally, MCC950 partially reversed 1K/DOCA/salt-induced elevations in BP, urine output, osmolality, [Na + ], and albuminuria (each by 20-25%). None of the above parameters were altered by MCC950 in normotensive mice. Conclusion MCC950 was effective at reducing BP and limiting renal inflammation, fibrosis and dysfunction in mice with established hypertension.

Chemical inhibition and small interfering RNA knockdown of NLRP3 in primary human macrophages abrogated their IL-1b response to CLCs. Using C57BL/6 ASC-mCitrine transgenic inflammasome reporter mice, we showed that the instillation of CLCs into the lungs promoted the assembly of ASC complexes in infiltrating immune cells (neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes) and resulted in IL-1b accumulation into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

Herein, we questioned whether the NLRP3 inflammasome-activating cationic liposomes could promote antigen presentation and be applied as an immune adjuvant. In addition, we aimed to investigate the structure effect of lipid on triggering these immune responses. Materials and methods: A series of structurally similar lipids, consisting of arginine (Arg) head group and varied lengths of alkyl chains or spacers in between were used to prepare cationic liposomes. Lipopolysaccharide-primed human or murine macrophages or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-primed THP-1 cells were treated with these liposomes, and interleukin (IL)-1β secretion was measured to quantify the NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Lysosome rupture was examined in THP-1 cells by the fluorescence loss of acridine orange, a lysosome dye. Further, chicken ovalbumin (OVA) was loaded on the liposome surface and applied to murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs), which activate OT-I and OT-II lymphocytes upon major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-and class II-mediated antigen presentation, respectively. OT-I and OT-II cell division and IL-2 secretion were measured to evaluate the antigen presentation efficiency. The expressions of MHC molecules and co-stimulatory molecules ie, CD80, CD86, and CD40 on BMDCs were investigated by flow cytometry. Results: All the liposomes showed size distributions of 80–200 nm and zeta potentials of around 50 mV. A3C14 liposomes, consisting of Arg-C3-Glu2C14 lipids induced the most potent lysosome rupture and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. OVA-A3C14 also exhibited the most potent MHC class I-and class II-mediated antigen presentation in BMDCs without interfering MHC and co-stimulatory molecules. Conclusion: The hydrophobic moieties of arginine-based liposomes are crucial in stimulating innate immune cells. A3C14 liposomes were non-immunogenic but strongly activated innate immune cells and promoted antigen presentation, and therefore can be applied as immune adjuvants.",Antigen presentation | Arginine | Cationic liposomes | Lysosome rupture | NLRP3 inflammasome activation,7,1,ERC,GRK1923,European Research Council,papers by authors,18,2019-01

But systemic inflammation can also be found in the absence of a confirmed infection. Detection of bacterial DNA has been investigated as a marker of SBP and as a predictor of prognosis. Data is, however, contradictory. Here we investigated whether levels of IL-6 and IL-8 putatively produced by myeloid cells in ascites are associated with systemic inflammation and whether inflammation depends on the presence of specific bacterial DNA. Methods and Materials: We enrolled 33 patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis from whom we collected paired samples of blood and ascites. IL-6 and IL-8 were measured in serum samples of all patients using ELISA. In a subset of 10 representative patients, bacterial DNA was extracted from ascites and whole blood, followed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Results: There were significantly higher levels of IL-6 in ascites fluid compared to blood samples in all patients. Interestingly, IL-6 levels in blood correlated tightly with disease severity and surrogates of systemic inflammation, while IL-6 levels in ascites did not. Moreover, patients with higher blood CRP levels showed greater SBP prevalence compared to patients with lower levels, despite similar positive culture results. Bacterial richness was also significantly higher in ascites compared to the corresponding patient blood. We identified differences in microbial composition and diversity between ascites and blood, but no tight relationship with surrogates of systemic inflammation could be observed. Discussion: In decompensated cirrhosis, markers of systemic inflammation and microbiota composition seem to be dysregulated in ascites and blood. While a relationship between systemic inflammation and microbiota composition seems to exist in blood, this is not the case for ascites in our hands. These data may suggest compartmentalization of the immune response and interaction of the latter with the microbiota especially in the blood compartment.",Acute-on-chronic liver failure | Ascites | Cirrhosis | Cytokines | Microbiome | Myeloid cells | Systemic inflammation,16,1,H2020,668031,Pfizer,papers by authors,1,2019-01

In Western societies the age-related inflammatory response can additionally be aggravated by an inflammatory response related to modern lifestyles and excess calorie consumption, a pathophysiologic inflammatory response that was coined metaflammation. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of mechanisms that drive both of these processes and focus our discussion the emerging concept that a key innate immune pathway, the NLRP3 inflammasome, is centrally involved in the recognition of triggers that appear during physiological aging and during metabolic stress. We further discuss how these processes are involved in the pathogenesis of common age-related pathologies and highlight potential strategies by which the detrimental inflammatory responses could be pharmacologically addressed.",Aging | Inflammaging | Metaflammation | NLRP3 inflammasome | Proinflammatory cytokines,59,0,NIH,1R01HL112661,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2018-12

Upon TLR activation, the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domains of TLR dimers initiate oligomerization of a multiprotein signaling platform comprising myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and members of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family. Formation of this myddosome complex initiates signal transduction pathways, leading to the activation of transcription factors and the production of inflammatory cytokines. To date, little is known about the assembly and disassembly of the myddosome and about the mechanisms by which these complexes mediate multiple downstream signaling pathways. Here, we isolated myddosome complexes from whole-cell lysates of TLR-activated primary mouse macrophages and from IRAK reporter macrophages to examine the kinetics of myddosome assembly and disassembly. Using a selective inhibitor of IRAK4's kinase activity, we found that whereas TLR cytokine responses were ablated, myddosome formation was stabilized in the absence of IRAK4's kinase activity. Of note, IRAK4 inhibition had only a minimal effect on NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. In summary, our results indicate that IRAK4 has a critical scaffold function in myddosome formation and that its kinase activity is dispensable for myddosome assembly and activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways but is essential for MyD88-dependent production of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest that the scaffold function of IRAK4 may be an attractive target for treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",,37,1,NIH,R01AR066808,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2018-09

Fetuin-A stabilizes saturated mineral solutions by forming colloidal protein-mineral complexes called calciprotein particles (CPP). CPP are initially spherical, amorphous and soft, and are referred to as primary CPP. These particles spontaneously convert into secondary CPP, which are larger, oblongate, more crystalline, and less soluble. CPP mediate excess mineral transport and clearance from circulation. Methods: We studied by intravital two-photon microscopy the clearance of primary vs. secondary CPP by injecting i.v. synthetic fluorescent CPP in mice. We analyzed CPP organ distribution and identified CPP endocytosing cells by immunofluorescence. Cellular clearance was studied using bone marrow-derived mouse wildtype and scavenger receptor A (SRA)-deficient macrophages, as well as human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVEC), monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM), and human aortic endothelial cells (haEC). We employed mouse wildtype and mutant immortalized macrophages to analyze CPP-induced inflammasome activation and cytokine secretion. Results: In live mice, only primary CPP were rapidly cleared by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC), whereas primary and secondary CPP were cleared by Kupffer cells. Scavenger receptor A (SRA)-deficient bone marrow macrophages endocytosed secondary CPP less well than did wildtype macrophages. In contrast, primary CPP endocytosis did not depend on the presence of SRA, suggesting involvement of an alternative clearance pathway. CPP triggered TLR4 dependent TNFa and IL-1β secretion in cultured macrophages. Calcium content-matched primary CPP caused twice more IL-1β secretion than did secondary CPP, which was associated with increased calcium-dependent inflammasome activation, suggesting that intracellular CPP dissolution and calcium overload may cause this inflammation. Conclusions: Secondary CPP are endocytosed by macrophages in liver and spleen via SRA. In contrast, our results suggest that primary CPP are cleared by LSEC via an alternative pathway. CPP induced TLR4-dependent TNFa and inflammasome-dependent IL-1β secretion in macrophages suggesting that inflammation and calcification may be considered consequences of prolonged CPP presence and clearance.",Calcification | Calciprotein particle | Fetuin-A | Inflammation | Phosphate | Plasma protein,37,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,4,2018-09

We previously reported that NLRP3 inflammasome KO mice, when bred into APPswe/ PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice, are completely protected from amyloid-induced AD-like disease, presumably because they cannot produce mature IL1β or IL18. To test the role of IL18, we bred IL18KO mice with APP/PS1 mice. Surprisingly, IL18KO/APP/PS1 mice developed a lethal seizure disorder that was completely reversed by the anticonvulsant levetiracetam. IL18-deficient AD mice showed a lower threshold in chemically induced seizures and a selective increase in gene expression related to increased neuronal activity. IL18-deficient AD mice exhibited increased excitatory synaptic proteins, spine density, and basal excitatory synaptic transmission that contributed to seizure activity.

Furthermore, treatment with Atezolizumab, a fully humanised monoclonal antibody against PD-L1, in 4 patients with lung cancer caused a decrease in PD-L1 expression in platelets, which was restored over 20 days.

We have shown that cellular uptake of dental calculus triggers nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, leading to the processing of the interleukin-1β precursor into its mature form in mouse and human phagocytes. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome also induced a lytic form of programmed cell death, pyroptosis, in these cells. However, the effects of dental calculus on other cell types in periodontal tissue have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine whether dental calculus can induce cell death in oral epithelial cells. Material and Methods: HSC-2 human oral squamous carcinoma cells, HOMK107 human primary oral epithelial cells and immortalized mouse macrophages were exposed to dental calculus or 1 of its components, hydroxyapatite crystals. For inhibition assays, the cells were exposed to dental calculus in the presence or absence of cytochalasin D (endocytosis inhibitor), z-YVAD-fmk (caspase-1 inhibitor) or glyburide (NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor). Cytotoxicity was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and staining with propidium iodide. Tumor necrosis factor-α production was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Oral epithelial barrier function was examined by permeability assay. Results: Dental calculus induced cell death in HSC-2 cells, as judged by LDH release and propidium iodide staining. Dental calculus also induced LDH release from HOMK107 cells. Following heat treatment, dental calculus lost its capacity to induce tumor necrosis factor-α in mouse macrophages, but could induce LDH release in HSC-2 cells, indicating a major role of inorganic components in cell death. Hydroxyapatite crystals also induced cell death in both HSC-2 and HOMK107 cells, as judged by LDH release, indicating the capacity of crystal particles to induce cell death. Cell death induced by dental calculus was significantly inhibited by cytochalasin D, z-YVAD-fmk and glyburide, indicating NLRP3 inflammasome involvement. In permeability assays, dental calculus attenuated the barrier function of HSC-2 cell monolayers. Conclusion: Dental calculus induces pyroptotic cell death in human oral epithelial cells and the crystalline structure plays a major role in this process.

UNC93B1 is thought to guide NA-sensing TLRs from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to their respective endosomal signaling compartments and to guide the flagellin receptor TLR5 to the cell surface, raising the question of how UNC93B1 mediates differential TLR trafficking. Here, we report that UNC93B1 regulates a step upstream of the differential TLR trafficking process. We discovered that UNC93B1 deficiency resulted in near-complete loss of TLR3 and TLR7 proteins in primary splenic mouse dendritic cells and macrophages, showing that UNC93B1 is critical for maintaining TLR expression. Notably, expression of an ER-retained UNC93B1 version was sufficient to stabilize TLRs and largely restore endosomal TLR trafficking and activity. These data are critical for an understanding of how UNC93B1 can regulate the function of a broad subset of TLRs. UNC93B1 is known as a trafficking chaperone for both endosomal TLRs and cell-surface TLR5, but how UNC93B1 transports its client TLRs to different compartments remains to be determined. Pelka and colleagues show that, in fact, UNC93B1 functions upstream of differential trafficking pathways and is crucial for stabilizing UNC93B1-dependent TLRs.",nucleic acid sensing | TLR | TLR trafficking | TLR13 | TLR3 | TLR7 | TLR8 | TLR9 | Toll-like receptors | UNC93B | UNC93B1,43,1,NIH,10049A-G9,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,14,2018-05

Suppressive oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing repetitive TTAGGG motifs present in mammalian telomeres have proven useful in the treatment of autoimmune diseases including SLE. In this study, we demonstrate that the suppressive ODN A151 effectively inhibits activation of cGAS in response to cytosolic DNA, thereby inhibiting type I IFN production by human monocytes. In addition, A151 abrogated cGAS activation in response to endogenous accumulation of DNA using TREX1-deficient monocytes. We demonstrate that A151 prevents cGAS activation in a manner that is competitive with DNA. This suppressive activity of A151 was dependent on both telomeric sequence and phosphorothioate backbone. To our knowledge this report presents the first cGAS inhibitor capable of blocking self-DNA.

Liver and spleen stiffness might predict clinically significant portal hypertension. This prospective study investigated liver stiffness in patients receiving TIPS regardless of indication. Of 83 included patients, 16 underwent transient elastography immediately before and 30 minutes after TIPS (acute group), while 67 received shear wave elastography of liver and spleen 1 day before and 7 days after TIPS (chronic group) and were followed further. In blood samples obtained before TIPS from cubital, portal, and hepatic veins, levels of several interleukins (IL1b, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL18) and interferon-gamma were analyzed. In 27 patients (5 acute, 22 chronic), it resulted in an increase in liver stiffness of >10%. In 56 patients, liver stiffness decreased or remained unchanged (<10%). Importantly, spleen stiffness measured by shear wave elastography decreased in all patients (chronic group). None of the clinical or laboratory parameters differed between patients with increase in liver stiffness and those without. Of note, patients with increased liver stiffness showed higher overall and/or hepatic venous levels of proinflammatory cytokines at TIPS and higher incidence of organ failure and worse survival after TIPS. C-reactive protein values and increase of >10% in liver stiffness after TIPS were the only independent predictors of mortality in these patients. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the presence of systemic inflammation predisposes patients to develop increased liver stiffness after TIPS, a predictor of organ failure and death.

Within the last years they have gained an increased attention as cell-recognition tools. Here, we report a systematic analysis of a cell-SELEX procedure, for the identification of aptamers that recognise breast cancer cells. Besides a comparison of conventional (Sanger) with high-throughput sequencing techniques (next-generation sequencing), three different screening techniques have been applied to characterise the binding properties of selected aptamer candidates.

In the brain, microglia represent the key innate immune cells, which are involved in brain development, brain maturation, and homeostasis. Impaired microglial function, either through aberrant activation or decreased functionality, can occur during aging and during neurodegeneration, and the resulting inflammation is thought to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases.

ASC speck-forming cells release the highly proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β in addition to ASC specks into the extracellular space during pyroptotic cell death. There ASC specks can propagate inflammation to other nonactivated cells or tissues. HIV-1 retroviral infection triggers inflammasome activation of abortively infected CD4 + T cells in secondary lymphatic tissues. However, if pyroptosis occurs in other peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HIV-1-infected patients is currently unknown. We investigated if ASC speck positive cells are present in the circulation of HIV-1-infected patients. Design and methods: PBMCs or plasma of HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy-naive patients were analyzed for the presence of ASC speck + cells or extracellular ASC and compared with healthy controls. Intracellular staining for ASC was employed to detect ASC speck + cells within PBMCs by flow cytometry, and ELISA to detect free ASC in the plasma. ASC multimerization was confirmed by immunoblot. Results: Peripheral blood CD14 ++ CD16 - monocytes were ASC speck + in HIV patients, but not in healthy controls. In the subgroup analysis, HIV patients with lower CD4 + T-cell counts and higher viral load had significantly more ASC speck + monocytes.

As a ligand of CCR4, CCL17 induces chemotaxis and facilitates T cell-DC interactions. We report the identification of two novel RNA aptamers, which were validated in vitro and in vivo for their capability to neutralize CCL17. Both aptamers efficiently inhibited the directed migration of the CCR4+ lymphoma line BW5147.3 toward CCL17 in a dose-dependent manner. To study the effect of these aptamers in vivo, we used a murine model of contact hypersensitivity. Systemic application of the aptamers significantly prevented ear swelling and T cell infiltration into the ears of sensitized mice after challenge with the contact sensitizer. The results of this proof-of-principle study establish aptamers as potent inhibitors of CCL17-mediated chemotaxis.

The process by which DNA or RNA is delivered into the cytosol of monocytes in systemic lupus erythematosus remains incompletely understood, and therapeutic approaches to prevent DNA-mediated monocyte activation are needed. We identified two mechanisms for internalization of DNA by monocytes. IgG-bound DNA was internalized by interacting with Fc gamma receptor IIa, while high-mobility group box-1 protein-bound DNA was internalized by interacting with the receptor for advanced glycation end products. Both pathways contribute to an inflammatory phenotype in monocytes exposed to serum from patients with SLE. Moreover, both of these pathways can be inhibited by a pentapeptide, DWEYS, which is a DNA mimetope. In one instance DWEYS directly competes with DNA for antibody binding and in the other DWEYS binds high-mobility group box-1 and blocks its interaction with RAGE.

Therefore, therapeutic targeting of inflammatory pathways is suggested to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular diseases. This concept was recently proven by CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study), which demonstrated the therapeutic potential of the monoclonal IL (interleukin)-1β-neutralizing antibody canakinumab. IL-1β and other IL-1 family cytokines are important vascular and systemic inflammatory mediators, which contribute to atherogenesis. The NLRP3 (NOD [nucleotide oligomerization domain]-, LRR [leucine-rich repeat]-, and PYD [pyrin domain]-containing protein 3) inflammasome, an innate immune signaling complex, is the key mediator of IL-1 family cytokine production in atherosclerosis. NLRP3 is activated by various endogenous danger signals abundantly present in atherosclerotic lesions, such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein and cholesterol crystals. Consequently, NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to the vascular inflammatory response driving atherosclerosis development and progression. Here, we review the mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and proinflammatory IL-1 family cytokine production in the context of atherosclerosis and discuss treatment possibilities in light of the positive outcomes of the CANTOS trial.",atherosclerosis | canakinumab | cytokines | inflammasomes | inflammation,196,1,NIH,1R01HL112661,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,4,2018-01

They process cytosolic evidence of infection, cell damage, or metabolic disturbances, and elicit a pro-inflammatory response mediated by members of the interleukin-1 family of cytokines and pyroptotoic cell death. On the molecular level, this is accomplished by the sensor-nucleated recruitment and oligomerization of the adapter protein ASC. Once a tunable threshold is reached, cooperative assembly of ASC into linear filaments and their condensation into macromolecular ASC specks promotes an all-or- none response. These structures are highly regulated and provide a unique signaling platform or compartment to control the activity of caspase-1 and likely other effectors. Emerging evidence indicates that ASC specks are also released from inflammasome-activated cells and accumulate in inflamed tissues, where they can continue to mature cytokines or be internalized by surrounding cells to further nucleate ASC specks in their cytosol. Little is known about the mechanisms governing ASC speck release, uptake, and endosomal escape, as well as its contribution to inflammation and disease.

High-dimensional techniques were used to elucidate transcriptional, phenotypic, and functional differences between human in vivo and in vitro generated mononuclear phagocytes to facilitate their full potential in the clinic. We demonstrate that monocytes differentiated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) resembled in vivo inflammatory macrophages, while moDCs resembled in vivo inflammatory DCs. Moreover, differentiated monocytes presented with profound transcriptomic, phenotypic, and functional differences. Monocytes integrated GM-CSF and IL-4 stimulation combinatorically and temporally, resulting in a mode- and time-dependent differentiation relying on NCOR2. Finally, moDCs are phenotypically heterogeneous and therefore necessitate the use of high-dimensional phenotyping to open new possibilities for better clinical tailoring of these cellular therapies. Monocyte-derived cellular derivatives are used clinically and are a crucial tool in basic research.

A characteristic feature is the generation of microglia-derived factors that play an essential role in the immune response. IL-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine released by activated microglia, able to exacerbate injury at elevated levels. In the presence of caspase-1, pro-IL-1β is cleaved to the mature cytokine following NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. Growing evidence suggests that ceramide plays a critical role in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, however, the relationship between ceramide and inflammasome activation in microglia remains unknown. Here, we investigated potential mechanistic links between ceramide as a modulator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and the resulting secretion of IL-1β using small bioactive enzyme stimulators and inhibitors of ceramide signaling in wild-type and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD knockout (ASC−/−) primary microglia. To induce the expression of inflammasome components, microglia were primed prior to experiments. Treatment with sodium palmitate (PA) induced de novo ceramide synthesis via modulation of its synthesizing protein serine palmitoyl transferase resulting in increased IL-1β secretion in microglia. Exposure of microglia to the serine palmitoyl transferase-inhibitor l-cycloserine significantly prevented PA-induced IL-1β secretion. Application of the ceramide analogue C2 and the sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor agonist Fingolimod (FTY720) up-regulated levels of IL-1β and cleaved caspase-1 in wild-type microglia, whereas ASC−/− microglia were unaffected. HPA-12 inhibition of ceramide transport did not affect inflammasome activation. Taken together, our findings reveal a critical role for ceramide as a positive modulator of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and the resulting release of IL-1β.

Recent studies have uncovered a bipartite mode of cytosolic DNA recognition, in which the cGAS-STING axis triggers antiviral immunity, whereas AIM2 triggers inflammasome activation. Here, we show that AIM2 is dispensable for DNA-mediated inflammasome activation in human myeloid cells. Instead, detection of cytosolic DNA by the cGAS-STING axis induces a cell death program initiating potassium efflux upstream of NLRP3. Forward genetics identified regulators of lysosomal trafficking to modulate this cell death program, and subsequent studies revealed that activated STING traffics to the lysosome, where it triggers membrane permeabilization and thus lysosomal cell death (LCD). Importantly, the cGAS-STING-NLRP3 pathway constitutes the default inflammasome response during viral and bacterial infections in human myeloid cells. We conclude that targeting the cGAS-STING-LCD-NLRP3 pathway will ameliorate pathology in inflammatory conditions that are associated with cytosolic DNA sensing. In humans, a cGAS-STING-lysosomal cell death-NLRP3 pathway is responsible for the inflammasome response to bacterial and viral DNA with AIM2 being dispensable.",AIM2 | Caspase-1 | cGAS | DNA | IL-1β | inflammasome | lysosomal cell death | NLRP3 | STING,182,1,H2020,ERC-2014-CoG - 647858 - GENESIS,E.L.

Cyclic oligosaccharide 2-hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin (BCD) is a compound that solubilizes lipophilic substances. Recently we have shown that BCD has an anti-inflammatory effect on CC via suppression of the inflammasome and liver X receptor activation. The putative effects of BCD on CC-induced complement activation remain unknown. In this study, we found that BCD bound to CC and reduced deposition of Igs, pattern recognition molecules, and complement factors on CC in human plasma. Furthermore, BCD decreased complement activation as measured by terminal complement complex and lowered the expression of complement receptors on monocytes in whole blood in response to CC exposure. In line with this, BCD also reduced reactive oxygen species formation caused by CC in whole blood. Furthermore, BCD attenuated the CC-induced proinflammatory cytokine responses (e.g., IL-1a, MIP-1a, TNF, IL-6, and IL-8) as well as regulated a range of CC-induced genes in human PBMC. BCD also regulated complement-related genes in human carotid plaques treated ex vivo. Formation of terminal complement complex on other complement-activating structures such as monosodium urate crystals and zymosan was not affected by BCD. These data demonstrate that BCD inhibits CC-induced inflammatory responses, which may be explained by BCDmediated attenuation of complement activation. Thus, these findings support the potential for using BCD in treatment of atherosclerosis.",,18,1,TRC,NCCD-2014,Hjerteforeningen,papers by authors,7,2017-10

However, scarce therapeutic options are available to treat obesity and the associated immunometabolic complications. Glucocorticoids are routinely employed for the management of inflammatory diseases, but their pleiotropic nature leads to detrimental metabolic side effects. We developed a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-dexamethasone co-agonist in which GLP-1 selectively delivers dexamethasone to GLP-1 receptor-expressing cells. GLP-1-dexamethasone lowers body weight up to 25% in obese mice by targeting the hypothalamic control of feeding and by increasing energy expenditure. This strategy reverses hypothalamic and systemic inflammation while improving glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The selective preference for GLP-1 receptor bypasses deleterious effects of dexamethasone on glucose handling, bone integrity, and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. Thus, GLP-1-directed glucocorticoid pharmacology represents a safe and efficacious therapy option for diet-induced immunometabolic derangements and the resulting obesity.

NLRP3 senses exogenous and endogenous insults, leading to inflammasome activation, which occurs spontaneously in patients with Muckle-Wells syndrome; BTK mutations cause the genetic immunodeficiency X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). However, to date, few proteins that regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activity in human primary immune cells have been identified, and clinically promising pharmacologic targeting strategies remain elusive. Objective: We sought to identify novel regulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human cells with a view to exploring interference with inflammasome activity at the level of such regulators. Methods: After proteome-wide phosphoproteomics, the identified novel regulator BTK was studied in human and murine cells by using pharmacologic and genetic BTK ablation. Results: Here we show that BTK is a critical regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation: pharmacologic (using the US Food and Drug Administration–approved inhibitor ibrutinib) and genetic (in patients with XLA and Btk knockout mice) BTK ablation in primary immune cells led to reduced IL-1β processing and secretion in response to nigericin and the Staphylococcus aureus toxin leukocidin AB (LukAB). BTK affected apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation and caspase-1 cleavage and interacted with NLRP3 and ASC. S aureus infection control in vivo and IL-1β release from cells of patients with Muckle-Wells syndrome were impaired by ibrutinib. Notably, IL-1β processing and release from immune cells isolated from patients with cancer receiving ibrutinib therapy were reduced. Conclusion: Our data suggest that XLA might result in part from genetic inflammasome deficiency and that NLRP3 inflammasome–linked inflammation could potentially be targeted pharmacologically through BTK.",Bruton tyrosine kinase | ibrutinib | IL-1 | inflammasome | inflammation | macrophage | Muckle-Wells syndrome | NLRP3 | Staphylococcus aureus | X-linked agammaglobulinemia,60,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,9,2017-10

After binding and activation from dsDNA, cGAS uses ATP and GTP to synthesize 2′, 3′ -cGAMP (cGAMP), a cyclic dinucleotide second messenger with mixed 2′-5′ and 3′-5′ phosphodiester bonds. Inappropriate stimulation of cGAS has been implicated in autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus, thus inhibition of cGAS may be of therapeutic benefit in some diseases; however, the size and polarity of the cGAS active site makes it a challenging target for the development of conventional substrate-competitive inhibitors. We report here the development of a high affinity (KD = 200 nM) inhibitor from a low affinity fragment hit with supporting biochemical and structural data showing these molecules bind to the cGAS active site. We also report a new high throughput cGAS fluorescence polarization (FP)-based assay to enable the rapid identification and optimization of cGAS inhibitors. This FP assay uses Cy5-labelled cGAMP in combination with a novel high affinity monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes cGAMP with no cross reactivity to cAMP, cGMP, ATP, or GTP. Given its role in the innate immune response, cGAS is a promising therapeutic target for autoinflammatory disease.

The signals activating other inflammasomes, NLRP3, NLRP6, and pyrin, are less well understood. Recent studies implicated several low-molecular-weight compounds traditionally linked to metabolism, not immunity, in modulation of inflammasome signaling. Furthermore, genetic, pharmacological, or pathogen-mediated interference with energy metabolism also affects inflammasome activation.

We discuss the different models of how glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism control the NLRP3 inflammasome. Finally, we summarize the findings on metabolic control of pyrin and point to open questions to be addressed to broaden our understanding of metabolism-inflammasome interactions.

How NLRP3 activation is regulated by transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms to prevent aberrant activation remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify three conserved phosphorylation sites in NLRP3 and demonstrate that NLRP3 activation is controlled by phosphorylation of its pyrin domain (PYD). Phosphomimetic residues in NLRP3 PYD abrogate inflammasome activation and structural modeling indicates that phosphorylation of the PYD regulates charge-charge interaction between two PYDs that are essential for NLRP3 activation. Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibition or knock-down drastically reduces NLRP3 activation, showing that PP2A can license inflammasome assembly via dephosphorylating NLRP3 PYD.

This immunostimulatory activity is attributable to high amounts of RNA present in the spore surface layer. RNA-sensing TLRs, TLR7, and TLR13 in mice and their human counterparts, are responsible for detecting and triggering the host cell response to BA spores, whereas TLR2 mediates the sensing of vegetative BA. BA spores, but not vegetative BA, induce type I IFN (IFN-I) production.

Recruitment of pro-caspase-1 to ASC promotes the autocatalytic activation of caspase-1, which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β. Upon triggering of inflammasome sensors, ASC assembles into large helical fibrils that interact with each other serving as a supramolecular signaling platform termed the ASC speck. Alternative splicing, post-translational modifications of ASC, as well as interaction with other proteins can perturb ASC function. In several inflammatory diseases, ASC specks can be found in the extracellular space and its presence correlates with poor prognosis.

Methods Hypertension was induced in male mice by uninephrectomy, deoxycorticosterone acetate (2.4 mg/d, s.c.) and replacement of drinking water with saline (1K/DOCA/salt). Control mice received uninephrectomy, a placebo pellet and normal drinking water. 10 days post-surgery, mice commenced treatment with anakinra (75 mg/kg/d, i.p.) or vehicle (0.9% saline, i.p.) for 11 days. Systolic BP was measured by tail cuff while qPCR, immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry were used to measure inflammatory markers, collagen and immune cell infiltration in the kidneys. Results By 10 days post-surgery, 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice displayed elevated systolic BP (148.3 ± 2.4 mmHg) compared to control mice (121.7 ± 2.7 mmHg; n = 18, P < 0.0001). The intervention with anakinra reduced BP in 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice by ∼20 mmHg (n = 16, P < 0.05), but had no effect in controls. In 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice, anakinra modestly reduced (∼30%) renal expression of some (CCL5, CCL2; n = 7–8; P < 0.05) but not all (ICAM-1, IL-6) inflammatory markers, and had no effect on immune cell infiltration (n = 7–8, P > 0.05). Anakinra reduced renal collagen content (n = 6, P < 0.01) but paradoxically appeared to exacerbate the renal and glomerular hypertrophy (n = 8-9, P < 0.001) that accompanied 1K/DOCA/salt-induced hypertension. Conclusion Despite its anti-hypertensive and renal anti-fibrotic actions, anakinra had minimal effects on inflammation and leukocyte infiltration in mice with 1K/DOCA/salt-induced hypertension. Future studies will assess whether the anti-hypertensive actions of anakinra are mediated by protective actions in other BP-regulating or salt-handling organs such as the arteries, skin and brain.",Anakinra | High blood pressure | IL-1β | Inflammasomes | Inflammation | Kidney,18,1,DAAD,Go8,Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst,papers by authors,2,2017-02

Fatal H7N9 infections are characterized by hyperinflammation and increased cellular infiltrates in the lung. Currently there are limited therapies to address the pathologies associated with H7N9 infection and the virulence factors that contribute to these pathologies. We have found that PB1-F2 derived from H7N9 activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces lung inflammation and cellular recruitment that is NLRP3-dependent. We have also shown that H7N9 and A/Puerto Rico/H1N1 (PR8)PB1-F2 peptide treatment induces significant mitochondrial reactive oxygen production, which contributes to NLRP3 activation. Importantly, treatment of cells or mice with the specific NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 significantly reduces IL-1β maturation, lung cellular recruitment, and cytokine production. Together, these results suggest that PB1-F2 from H7N9 avian influenza A virus may be a major contributory factor to disease pathophysiology and excessive inflammation characteristic of clinical infections and that targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome may be an effective means to reduce the inflammatory burden associated with H7N9 infections.",,45,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2017-01

In the present study, we sought to investigate whether uric acid, in the soluble form, could also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce the production of IL-1β. We monitored ROS, mitochondrial area and respiratory parameters from macrophages following sUA stimulus. We observed that sUA is released in a hypoxic environment and is able to induce IL-1β release. This process is followed by production of mitochondrial ROS, ASC speck formation and caspase-1 activation. Nlrp3 â '/â ' macrophages presented a protected redox state, increased maximum and reserve oxygen consumption ratio (OCR) and higher VDAC protein levels when compared to WT and Myd88 â '/â ' cells. Using a disease model characterized by increased sUA levels, we observed a correlation between sUA, inflammasome activation and fibrosis. These findings suggest sUA activates the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Clinically, diabetic neuropathy and HSAN1 are very similar, suggesting the involvement of deoxySLs in the pathology of both diseases. However, very little is known about the biology of these lipids and the underlying pathomechanism. We synthesized an alkyne analog of 1-deoxysphinganine (doxSA), the metabolic precursor of all deoxySLs, to trace the metabolism and localization of deoxySLs. Our results indicate that the metabolism of these lipids is restricted to only some lipid species and that they are not converted to canonical sphingolipids or fatty acids. Furthermore, exogenously added alkyne-doxSA [(2S,3R)- 2-aminooctadec-17-yn-3-ol] localized to mitochondria, causing mitochondrial fragmentation and dysfunction. The induced mitochondrial toxicity was also shown for natural doxSA, but not for sphinganine, and was rescued by inhibition of ceramide synthase activity. Our findings therefore indicate that mitochondrial enrichment of an N-acylated doxSA metabolite may contribute to the neurotoxicity seen in diabetic neuropathy and HSAN1. Hence, we provide a potential explanation for the characteristic vulnerability of peripheral nerves to elevated levels of deoxySLs.-Alecu, I., A. Tedeschi, N. Behler, K. Wunderling, C. Lamberz, M. A.

Many types of endogenous molecules have been shown to provoke such sterile inflammatory states when released from dying cells. However, a group of proteins referred to as alarmins have both intracellular and extracellular functions which have been the subject of intense research. Indeed, alarmins can either exert beneficial cell housekeeping functions, leading to tissue repair, or provoke deleterious uncontrolled inflammation. This group of proteins includes the high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-33 and the Ca 2+ -binding S100 proteins. These dual-function proteins share conserved regulatory mechanisms, such as secretory routes, post-translational modifications and enzymatic processing, that govern their extracellular functions in time and space.

We found that in response to apoptotic immune cells and live or dead Listeria monocytogenes scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), an anti-atherogenic lipid exchange mediator, activated internalization mechanisms with characteristics of macropinocytosis and, assisted by Golgi fragmentation, initiated autophagic responses. This was supported by scavenger receptor-induced local increases in membrane cholesterol concentrations which generated lipid domains particularly in cell extensions and the Golgi. SR-BI was a key driver of beclin-1-dependent autophagy during acute bacterial infection of the liver and spleen. Autophagy regulated tissue infiltration of neutrophils, suppressed accumulation of Ly6C+ (inflammatory) macrophages, and prevented hepatocyte necrosis in the core of infectious foci. Perifocal levels of Ly6C+ macrophages and Ly6C- macrophages were unaffected, indicating predominant regulation of the focus core. SR-BI-triggered autophagy promoted co-elimination of apoptotic immune cells and dead bacteria but barely influenced bacterial sequestration and survival or inflammasome activation, thus exclusively counteracting damage inflicted by immune responses. Hence, SR-BI-and autophagy promote a surveillance pathway that partially responds to products of antimicrobial defenses and selectively prevents immunity-induced damage during acute infection. Our findings suggest that control of infection-associated immunopathology can be based on a unified defense operation.",,12,1,NIAID,R01AI107250,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,2,2016-10

NLRP3 inflammasome activation leads to the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, as well as the subsequent release of biologically active IL-1β, IL-18, and other soluble mediators of inflammation. In this study, we further define the pharmacology of the previously reported NLRP3 inflammasome-selective, IL-1β processing inhibitor CP-456,773 (also known as MCC950), and we demonstrate its efficacy in two in vivo models of inflammation. Specifically, we show that in human and mouse innate immune cells CP-456,773 is an inhibitor of the cellular release of IL-1β, IL-1a, and IL-18, that CP-456,773 prevents inflammasome activation induced by disease-relevant soluble and crystalline NLRP3 stimuli, and that CP-456,773 inhibits R848- and imiquimod-induced IL-1β release. In mice, CP-456,773 demonstrates potent inhibition of the release of proinflammatory cytokines following acute i.p. challenge with LPS plus ATP in a manner that is proportional to the free/unbound concentrations of the drug, thereby establishing an in vivo pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for CP-456,773. Furthermore, CP-456,773 reduces ear swelling in an imiquimod cream-induced mouse model of skin inflammation, and it reduces airway inflammation in mice following acute challenge with house dust mite extract. These data implicate the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of dermal and airway inflammation, and they highlight the utility of CP-456,773 for interrogating the contribution of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its outputs in preclinical models of inflammation and disease.",,82,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2016-09

The bacterial components contained in dental calculus can be recognized by host immune sensors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and induce transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β. Studies have shown that cellular uptake of crystalline particles may trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to the cleavage of the IL-1β precursor to its mature form. Phagocytosis of dental calculus in the periodontal pocket may therefore lead to the secretion of IL-1β, promoting inflammatory responses in periodontal tissues. However, the capacity of dental calculus to induce IL-1β secretion in human phagocytes has not been explored. To study this, we stimulated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with dental calculus collected from periodontitis patients, and measured IL-1β secretion by ELISA. We found that calculus induced IL-1β secretion in both human PMNs and PBMCs. Calculus also induced IL-1β in macrophages from wildtype mice, but not in macrophages from NLRP3-And ASC-deficient mice, indicating the involvement of NLRP3 and ASC. IL-1β induction was inhibited by polymyxin B, suggesting that LPS is one of the components of calculus that induces pro-IL-1β transcription. To analyze the effect of the inorganic structure, we baked calculus at 250°C for 1 h. This baked calculus failed to induce pro-IL-1β transcription. However, it did induce IL-1β secretion in lipid A-primed cells, indicating that the crystalline structure of calculus induces inflammasome activation. Furthermore, hydroxyapatite crystals, a component of dental calculus, induced IL-1β in mouse macrophages, and baked calculus induced IL-1β in lipid A-primed human PMNs and PBMCs. These results indicate that dental calculus stimulates IL-1β secretionvia NLRP3 inflammasome in human and mouse phagocytes, and that the crystalline structure has a partial role in the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.",,9,1,JSPS,16K11836,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,papers by authors,1,2016-09

Analyses of numerous murine models of spontaneous SLE have revealed a critical role for endosomal TLRs in the production of autoantibodies and development of other clinical disease manifestations. Nevertheless, the corresponding TLR9-deficient autoimmune-prone strains consistently develop more severe disease pathology. Injection of BALB/c mice with 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD), commonly known as pristane, also results in the development of SLE-like disease. We now show that Tlr92/2 BALB/c mice injected i.p. with TMPD develop more severe autoimmunity than do their TLR-sufficient cohorts. Early indications include an increased accumulation of TLR7-expressing Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes at the site of injection, upregulation of IFNregulated gene expression in the peritoneal cavity, and an increased production of myeloid lineage precursors (common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte myeloid precursors) in the bone marrow. TMPD-injected Tlr92/2 BALB/c mice develop higher autoantibody titers against RNA, neutrophil cytoplasmic Ags, and myeloperoxidase than do TMPD-injected wild-type BALB/c mice. The TMP-injected Tlr92/2 mice, and not the wild-type mice, also develop a marked increase in glomerular IgG deposition and infiltrating granulocytes, much more severe glomerulonephritis, and a reduced lifespan. Collectively, the data point to a major role for TLR7 in the response to self-antigens in this model of experimental autoimmunity. Therefore, the BALB/c pristane model recapitulates other TLR7-driven spontaneous models of SLE and is negatively regulated by TLR9.",,32,1,NIH,AR066808,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2016-08

This suggests that pro-atherogenic stimuli, such as LDL cholesterol and high fat diets may impart longer lived signals on (innate) immune cells that persist even after reversing the pro-atherogenic stimuli. Recently, a series of studies challenged the traditional immunological paradigm that innate immune cells cannot display memory characteristics. Epigenetic reprogramming in these myeloid cell subsets, after exposure to certain stimuli, has been shown to alter the expression of genes upon re-exposure. This phenomenon has been termed trained innate immunity or innate immune memory. The changed responses of ‘trained’ innate immune cells can confer nonspecific protection against secondary infections, suggesting that innate immune memory has likely evolved as an ancient mechanism to protect against pathogens. However, dysregulated processes of immunological imprinting mediated by trained innate immunity may also be detrimental under certain conditions as the resulting exaggerated immune responses could contribute to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as atherosclerosis. Pro-atherogenic stimuli most likely cause epigenetic modifications that persist for prolonged time periods even after the initial stimulus has been removed. In this review we discuss the concept of trained innate immunity in the context of a hyperlipidemic environment and atherosclerosis. According to this idea the epigenome of myeloid (progenitor) cells is presumably modified for prolonged periods of time, which, in turn, could evoke a condition of continuous immune cell over-activation.",Atherosclerosis | Changed dietary components | Epigenetic reprogramming | Hyperlipidemia | Immuno-metabolism | Innate immune memory | Trained innate immunity,52,1,NIH,Exc1023,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2016-08

Administration of the specific NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 to mice from one day following IAV challenge resulted in hypersusceptibility to lethality. In contrast, delaying treatment with MCC950 until the height of disease (a more likely clinical scenario) significantly protected mice from severe and highly virulent IAV-induced disease. These findings identify for the first time that NLRP3 plays a detrimental role later in infection, contributing to IAV pathogenesis through increased cytokine production and lung cellular infiltrates.

Despite ongoing advances in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Continuous retention of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins in the subendothelial space causes a local overabundance of free cholesterol. Because cholesterol accumulation and deposition of cholesterol crystals (CCs) trigger a complex inflammatory response, we tested the efficacy of the cyclic oligosaccharide 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD), a compound that increases cholesterol solubility in preventing and reversing atherosclerosis. We showed that CD treatment of murine atherosclerosis reduced atherosclerotic plaque size and CC load and promoted plaque regression even with a continued cholesterol-rich diet. Mechanistically, CD increased oxysterol production in both macrophages and human atherosclerotic plaques and promoted liver X receptor (LXR)- mediated transcriptional reprogramming to improve cholesterol efflux and exert anti-inflammatory effects. In vivo, this CD-mediated LXR agonism was required for the antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effects of CD as well as for augmented reverse cholesterol transport. Because CD treatment in humans is safe and CD beneficially affects key mechanisms of atherogenesis, it may therefore be used clinically to prevent or treat human atherosclerosis.",,159,1,NIH,GSE67011,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2016-04

Clinical hypertension is associated with renal inflammation and elevated circulating levels of IL-1β and IL-18. Therefore, we investigated whether hypertension in mice is associated with increased expression and/or activation of the inflammasome in the kidney, and if inhibition of inflammasome activity reduces BP, markers of renal inflammation and fibrosis. Experimental Approach Wild-type and inflammasome-deficient ASC-/- mice were uninephrectomized and received deoxycorticosterone acetate and saline to drink (1K/DOCA/salt). Control mice were uninephrectomized but received a placebo pellet and water. BP was measured by tail cuff; renal expression of inflammasome subunits and inflammatory markers was measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting; macrophage and collagen accumulation was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Key Results 1K/DOCA/salt-induced hypertension in mice was associated with increased renal mRNA expression of inflammasome subunits NLRP3, ASC and pro-caspase-1, and the cytokine, pro-IL-1β, as well as protein levels of active caspase-1 and mature IL-1β. Following treatment with 1K/DOCA/salt, ASC-/- mice displayed blunted pressor responses and were also protected from increases in renal expression of IL-6, IL-17A, CCL2, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and accumulation of macrophages and collagen. Finally, treatment with a novel inflammasome inhibitor, MCC950, reversed hypertension in 1K/DOCA/salt-treated mice. Conclusions and Implications Renal inflammation, fibrosis and elevated BP induced by 1K/DOCA/salt treatment are dependent on inflammasome activity, highlighting the inflammasome/IL-1β pathway as a potential therapeutic target in hypertension.",,94,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2016-02

To systematically determine the roles of proteins in canonical TLR signaling pathways, we conducted an RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen in human and mouse macrophages. We observed a pattern of conserved signaling module dependencies across species, but found notable species-specific requirements at the level of individual proteins. Among these, weidentified unexpected differences in the involvement of members of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family between the human andmouse TLR pathways. Whereas TLR signaling inmousemacrophages depended primarily on IRAK4 and IRAK2, with little or no role for IRAK1, TLR signaling and proinflammatory cytokine production in human macrophages depended on IRAK1, with knockdown of IRAK4 or IRAK2 having less of an effect. Consistent with species-specific roles for these kinases, IRAK4 orthologs failed to rescue signaling in IRAK4-deficient macrophages from the other species, and only mouse macrophages required the kinase activity of IRAK4 to mediate TLR responses. The identification of a critical role for IRAK1 in TLR signaling in humans could potentially explain the association of IRAK1 with several autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, this study demonstrated how systematic screening can be used to identify important characteristics of innate immune responses across species, which could optimize therapeutic targeting to manipulate human TLR-dependent outputs.",,39,1,NIH,AI082265,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2016-01

These complexes enable activation of an inflammatory protease caspase-1, leading to a cell death process called pyroptosis and to proteolytic cleavage and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18. Along with caspase-1, inflammasome components include an adaptor protein, ASC, and a sensor protein, which triggers the inflammasome assembly in response to a danger signal. The inflammasome sensor proteins are pattern recognition receptors belonging either to the NOD-like receptor (NLR) or to the AIM2-like receptor family. While the molecular agonists that induce inflammasome formation by AIM2 and by several other NLRs have been identified, it is not well understood how the NLR family member NLRP3 is activated. Given that NLRP3 activation is relevant to a range of human pathological conditions, significant attempts are being made to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this process. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the molecular events that lead to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to a range of K+ efflux-inducing danger signals. We also comment on the reported involvement of cytosolic Ca2+ fluxes on NLRP3 activation. We outline the recent advances in research on the physiological and pharmacological mechanisms of regulation of NLRP3 responses, and we point to several open questions regarding the current model of NLRP3 activation.",,97,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2016-01

SMV treatment significantly decreased hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, but had no significant effect on steatosis and hepatic cholesterol content in NASH. SMV blunted fibrosis due to inhibition of both RhoA/Rho kinase and Ras/ERK pathways. Interestingly, inhibition of RAC1 and Ras (by LT) failed to decrease fibrosis to the same extent.

Hence, due to the considerably large size of these structures, ASC specks can be easily visualized by microscopy as a simple upstream readout for inflammasome activation. Here, we provide two detailed protocols for imaging ASC specks: by (1) live-cell imaging of monocyte/macrophage cell lines expressing a fluorescently tagged version of ASC and (2) immunofluorescence of endogenous ASC in cell lines and human immune cells.

The most proximal events that initiate signal transduction frequently are receptor dimerization or conformational changes in receptor complexes. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane receptors that are activated by a number of exogenous and endogenous ligands. Most TLRs can respond to multiple ligands and the different TLRs recognize structurally diverse molecules ranging from proteins, sugars, lipids, and nucleic acids. TLRs can be expressed on the plasma membrane or in endosomal compartments and ligand recognition thus proceeds in different microenvironments. Not surprisingly, distinctive mechanisms of TLR receptor activation have evolved. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of TLR activation is important for the development of novel synthetic TLR activators or pharmacological inhibitors of TLRs. Confocal laser scanning microscopy combined with GFP technology allows the direct visualization of TLR expression in living cells. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements between two differentially tagged proteins permit the study of TLR interaction, and distances between receptors in the range of molecular interactions can be measured and visualized.

While inflammasome signaling participates in these interactions, its activators and microbiome-modulating mechanisms are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the microbiota-associated metabolites taurine, histamine, and spermine shape the host-microbiome interface by co-modulating NLRP6 inflammasome signaling, epithelial IL-18 secretion, and downstream anti-microbial peptide (AMP) profiles. Distortion of this balanced AMP landscape by inflammasome deficiency drives dysbiosis development. Upon fecal transfer, colitis-inducing microbiota hijacks this microenvironment-orchestrating machinery through metabolite-mediated inflammasome suppression, leading to distorted AMP balance favoring its preferential colonization. Restoration of the metabolite-inflammasome-AMP axis reinstates a normal microbiota and ameliorates colitis. Together, we identify microbial modulators of the NLRP6 inflammasome and highlight mechanisms by which microbiome-host interactions cooperatively drive microbial community stability through metabolite-mediated innate immune modulation. Therefore, targeted ""postbiotic"" metabolomic intervention may restore a normal microenvironment as treatment or prevention of dysbiosis-driven diseases.",,438,1,NCI,P30CA016359,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,2015-12

The G protein-coupled chemokine receptor CX3CR1 plays a central role in several metabolic syndrome-related disease manifestations and is involved in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Because diet-induced intestinal dysbiosis is a driver for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, we hypothesized that CX3CR1 may influence the development of steatohepatitis. In two independent models of diet-induced steatohepatitis (high-fat diet and methionine/choline-deficient diet), CX3CR1 protected mice from excessive hepatic steatosis and inflammation, as well as systemic glucose intolerance. Lack of Cx3cr1 expression was associated with significantly altered intestinal microbiota composition, which was linked to an impaired intestinal barrier. Concomitantly, endotoxin levels in portal serum and inflammatory macrophages in liver were increased in Cx3cr1-/- mice, indicating an increased inflammatory response. Depletion of intestinal microbiota by administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics suppressed the number of infiltrating macrophages and promoted macrophage polarization in liver. Consequently, antibiotic-treated mice demonstrated a marked improvement of steatohepatitis. Conclusion: Microbiota-mediated activation of the innate immune responses through CX3CR1 is crucial for controlling steatohepatitis progression, which recognizes CX3CR1 as an essential gatekeeper in this scenario.

In the setting of impaired renal clearance of GBCAs, Gd deposits in various tissues and fibrosis subsequently develops. However, the precise mechanism by which fibrosis occurs in NSF is incompletely understood. Because other profibrotic agents, such as silica or asbestos, activate the nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and initiate interleukin (IL)-1β release with the subsequent development of fibrosis, we evaluated the effects of GBCAs on inflammasome activation. Methods: Bone marrow derived macrophages from C57BL/6, Nlrp3-/- and Asc-/- mice were incubated with three Gd-containing compounds and IL-1β activation and secretion was detected by ELISA and western blot analysis. Inflammasome activation and regulation was investigated in IL-4- and interferon (IFN)γ-polarised macrophages by ELISA, quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR and NanoString nCounter analysis. Furthermore, C57BL/6 and Nlrp3-/- mice were intraperitoneally injected with GBCA and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the peritoneum was analysed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Results: Free Gd and GBCAs activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce IL-1β secretion in vitro. Gd-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid also induces the recruitment of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes to the peritoneum in vivo. Gd activated IL-4-polarised macrophages more effectively than IFNγ-polarised macrophages, which preferentially expressed genes known to downregulate inflammasome activity. Conclusions: These data suggest that Gd released from GBCAs triggers a NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent inflammatory response that leads to fibrosis in an appropriate clinical setting. The preferential activation of IL-4-differentiated macrophages is consistent with the predominantly fibrotic presentation of NSF.",,24,0,NHLBI,HL093262,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,2015-11

However, the expression of these inflammatory mediators is tightly regulated, as uncontrolled production can result in tissue damage and lead to chronic inflammatory conditions and autoimmune diseases. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an important transcriptional modulator that limits the inflammatory response by controlling the expression of a number of cytokines and chemokines. However, its role in modulating IFN responses remains poorly defined. In this study, we demonstrate that ATF3 expression in macrophages is necessary for governing basal IFN-β expression, as well as the magnitude of IFN-β cytokine production following activation of innate immune receptors. We found that ATF3 acted as a transcriptional repressor and regulated IFN-β via direct binding to a previously unidentified specific regulatory site distal to the Ifnb1 promoter. Additionally, we observed that ATF3 itself is a type I IFN-inducible gene, and that ATF3 further modulates the expression of a subset of inflammatory genes downstream of IFN signaling, suggesting it constitutes a key component of an IFN negative feedback loop. Consistent with this, macrophages deficient in Atf3 showed enhanced viral clearance in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and vesicular stomatitis virus infection models. Our study therefore demonstrates an important role for ATF3 in modulating IFN responses in macrophages by controlling basal and inducible levels of IFNb, as well as the expression of genes downstream of IFN signaling.",,48,1,ERC,undefined,European Research Council,papers by authors,0,2015-11

Increased lysosomal cholesterol storage and cholesterol crystallization inside macrophages have been linked to several metabolic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Two-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-B-CD) is able to redirect lysosomal cholesterol to the cytoplasm in Niemann-Pick type C1 disease, a lysosomal storage disorder. We hypothesize that HP-B-CD ameliorates liver cholesterol and intracellular cholesterol levels inside Kupffer cells (KCs). Hyperlipidemic low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr−/−) mice were given weekly, subcutaneous injections with HP-B-CD or control PBS. In contrast to control injections, hyperlipidemic mice treated with HP-B-CD demonstrated a shift in intracellular cholesterol distribution towards cytoplasmic cholesteryl ester (CE) storage and a decrease in cholesterol crystallization inside KCs. Compared to untreated hyperlipidemic mice, the foamy KC appearance and liver cholesterol remained similar upon HP-B-CD administration, while hepatic campesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol levels were back increased. Thus, HP-B-CD could be a useful tool to improve intracellular cholesterol levels in the context of the metabolic syndrome, possibly through modulation of phyto- and oxysterols, and should be tested in the future.

To identify a potential molecular link between these mechanisms, we investigated whether lipofuscin-mediated phototoxicity activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in RPE cells in vitro. We found that blue light irradiation (dominant wavelength 448 nm, irradiance 0.8 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, duration 6 h) of lipofuscin-loaded primary human RPE cells and ARPE-19 cells induced photooxidative damage, lysosomal membrane permeabilization (79.5 % of cells vs. 3.8 % in nonirradiated controls), and cytosolic leakage of lysosomal enzymes. This resulted in activation of the inflammasome with activation of caspase-1 and secretion of interleukin-1β (14.6 vs. 0.9 pg/ml in nonirradiated controls) and interleukin-18 (87.7 vs. 0.2 pg/ml in nonirradiated controls). Interleukin secretion was dependent on the activity of NLRP3, caspase-1, and lysosomal proteases cathepsin B and L. These results demonstrate that accumulation of lipofuscin-like material in vitro renders RPE cells susceptible to phototoxic destabilization of lysosomes, resulting in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. This new mechanism of inflammasome activation links photooxidative damage and innate immune activation in RPE pathology and may provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention in retinal diseases such as AMD. Key message: • Visible light irradiation of lipofuscin-loaded RPE cells activates inflammasome. • Inflammasome activation results from lysosomal permeabilization and enzyme leakage. • Inflammasome activation induces secretion of inflammatory cytokines by RPE cells. • Photooxidative damage by visible light as new mechanism of inflammasome activation. • Novel link between hallmark pathogenetic features of retinal degenerative diseases.",Age-related macular degeneration | Interleukin-1β | Lipid peroxidation | Lysosomal membrane permeabilization | Retinal pigment epithelium,52,1,DFG,KR 2863/7-1,Pfizer,papers by authors,0,2015-08

Additionally, the host immune response is thought to play a critical role in disease onset. Neutrophils are known to be a key host response factor to bacterial challenge on host surfaces. Release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as a novel antimicrobial defense strategy has gained increasing attention in the past years. Here, we investigated the influx of neutrophils into the dental plaque and the ability of oral bacteria to trigger intra-biofilm release of NETs and intracellular proteins. Methods: Supragingival biofilms and whole saliva were sampled from systemically healthy subjects participating in an experimental gingivitis study. Biofilms were analysed by immunofluorescence followed by confocal and fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, concentrations of cytokines and immune-associated proteins in biofilm suspensions and saliva were assessed by ELISA. Neutrophils obtained from blood were stimulated with twelve bacterial species isolated from cultured biofilms or with lipopolysaccharide to monitor NET formation. Results: Neutrophils, NETs, neutrophil-associated proteins (myeloperoxidase, elastase-2, cathepsin G, cathelicidin LL-37), interleukin-8, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor were detected within plaque samples and saliva. All tested bacterial species as well as the polymicrobial samples isolated from the plaque of each donor induced release of NETs and interleukin-8. The degree of NET formation varied among different subjects and did not correlate with plaque scores or clinical signs of local inflammation. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that neutrophils are attracted towards dental biofilms, in which they become incorporated and where they are stimulated by microbes to release NETs and immunostimulatory proteins. Thus, neutrophils and NETs may be involved in host biofilm control, although their specific role needs to be further elucidated. Moreover, inter-patient variability suggests NET formation as a potential factor influencing the individual course of disease.",Bacteria | Interleukin-8 | NET | Neutrophils | Oral biofilm,34,0,DFG,2-RST-2013,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,papers by authors,0,2015-06

Through a screen of 29 AMOs targeting common miRNAs, we found a subset of sequences highly inhibitory to TLR7 sensing in mouse macrophages. Interspecies conservation of this inhibitory activity was confirmed on TLR7/8 activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Significantly, we identified a core motif governing the inhibitory activity of these AMOs, which is present in more than 50 AMOs targeted to human miRNAs in miRBaseV20. DNA/locked nucleic acids (LNA) AMOs synthesized with a phosphorothioate backbone also inhibited TLR7 sensing in a sequence-dependent manner, demonstrating that the off-target effects of AMOs are not restricted to 2′OMe modification.

However, TLR13 is not expressed in humans, and the identity of its human homolog remains elusive. Moreover, the contribution of bacterial RNA to the induction of innate immune responses against entire bacteria is still insufficiently defined. In the current study, we show that human monocytes respond to bacterial RNAwith secretion of IL-6, TNF, and IFN-β, which is critically dependent on lysosomal maturation. Using small interfering RNA and overexpression, we unambiguously identify TLR8 as receptor for bacterial RNA in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. We further demonstrate that the sequence motif sensed by TLR8 is clearly distinct from that recognized by TLR13.

Misfolded and aggregated proteins bind to pattern recognition receptors on microglia and astroglia, and trigger an innate immune response characterised by release of inflammatory mediators, which contribute to disease progression and severity. Genome-wide analysis suggests that several genes that increase the risk for sporadic Alzheimer's disease encode factors that regulate glial clearance of misfolded proteins and the inflammatory reaction. External factors, including systemic inflammation and obesity, are likely to interfere with immunological processes of the brain and further promote disease progression.

MCC950 reduced interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production in vivo and attenuated the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a disease model of multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, MCC950 treatment rescued neonatal lethality in a mouse model of CAPS and was active in ex vivo samples from individuals with Muckle-Wells syndrome.

The involvement of TLR4 and the multiligand receptor for advanced glycation end products as receptors during MRP8-mediated effects on inflammation remains controversial. By comparative bioinformatic analysis of genome-wide response patterns of human monocytes to MRP8, endotoxins, and various cytokines, we have developed a model in which TLR4 is the dominant receptor for MRP8-mediated phagocyte activation. The relevance of the TLR4 signaling pathway was experimentally validated using human and murine models of TLR4- And receptor for advanced glycation end products-dependent signaling. Furthermore, our systems biology approach has uncovered an antiapoptotic role for MRP8 in monocytes, which was corroborated by independent functional experiments. Our data confirm the primary importance of the TLR4/MRP8 axis in the activation of human monocytes, representing a novel and attractive target for modulation of the overwhelming innate immune response.",,44,1,,CRC 1009 B8,,papers by authors,0,2015-01

Additionally, KOIN can identify 'hyper ChIPable regions' as another source of false-positive signals. As the use of the KOIN algorithm reduces false-positive results and thereby prevents misinterpretation of ChIP-seq data, it should be considered as the gold standard for future ChIP-seq analyses, particularly when developing ChIP-assays with novel antibody reagents.",,16,1,NIH,R01HL093262,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2014-12

While high genome editing activities can be achieved in various cellular systems, obtaining cell clones that contain all-allelic frameshift mutations at the target locus of interest remains a laborious task. To this end, we have developed an easy-to-follow deep sequencing workflow and the evaluation tool OutKnocker (www.OutKnocker.org), which allows convenient, reliable, and cost-effective identification of knockout cell lines.",,69,1,,ERC 2009 StG 243046,,papers by authors,0,2014-10

Destruction of YxxΦ abolished TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 activity toward nucleic acids in human B cells and monocytes, whereas TLR8 responses toward small molecules remained intact. YxxΦ in UNC93B1 influenced the subcellular localization of human UNC93B1 via both adapter protein complex (AP)1- and AP2-dependent trafficking pathways.

Many adjuvants in clinical development are particulates, but how they drive innate and adaptive immune responses remains poorly understood. Studies have shown that a number of vaccine adjuvants activate inflammasome pathways in isolated APCs. However, the contribution of inflammasome activation to vaccine-mediated immunity in vivo remains controversial. In this study, we evaluated immune cell responses to the ISCOMATRIX adjuvant (IMX) in mice. Like other particulate vaccine adjuvants, IMX potently activated the NALP-3-ASC-Caspase-1 inflammasome in APCs, leading to IL-1β and IL-18 production. The IL-18R pathway, but not IL-1R, was required for early innate and subsequent cellular immune responses to a model IMX vaccine. APCs directly exposed to IMX underwent an endosome-mediated cell-death response, which we propose initiates inflammatory events locally at the injection site. Importantly, both inflammasome-related and -unrelated pathways contributed to IL-18 dependence in vivo following IMX administration. TNF-α provided a physiological priming signal for inflammasome-dependent IL-18 production by APCs, which correlated with reduced vaccine-mediated immune cell responses in TNF-α- or TNFR-deficient mice. Taken together, our findings highlight an important disconnect between the mechanisms of vaccine adjuvant action in vitro versus in vivo.

CC appear early in the atheroma development and trigger inflammation by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In this study we hypothesized whether CC employ the complement system to activate inflammasome/caspase-1, leading to release of mature IL-1b, and whether complement activation regulates CC-induced cytokine production. In this study we describe that CC activated both the classical and alternative complement pathways, and C1q was found to be crucial for the activation. CC employed C5a in the release of a number of cytokines in whole blood, including IL-1β and TNF. CC induced minimal amounts of cytokines in C5-deficient whole blood, until reconstituted with C5. Furthermore, C5a and TNF in combination acted as a potent primer for CC-induced IL-1β release by increasing IL-1β transcripts. CC-induced complement activation resulted in upregulation of complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18), leading to phagocytosis of CC. Also, CC mounted a complement- dependent production of reactive oxygen species and active caspase-1. We conclude that CC employ the complement system to induce cytokines and activate the inflammasome/caspase-1 by regulating several cellular responses in human monocytes. In light of this, complement inhibition might be an interesting therapeutic approach for treatment of atherosclerosis.

We identified two compounds, AT791 {3-[4- (6-(3-(dimethylamino)propoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)phenoxy]-N, N-dimethylpropan-1-amine} and E6446 {6-[3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl) propoxy)-2-(4-(3- (pyrrolidin-1-yl)propoxy)phenyl]benzo[d]oxazole}, that inhibit Toll-like receptor (TLR)7 and 9 signaling in a variety of human and mouse cell types and inhibit DNA-TLR9 interaction in vitro. When administered to mice, these compounds suppress responses to challenge doses of cytidine-phosphate-guanidine (CpG)-containing DNA, which stimulates TLR9. When given chronically in spontaneous mouse lupus models, E6446 slowed development of circulating antinuclear antibodies and had a modest effect on anti-double-stranded DNA titers but showed no observable impact on proteinuria or mortality. We discovered that the ability of AT791 and E6446 to inhibit TLR7 and 9 signaling depends on two properties: weak interaction with nucleic acids and high accumulation in the intracellular acidic compartments where TLR7 and 9 reside. Binding of the compounds to DNA prevents DNA-TLR9 interaction in vitro and modulates signaling in vivo. Our data also confirm an earlier report that this same mechanism may explain inhibition of TLR7 and 9 signaling by hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil; Sanofi- Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ), a drug commonly prescribed to treat lupus. Thus, very different structural classes of molecules can inhibit endosomal TLRs by essentially identical mechanisms of action, suggesting a general mechanism for targeting this group of TLRs.

Analysis of this data set revealed a spectrum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identified central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation complemented by regulators related to stimulus-specific programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients.

We previously proposed that Hz can carry plasmodial DNA into a subcellular compartment that is accessible to Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), inducing an inflammatory signal. Hz also activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in primed cells. We found that Hz appears to colocalize with DNA in infected erythrocytes, even before RBC rupture or phagolysosomal digestion. Using synthetic Hz coated invitro with plasmodial genomic DNA (gDNA) or CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, we observed that DNA-complexed Hz induced TLR9 translocation, providing a priming and an activation signal for inflammasomes. After phagocytosis, Hz and DNA dissociate. Hz subsequently induces phagolysosomal destabilization, allowing phagolysosomal contents access to the cytosol, where DNA receptors become activated. Similar observations were made with Plasmodium-infected RBCs. Finally, infected erythrocytes activated both the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes. These observations suggest that Hz and DNA work together to induce systemic inflammation during malaria. © 2014 The Authors.",,108,1,NIH,R01AI079293,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2014-01

However, the stimuli and cellular mechanisms responsible for such inflammatory responses remain poorly defined. Inflammasomes are crucial initiators of sterile inflammation in other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and gout. These pattern recognition receptors detect host-derived danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as microcrystals and reactive oxygen species, and respond by inducing activation of caspase-1. Caspase-1 then processes the cytokines pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms thus triggering inflammation. While IL-1β and IL-18 are known to be elevated in hypertensive patients, no studies have examined whether this occurs downstream of inflammasome activation or whether inhibition of inflammasome and/or IL-1β/IL-18 signalling prevents hypertension. In this review, we will discuss some known actions of IL-1β and IL-18 on leukocyte and vessel wall function that could potentially underlie a prohypertensive role for these cytokines. We will describe the major classes of inflammasome-activating DAMPs and present evidence that at least some of these are elevated in the setting of hypertension. Finally, we will provide information on drugs that are currently used to inhibit inflammasome/IL-1β/IL-18 signalling and how these might ultimately be used as therapeutic agents for the clinical management of hypertension.",,103,1,NSF,1062721,National Science Foundation,papers by authors,0,2014-01

TLR4 is a widely expressed TLR, responsible for initiating potent immune responses to LPS. TRAM acts to bridge TLR4 with TRIF, orchestrating the inflammatory response to pathogen challenge. We have identified a putative TRAF6-binding motif in TRAM that could mediate a novel signaling function for TRAM in TLR4 signaling. TRAM and TRAF6 association was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous, ectopically expressed and recombinant proteins, which was ablated upon mutation of a key Glu residue in TRAM (TRAM E183A). TRAF6 and TRAM were observed colocalizing using confocal microscopy following ectopic expression in cells and the ability of TRAM and TRAM E183Ato activate luciferase-linked reporter assays was determined in HEK293 and TRAF6-deficient cells. Importantly, TRAM-deficient macrophages reconstituted with TRAM E183A display significantly reduced inflammatory TNF-α, IL-6, and RANTES protein production compared with WT TRAM. These results demonstrate a novel role for TRAM in TLR4-mediated signaling in regulating inflammatory responses via its interaction with TRAF6, distinct from its role as a bridging adaptor between TLR4 and TRIF. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.",Inflammation | Innate immunity | Signal transduction | Toll-like receptors,24,1,MRC,G1000133,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2014-01

In addition, phagocytosis of ASC specks by macrophages induced lysosomal damage and nucleation of soluble ASC, as well as activation of IL-1β in recipient cells.

Microglia and other cell types in the brain can be activated in response to misfolded proteins or aberrantly localized nucleic acids. This diverts microglia from their physiological and beneficial functions, and leads to their sustained release of pro-inflammatory mediators. In this Review, we discuss how the activation of innate immune signalling pathways-in particular, the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome-by aberrant host proteins may be a common step in the development of diverse neurodegenerative disorders. During chronic activation of microglia, the sustained exposure of neurons to pro-inflammatory mediators can cause neuronal dysfunction and contribute to cell death. As chronic neuroinflammation is observed at relatively early stages of neurodegenerative disease, targeting the mechanisms that drive this process may be useful for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The NLRP3 inflammasome is of special interest because it can assemble in response to a diverse array of stimuli and because the inflammation it triggers has been implicated in a wide variety of disease pathologies. To avoid aberrant activation, the NLRP3 inflammasome is modulated on multiple levels, ranging from transcriptional control to post-translational protein modifications. Emerging genetic and pharmacological evidence suggests that NLRP3 inflammasome activation may also be involved in acute lung inflammation after viral infection and during progression of several chronic pulmonary diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma.

They act as sensors for endogenous and exogenous signals, and mediate the processing of pro-IL-1β into its secreted, biologically active form. The NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β are particularly interesting because they are required for efficient control of viral infections. Indeed, HIV-1 induces expression of NLRP3 and IL-1β in healthy controls, but not in HIV-1-infected patients. Here we evaluate whether HIV-1 can induce activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Methods: Human primary monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with HIV-1 in the absence or presence of classical NLRP3 inflammasome activators, and IL-1β release was assessed by ELISA. Results: HIV-1 initiates the priming signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation through the NF-κB-associated pathway in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Furthermore, priming of NLRP3 activation in response to HIV-1 was independent of the viral envelope, since similar results were observed with HIV-1 and pseudotyped HIV-1 lacking the env gene. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that HIV-1 infection promotes IL-1β secretion by inducing the first signal for NLRP3 inflammasome activation, a phenomenon that may contribute to AIDS progression.

Information exchange allowing immune cells to collaborate is generally attributed to soluble protein factors secreted by pathogen-sensing cells. Cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNs), serve to alert non-infected cells to the possibility of pathogen challenge. Moreover, in conjunction with chemokines they can instruct specialized immune cells to contain and eradicate microbial infection. Several receptors and signalling pathways exist that couple pathogen sensing to the induction of cytokines, whereas cytosolic recognition of nucleic acids seems to be exquisitely important for the activation of type I IFNs, master regulators of antiviral immunity. Cytosolic DNA is sensed by the receptor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which catalyses the synthesis of the second messenger cGAMP(2'-5'). This molecule in turn activates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident receptor STING, thereby inducing an antiviral state and the secretion of type I IFNs. Here we find in murine and human cells that cGAS-synthesized cGAMP(2'-5') is transferred from producing cells to neighbouring cells through gap junctions, where it promotes STING activation and thus antiviral immunity independently of type I IFN signalling. In line with the limited cargo specificity of connexins, the proteins that assemble gap junction channels, most connexins tested were able to confer this bystander immunity, thus indicating a broad physiological relevance of this local immune collaboration. Collectively, these observations identify cGAS-triggered cGAMP(2'-5') transfer as a novel host strategy that serves to rapidly convey antiviral immunity in a transcription-independent, horizontal manner. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

One exception is mice injected with 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD), a hydrocarbon oil commonly known as pristane, which induces systemic lupus erythematosus-like disease. Although Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) interactions have been strongly implicated in the activation-induced cell death of both lymphocytes and other APCs, FasL can also trigger the production of proinflammatory cytokines. FasL is a transmembrane protein with a matrix metalloproteinase cleavage site in the ectodomain. Matrix metalloproteinase cleavage inactivates membrane-bound FasL and releases a soluble form reported to have both antagonist and agonist activity. To better understand the impact of FasL cleavage on both the proapoptotic and proinflammatory activity of FasL, its cleavage site was deleted through targeted mutation to produce the deleted cleavage site (ΔCS) mouse line. ΔCS mice express higher levels of membrane-bound FasL than do wild-type mice and fail to release soluble FasL. To determine to what extent FasL promotes inflammation in lupus mice, TMPD-injected FasL-deficient and ΔCS BALB/c mice were compared with control TMPD-injected BALB/c mice. We found that FasL deficiency significantly reduced the early inflammatory exudate induced by TMPD injection. In contrast, ΔCS mice developed a markedly exacerbated disease profile associated with a higher frequency of splenic neutrophils and macrophages, a profound change in anti-nuclear Ab specificity, and markedly increased proteinuria and kidney pathology compared with controls. These results demonstrate that FasL promotes inflammation in TMPD-induced autoimmunity, and its cleavage limits FasL proinflammatory activity.

Soluble endogenous ligands, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), amyloid-β and amylin peptides, accumulate in such diseases. Here we identify an endocytic pathway mediated by the pattern-recognition receptor CD36 that coordinated the intracellular conversion of those soluble ligands into crystals or fibrils, which resulted in lysosomal disruption and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Consequently, macrophages that lacked CD36 failed to elicit IL-1β production in response to those ligands, and targeting CD36 in atherosclerotic mice resulted in lower serum concentrations of IL-1β and accumulation of cholesterol crystals in plaques. Collectively, our findings highlight the importance of CD36 in the accrual and nucleation of NLRP3 ligands from within the macrophage and position CD36 as a central regulator of inflammasome activation in sterile inflammation. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

Pyroptotic cell death induced by anthrax lethal toxin (LT) is a model for inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation. We discovered 7-desacetoxy-6,7-dehydrogedunin (7DG) in a phenotypic screen as a small molecule that protects macrophages from LT-induced death. Using chemical proteomics, we identified protein kinase R (PKR) as the target of 7DG and show that RNAi knockdown of PKR phenocopies treatment with 7DG. Further, we show that PKR's role in ASC assembly and caspase-1 activation induced by several different inflammasome stimuli is independent of PKR's kinase activity, demonstrating that PKR has a previously uncharacterized role in caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis that is distinct from its reported kinase-dependent roles in apoptosis and inflammasome formation in lipopolysaccharide-primed cells. Remarkably, PKR has different roles in two distinct cell death pathways and has a broad role in inflammasome function relevant in other diseases. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

The PB1-F2 of pathogenic influenza A viruses (IAV) contributes to the pathophysiology of infection, although the mechanism for this is unclear. The NLRP3-inflammasome has been implicated in IAV pathogenesis, but whether IAV virulence proteins can be activators of the complex is unknown. We investigated whether PB1-F2-mediated activation of the NLRP3-inflammasome is a mechanism contributing to overt inflammatory responses to IAV infection. We show PB1-F2 induces secretion of pyrogenic cytokine IL-1β by activating the NLRP3-inflammasome, contributing to inflammation triggered by pathogenic IAV. Compared to infection with wild-type virus, mice infected with reverse engineered PB1-F2-deficient IAV resulted in decreased IL-1β secretion and cellular recruitment to the airways. Moreover, mice exposed to PB1-F2 peptide derived from pathogenic IAV had enhanced IL-1β secretion compared to mice exposed to peptide derived from seasonal IAV. Implicating the NLRP3-inflammasome complex specifically, we show PB1-F2 derived from pathogenic IAV induced IL-1β secretion was Caspase-1-dependent in human PBMCs and NLRP3-dependent in mice. Importantly, we demonstrate PB1-F2 is incorporated into the phagolysosomal compartment, and upon acidification, induces ASC speck formation. We also show that high molecular weight aggregated PB1-F2, rather than soluble PB1-F2, induces IL-1β secretion. Furthermore, NLRP3-deficient mice exposed to PB1-F2 peptide or infected with PB1-F2 expressing IAV were unable to efficiently induce the robust inflammatory response as observed in wild-type mice. In addition to viral pore forming toxins, ion channel proteins and RNA, we demonstrate inducers of NLRP3-inflammasome activation may include disordered viral proteins, as exemplified by PB1-F2, acting as host pathogen 'danger' signals. Elucidating immunostimulatory PB1-F2 mediation of NLRP3-inflammasome activation is a major step forward in our understanding of the aetiology of disease attributable to exuberant inflammatory responses to IAV infection. © 2013 McAuley et al.",,134,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2013-05

Cholesterol crystals can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multimolecular signaling complex of the innate immune system, resulting in caspase-1 mediated activation and secretion of proinflammatory interleukin-1 family cytokines.

The high sensitivity, signal-to-background ratio and specificity of the iGLuc system renders it a useful tool to study proteolytic events in mouse and human cells at high throughput and to monitor protease activity in mice in vivo. © 2013 Nature America, Inc.

Deposition of amyloid-β peptide drives cerebral neuroinflammation by activating microglia. Indeed, amyloid-β activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia is fundamental for interleukin-1β maturation and subsequent inflammatory events. However, it remains unknown whether NLRP3 activation contributes to Alzheimer's disease in vivo. Here we demonstrate strongly enhanced active caspase-1 expression in human mild cognitive impairment and brains with Alzheimer's disease, suggesting a role for the inflammasome in this neurodegenerative disease. Nlrp3-/- or Casp1-/- mice carrying mutations associated with familial Alzheimer's disease were largely protected from loss of spatial memory and other sequelae associated with Alzheimer's disease, and demonstrated reduced brain caspase-1 and interleukin-1β activation as well as enhanced amyloid-β clearance. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome deficiency skewed microglial cells to an M2 phenotype and resulted in the decreased deposition of amyloid-β in the APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer's disease. These results show an important role for the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, and suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition represents a new therapeutic intervention for the disease. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Lysosomal degradation of engulfed material is a highly controlled mechanism, which is vital in the control of infection, recycling of cellular organelles, and the breakdown of larger material. Following ingestion, lysosomes acidify and mature, leading to the activation of a range of proteolytic enzymes. Lysosomes are considered stable organelles that separate their highly hydrolytic enzymes from the cytosol to prevent digestion of self-molecules and host cell damage. Some substances, mostly of a particulate or aggregated nature, are able to damage lysosomes. Lysosomal damage and rupture, with subsequent release of lysosomal content into the cytosol can have dramatic consequences for the cell, such as the induction of cell death or activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Fas signaling triggers apoptosis and induces inflammatory cytokine production. Among the Fasinduced cytokines, the IL-1β family cytokines require proteolysis to gain biological activity. Inflammasomes, which respond to pathogens and danger signals, cleave IL-1β cytokines via caspase-1. However, the mechanisms by which Fas regulates IL-1β activation remain unresolved. In this article, we demonstrate that macrophages exposed to TLR ligands upregulate Fas, which renders them responsive to receptor engagement by Fas ligand. Fas signaling activates caspase-8 in macrophages and dendritic cells, leading to the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18 independently of inflammasomes or RIP3. Hence, Fas controls a novel noncanonical IL-1β activation pathway in myeloid cells, which could play an essential role in inflammatory processes, tumor surveillance, and control of infectious diseases.

However, association of host DNA with autoantibodies activates TLR9, inducing the pathogenic secretion of type I interferons (IFNs) from plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Here, we found that in response to DNA-containing immune complexes (DNA-IC), but not to soluble ligands, IFN-α production depended upon the convergence of the phagocytic and autophagic pathways, a process called microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-associated phagocytosis (LAP). LAP was required for TLR9 trafficking into a specialized interferon signaling compartment by a mechanism that involved autophagy-related proteins, but not the conventional autophagic preinitiation complex, or adaptor protein-3 (AP-3). Our findings unveil a new role for nonconventional autophagy in inflammation and provide one mechanism by which anti-DNA autoantibodies, such as those found in several autoimmune disorders, bypass the controls that normally restrict the apportionment of pathogenic DNA and TLR9 to the interferon signaling compartment. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,233,1,NIAID,R01AI040646,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,0,2012-12

Their stimulation induces the activation of NF-κB, an important inducer of HIV-1 replication. In recent years, an increasing number of studies using several cells types from HIV-infected patients indicate that TLRs play a key role in regulating the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and viral pathogenesis. In the present study, the effect of HIV-1 stimulation of monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subpopulations from healthy donors on the expression and functions of TLR2 and TLR4 was examined. In addition, and to complete the in vitro study, the expression pattern of TLR2 and TLR4 in 49 HIV-1-infected patients, classified according to viral load and the use of HAART, was determined and compared with 25 healthy subjects. An increase of TLR expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines were observed in MDMs and PBMCs infected with HIV-1 in vitro and in response to TLR stimulation, compared to the mock. In addition, an association between TLR expression and up-regulation of CD80 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) was observed. The ex vivo analysis indicated increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), but only of TLR2 in monocytes obtained from HIV-1-infected patients, compared to healthy subjects. Remarkably, the expression was higher in cells from patients who do not use HAART. In monocytes, there was a positive correlation between both TLRs and viral load, but not CD4+ T cell numbers. Together, our in vitro and ex vivo results suggest that TLR expression and function can be up-regulated in response to HIV-1 infection and could affect the inflammatory response. We propose that modulation of TLRs represents a mechanism to promote HIV-1 replication or AIDS progression in HIV-1-infected patients. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,46,0,NHLBI,R01HL093262,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,2012-10

We sought to determine the uptake mechanism and the biological effect of EMP on endothelial and endothelial-regenerating cells. Methods and Results-EMP were generated from starved endothelial cells and isolated by ultracentrifugation. Caspase 3 activity assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay showed that EMP protect target endothelial cells against apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis was performed to identify molecules contained in EMP, which might be involved in EMP uptake. Expression of annexin I in EMP was found and confirmed by Western blot, whereas the corresponding receptor phosphatidylserine receptor was present on endothelial target cells. Silencing either annexin I on EMP or phosphatidylserine receptor on target cells using small interfering RNA showed that the uptake of EMP by human coronary artery endothelial cells is annexin I/phosphatidylserine receptor dependent. Annexin I-downregulated EMP abrogated the EMP-mediated protection against apoptosis of endothelial target cells. p38 activation was found to mediate camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Finally, human coronary artery endothelial cells pretreated with EMP inhibited camptothecin-induced p38 activation. Conclusion-EMP are incorporated by endothelial cells in an annexin I/phosphatidylserine receptor-dependent manner and protect target cells against apoptosis.

Flexible tethers were used between receptors and surface as well as between DNA and atomic force microscope tip to make efficient recognition studies possible. The molecular recognition forces detected are in the range of 50 to 150 ± 20 pN at the used force-loading rates, and the molecular interaction probability was much reduced when the receptors were blocked with free CpG-DNA. A linear increase of the unbinding force with the logarithm of the loading rate was found over the range 0.1 to 30 nN/s. This indicates a single potential barrier characterizing the energy landscape and no intermediate state for the unbinding pathway of CpG-DNA from the TLR9-ECD. Two important kinetic parameters for CpG-DNA interaction with TLR9-ECD were determined from the force-loading rate dependency: an off-rate of k off = 0.14 ± 0.10 s -1 and a binding interaction length of x β = 0.30 ± 0.03 nm, which are consistent with literature values. Various models for the molecular interaction of this innate immune receptor binding to CpG-DNA are discussed.

Array-based comparative genomic hybridization detected deletions involving KIAA1797 in around half of glioblastoma cell lines and glioblastomas investigated. Quantification of messenger RNA levels in human tissues demonstrated highest KIAA1797 expression in brain, reduced levels in all glioblastoma cell lines and most glioblastomas and similar levels in glial and neuronal cells by analysis of different hippocampal regions from murine brain. Antibodies against KIAA1797 were generated and showed similar protein levels in cortex and subcortical white matter of human brain, while levels were significantly reduced in glioblastomas with KIAA1797 deletion. By immunofluorescence of astrocytoma cells, KIAA1797 co-localized with vinculin in focal adhesions. Physical interaction between KIAA1797 and vinculin was demonstrated via co-immunoprecipitation. Functional in vitro assays demonstrated a significant decrease in colony formation, migration and invasion capacity of LN18 and U87MG glioma cells carrying a homozygous KIAA1797 deletion ectopically expressing KIAA1797 compared with mock-transduced cells. In an in vivo orthotopic xenograft mouse model, U87MG tumour lesions expressing KIAA1797 had a significantly reduced volume compared to tumours not expressing KIAA1797. In summary, the frequently deleted KIAA1797 gene encodes a novel focal adhesion complex protein with tumour suppressor function in gliomas, which we name 'focadhesin'.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in innate immunity against pathogens, but in HIV-1 patients coinfected with opportunistic infections, the regulation of TLR expression has not been studied. In this context, we have evaluated the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and myeloid dendritic cells of HIV-1 patients with or without opportunistic infections. Forty-nine HIV-1-infected individuals were classified according to viral load, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), and the presence or absence of opportunistic infections, and 21 healthy subjects served as controls. Increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was observed in myeloid dendritic cells of HIV-1 patients coinfected with opportunistic infections (without HAART), while TLR4 increased in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, compared to both HIV-1 without opportunistic infections and healthy subjects. Moreover, TLR2 expression was higher in patients with opportunistic infections without HAART and up-regulation of TLR expression in HIV-1 patients coinfected with opportunistic infections was more pronounced in dendritic cells derived from individuals coinfected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The results indicate that TLR expression in innate immune cells is up-regulated in patients with a high HIV-1 load and coinfected with opportunistic pathogens. We suggest that modulation of TLRs expression represents a mechanism that promotes HIV-1 replication and AIDS pathogenesis in patients coinfected with opportunistic pathogens. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,38,0,NHLBI,R01HL093262,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,2011-10

Exaggerated or uncontrolled immune responses, however, can also induce acute of chronic inflammatory pathologies that are characteristic for many common diseases such as sepsis, arthritis, atherosclerosis, or Alzheimer's disease. In recent years, the concerted efforts of many scientists have uncovered numerous mechanisms by which immune cells detect foreign or changed self-substances that appear in infections or during tissue damage. These substances stimulate signaling receptors, which leads to cellular activation and the induction of effector mechanisms.

This process is characterized by an increased local inflammatory and proliferative response that critically involves the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β). IL-1β is expressed and cytosolically retained as a procytokine that requires additional processing prior to exerting its pro-inflammatory function. Maturation and release of pro IL-1β is governed by a cytosolic protein scaffold that is known as the inflammasome. Here we show that NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pryin domain containing 3), an important activating component of the inflammasome, is involved in neointima formation after vascular injury. NLRP3 deficiency itself does not affect the functional cardiovascular phenotype and does not alter peripheral differential blood counts. However, neointima development following wire injury of the carotid artery was significantly decreased in NLRP3-deficient mice as compared to wild-type controls. In all, NLRP3 plays a non-redundant role in vascular damage mediated neointima formation. Our data establish NLRP3 as a key player in the response to vascular damage, which could open new avenues to therapeutic intervention. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Angioplasty | IL-1β | Inflammation | Restenosis,7,0,NHLBI,R01HL093262,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,2011-08

Previous studies have clearly shown the definitive role of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 in the development of atherosclerosis. Recent studies have provided direct evidence supporting a link between innate immunity and atherogenesis. Although it is still controversial about whether infectious pathogens contribute to cardiovascular diseases, direct genetic evidence indicates the importance of IL-1R/TLR signaling in atherogenesis. In this study, we examined the role of IL-1R - associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) kinase activity in modified low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-mediated signaling using bone marrow-derived macrophage as well as an in vivo model of atherosclerosis. First, we found that the IRAK4 kinase activity was required for modified LDL-induced NF-κB activation and expression of a subset of proinflammatory genes but not for the activation of MAPKs in bone marrow-derived macrophage. IRAK4 kinase-inactive knockin (IRAK4KI) mice were bred onto ApoE-/- mice to generate IRAK4KI/ApoE-/- mice. Importantly, the aortic sinus lesion formation was impaired in IRAK4KI/ApoE-/- mice compared with that in ApoE-/- mice. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokine production was reduced in the aortic sinus region of IRAK4KI/ApoE2/2 mice compared with that in ApoE-/- mice. Taken together, our results indicate that the IRAK4 kinase plays an important role in modified LDLmediated signaling and the development of atherosclerosis, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of IRAK4 kinase activity might be a feasible approach in the development of antiatherosclerosis drugs.

Inhibitory oligodeoxyribonucleotides (INH-ODN) have been developed that selectively block activation of mouse TLR9. Their inhibitory motif consisting of CCx(not-C)(not-C)xxGGG (x = any base) also reduces anti-DNA antibodies in lupus mice. The current study demonstrates that this motif also provides the sequences required to block TLR9 in human B cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transfected with human TLR9. However, extending the sequence by four to five bases at the 5' end enhanced activity and this enhancement was greater when a phosphorothioate (pS) backbone replaced the native phosphodiester (pO) backbone. A series of pO-backbone INH-ODN representing a 500-fold range of activity in biologic assays was shown to cover less than a 2.5-fold range of avidity for binding human TLR9-Ig fusion protein, eliminating TLR9 ectodomain binding as the explanation for sequence-specific differences in biologic activity. With few exceptions, the relative activity of INH-ODN in Namalwa cells and HEK/human TLR9 cells was similar to that seen in mouse B cells. INH-ODN activity in human peripheral blood B cells correlated significantly with the cell line data. These results favor the conclusion that although the backbone determines strength of TLR9 binding, critical recognition of the INH-ODN sequence necessary for biologic activity is performed by a molecule that is not TLR9. These studies also identify the strongest INH-ODN for human B cells, helping to guide the selection of INH-ODN sequences for therapeutics in any situation where inflammation is enhanced by TLR9. © The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2011.

STING, a critical mediator of IFN-β responses to DNA, was recruited to IFI16 after DNA stimulation.

We described a trafficking pathway for TLR4 from the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) to E. coli phagosomes. We found a prominent colocalization between TLR4 and the small GTPase Rab11a in the ERC, and Rab11a was involved in the recruitment of TLR4 to phagosomes in a process requiring TLR4 signaling. Also, Toll-receptor-associated molecule (TRAM) and interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3) localized to E. coli phagosomes and internalization of E. coli was required for a robust interferon-β induction. Suppression of Rab11a reduced TLR4 in the ERC and on phagosomes leading to inhibition of the IRF3 signaling pathway induced by E. coli, whereas activation of the transcription factor NF-κB was unaffected. Moreover, Rab11a silencing reduced the amount of TRAM on phagosomes. Thus, Rab11a is an important regulator of TLR4 and TRAM transport to E. coli phagosomes thereby controlling IRF3 activation from this compartment. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",,141,1,NHLBI,R01HL093262,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,2010-10

Recent studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the endotoxin receptor and its signaling system showed an association with the risk of disease development. This study aims to examine the response associated with genetic variations of TLR4, the receptor for bacterial LPS, and a central intracellular signal transducer (TIRAP/Mal) on cytokine release and for susceptibility and course of severe hospital acquired infections in distinct patient populations.Methods: Three intensive care units in tertiary care university hospitals in Greece and Germany participated. 375 and 415 postoperative patients and 159 patients with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) were included. TLR4 and TIRAP/Mal polymorphisms in 375 general surgical patients were associated with risk of infection, clinical course and outcome. In two prospective studies, 415 patients following cardiac surgery and 159 patients with newly diagnosed VAP predominantly caused by Gram-negative bacteria were studied for cytokine levels in-vivo and after ex-vivo monocyte stimulation and clinical course.Results: Patients simultaneously carrying polymorphisms in TIRAP/Mal and TLR4 and patients homozygous for the TIRAP/Mal SNP had a significantly higher risk of severe infections after surgery (odds ratio (OR) 5.5; confidence interval (CI): 1.34 - 22.64; P = 0.02 and OR: 7.3; CI: 1.89 - 28.50; P < 0.01 respectively). Additionally we found significantly lower circulating cytokine levels in double-mutant individuals with ventilator associated pneumonia and reduced cytokine production in an ex-vivo monocyte stimulation assay, but this difference was not apparent in TIRAP/Mal-homozygous patients. In cardiac surgery patients without infection, the cytokine release profiles were not changed when comparing different genotypes.Conclusions: Carriers of mutations in sequential components of the TLR signaling system may have an increased risk for severe infections. Patients with this genotype showed a decrease in cytokine release when infected which was not apparent in patients with sterile inflammation following cardiac surgery. © 2010 Kumpf et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,61,1,NWO,8-2,Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,papers by authors,0,2010-06

In this study, we have identified a novel alternatively spliced isoform of human MD-2, termed MD-2 short (MD-2s), which lacks the region encoded by exon 2 of the MD-2 gene. Similar to MD-2, MD-2s is glycosylated and secreted. MD-2s also interacted with LPS and TLR4, but failed to mediate LPS-induced NF-κB activation and IL-8 production. We show that MD-2s is upregulated upon IFN-γ, IL-6, and TLR4 stimulation and negatively regulates LPS-mediated TLR4 signaling. Furthermore, MD-2s competitively inhibited binding of MD-2 to TLR4. Our study pinpoints a mechanism that may be used to regulate TLR4 activation at the onset of signaling and identifies MD-2s as a potential therapeutic candidate to treat human diseases characterized by an overly exuberant or chronic immune response to LPS.

Activation of the inflammasome has been shown to play a critical role in the recognition and containment of various microbial pathogens, including the intracellularly replicating Listeria monocytogenes; however, the inflammasome pathways activated during L. monocytogenes infection are only poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that L. monocytogenes activates both the NLRP3 and the AIM2 inflammasome, with a predominant involvement of the AIM2 inflammasome. In addition, L. monocytogenes-triggered cell death was diminished in the absence of both AIM2 and NLRP3, and is concomitant with increased intracellular replication of L. monocytogenes.

Using Aim2-deficient mice, we identify a central role for AIM2 in regulating caspase-1-dependent maturation of IL-1Β and IL-18, as well as pyroptosis, in response to synthetic double-stranded DNA. AIM2 was essential for inflammasome activation in response to Francisella tularensis, vaccinia virus and mouse cytomegalovirus and had a partial role in the sensing of Listeria monocytogenes. Moreover, production of IL-18 and natural killer cell-dependent production of interferon-γ, events critical in the early control of virus replication, were dependent on AIM2 during mouse cytomegalovirus infection in vivo. Collectively, our observations demonstrate the importance of AIM2 in the sensing of both bacterial and viral pathogens and in triggering innate immunity. © 2010 Nature America, Inc.",,876,0,NIH,U54 AI-157168,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2010-05

Germ-free animals are susceptible to atherosclerosis, suggesting that endogenous substances initiate the inflammation. Mature atherosclerotic lesions contain macroscopic deposits of cholesterol crystals in the necrotic core, but their appearance late in atherogenesis had been thought to disqualify them as primary inflammatory stimuli. However, using a new microscopic technique, we revealed that minute cholesterol crystals are present in early diet-induced atherosclerotic lesions and that their appearance in mice coincides with the first appearance of inflammatory cells. Other crystalline substances can induce inflammation by stimulating the caspase-1-activating NLRP3 (NALP3 or cryopyrin) inflammasome, which results in cleavage and secretion of interleukin (IL)-1 family cytokines. Here we show that cholesterol crystals activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in phagocytes in vitro in a process that involves phagolysosomal damage. Similarly, when injected intraperitoneally, cholesterol crystals induce acute inflammation, which is impaired in mice deficient in components of the NLRP3 inflammasome, cathepsin B, cathepsin L or IL-1 molecules. Moreover, when mice deficient in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) were bone-marrow transplanted with NLRP3-deficient, ASC (also known as PYCARD)-deficient or IL-1α/Β-deficient bone marrow and fed on a high-cholesterol diet, they had markedly decreased early atherosclerosis and inflammasome-dependent IL-18 levels. Minimally modified LDL can lead to cholesterol crystallization concomitant with NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation in macrophages. Although there is the possibility that oxidized LDL activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in vivo, our results demonstrate that crystalline cholesterol acts as an endogenous danger signal and its deposition in arteries or elsewhere is an early cause rather than a late consequence of inflammation. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and indicate new potential molecular targets for the therapy of this disease. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

On the one hand, it plays a key role in initial host defense, particularly against many infections. On the other hand, its aim is imprecise, and as a consequence, when it is drawn into battle, it can cause collateral damage in tissues. In situations where the inciting stimulus is sterile, the cost-benefit ratio may be high; because of this, sterile inflammation underlies the pathogenesis of a number of diseases. Although there have been major advances in our understanding of how microbes trigger inflammation, much less has been learned about this process in sterile situations. This review focuses on a subset of the many sterile stimuli that can induce inflammation-specifically dead cells and a variety of irritant particles, including crystals, minerals, and protein aggregates. Although this subset of stimuli is structurally very diverse and might appear to be unrelated, there is accumulating evidence that the innate immune system may recognize them in similar ways and stimulate the sterile inflammatory response via common pathways. Here we review established and emerging data about these responses. Copyright © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

In spite of the importance of innate immunity in controlling microbial infections, almost nothing is known about its role during the liver stage of a malaria infection. Here, we tested whether synthetic CpG phosphothioate (PS) oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), which bind to Toll-like receptor 9 (Tlr9), could have a protective effect on Plasmodium berghei infection in hepatocytes. Surprisingly, CpG PS-ODNs potently impair P. berghei infection in hepatoma cell lines independently of Tlr9 activation. Indeed, not only CpG but also non-CpG PS-ODNs, which do not activate Tlr9, decreased parasite infection. Moreover, the ability of PS-ODNs to impair infection was not due to an effect on the host but rather on the parasite itself. In fact, CpG PS-ODNs, as well as non-CpG PS-ODNs, impair parasite gliding motility. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that PS-ODNs inhibit parasite migration and invasion due to their negative charge, whereas development inside hepatocytes is undisturbed. Altogether, PS-ODNs might represent a new class of prophylactic antimalaria agents, which hamper hepatocyte entry by Plasmodium sporozoites. © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,9,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2010-04

However, it is now well established that siRNAs, depending on their sequence, can be variably sensed by the innate immune system through recruitment of toll-like receptors 7 and 8 (TLR7/8). Here, we aimed to identify sequence-based modifications allowing for the design of bifunctional siRNAs with both proinflammatory and specific silencing activities, and with potentially increased therapeutic benefits. We found that the introduction of a micro-RNA (miRNA)-like nonpairing uridine-bulge in the passenger strand robustly increased immunostimulatory activity on human immune cells. This sequence modification had no effect on the silencing efficiency of the siRNA. Increased immunostimulation with the uridine-bulge design was specific to human cells, and conserved silencing efficiency required a Dicer-substrate scaffold. The increased cytokine production with the uridine-bulge design resulted in enhanced protection against Semliki Forest virus (SFV) infection, in viral assays. Thus, we characterize a design scaffold applicable to any given siRNA sequence, that results in increased innate immune activation without affecting gene silencing. Our data suggest that this sequence modification coupled with structural modification differentially recruits human TLR8 over TLR7, and could have potential application in antiviral therapies. © The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.",,52,1,NHMRC,491106,National Health and Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2010-04

In response to a variety of microbial components and crystalline substances, both cytokines are processed via the caspase-1-activating multiprotein complex, the NLRP3 inflammasome. Here, the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in experimental colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was examined. Methods: IL-1β production in response to DSS was studied in macrophages of wild-type, caspase-1-/-, NLRP3-/-, ASC -/-, cathepsin B-/- or cathepsin L-/- mice. Colitis was induced in C57BL/6 and NLRP3-/- mice by oral DSS administration. A clinical disease activity score was evaluated daily. Histological colitis severity and expression of cytokines were determined in colonic tissue. Results: Macrophages incubated with DSS in vitro secreted high levels of IL-1β in a caspase-1-dependent manner. IL-1β secretion was abrogated in macrophages lacking NLRP3, ASC or caspase-1, indicating that DSS activates caspase-1 via the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, IL-1β secretion was dependent on phagocytosis, lysosomal maturation, cathepsin B and L, and reactive oxygen species (ROS). After oral administration of DSS, NLRP3 -/- mice developed a less severe colitis than wild-type mice and produced lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines in colonic tissue. Pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 with pralnacasan achieved a level of mucosal protection comparable with NLRP3 deficiency. Conclusions: The NLRP3 inflammasome was identified as a critical mechanism of intestinal inflammation in the DSS colitis model. The NLRP3 inflammasome may serve as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutics for patients with IBD.",,448,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2010-01

The most proximal events that initiate signal transduction frequently are receptor dimerization or conformational changes in receptor complexes. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane receptors that are activated by a number of exogenous and endogenous ligands. Most TLRs can respond to multiple ligands and the different TLRs recognize structurally diverse molecules ranging from proteins, sugars, lipids, and nucleic acids. TLRs can be expressed on the plasma membrane or in endosomal compartments, and ligand recognition thus proceeds in different microenvironments. Not surprisingly, distinctive mechanisms of TLR receptor activation have evolved. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms of TLR activation is important for the development of novel synthetic TLR activators or pharmacological inhibitors of TLRs. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM) combined with green fluorescent protein (GFP) technology allows the direct visualization of TLR expression in living cells. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements between two differentially tagged proteins permit the study of TLR interaction and distances between receptors in the range of molecular interactions can be measured and visualized. Additionally, FRET measurements combined with confocal microscopy provide detailed information about molecular interactions in different subcellular localizations. Bimolecular complementation using split fluorescent proteins (BiFC) represents an additional valuable method to study mechanisms of receptor activation in living cells. These techniques permit the dynamic visualization of early signaling events in living cells and can be utilized in pharmacological or genetic screens. © 2009 Humana Press, a part of Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). | Confocal microscopy | Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) | Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) | GFP fragment reconstitution | Laser scanning microscopy (LSM) | Protein fragment reconstitution (PCA) | Toll-like receptor (TLR),5,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2009-12

A class (CpG-A) and B class (CpG-B) oligonucleotides display distinct physical properties. CpG-A, but not CpG-B, can multimerize to form exceedingly large lattices. CpG-A cannot effectively activate B cells but does induce plasmacytoid dendritic cells to produce high levels of IFNα, while CpG-B is a potent B cell mitogen. In this study, we report that CpG-A is internalized by B cells, and CpG-A and CpG-B accumulate in distinct intracellular compartments. When present in the form of an immune complex (CpG-A IC), CpG-A is taken up more efficiently by AM14 IgG2a-specific B cells, and elicits a robust TLR9-dependent B cell proliferative response. B cells proliferating comparably and in a TLR9-dependent fashion in response to CpG-A IC and CpG-B exhibited distinct cytokine profiles. CpG-A IC induced enhanced production of RANTES and markedly reduced levels of IL-6 when compared with CpG-B. We also found that engagement of the AM14 BCR by a protein IC, which cannot by itself induce proliferation, promoted TLR9-dependent but BCR-independent proliferation by bystander CpG-A or fragments of mammalian dsDNA. These data identify direct and indirect mechanisms by which BCR engagement facilitates access of exogenous ligands to TLR9-associated compartments and subsequent B cell activation.

Receptor dimerization is coupled to downstream signal transduction by the recruitment of a post-receptor complex containing the adaptor protein MyD88 and the IRAK protein kinases. In this work, we show that the death domains of human MyD88 and IRAK-4 assemble into closed complexes having unusual stoichiometries of 7:4 and 8:4, the Myddosome. Formation of the Myddosome is likely to be a key event for TLR4 signaling in vivo as we show here that pathway activation requires that the receptors cluster into lipid rafts.

The cytosolic helicase RIG-I is a key sensor of viral infections and is activated by RNA containing a triphosphate at the 5′ end. The exact structure of RNA activating RIG-I remains controversial. Here, we established a chemical approach for 5′ triphosphate oligoribonucleotide synthesis and found that synthetic single-stranded 5′ triphosphate oligoribonucleotides were unable to bind and activate RIG-I. Conversely, the addition of the synthetic complementary strand resulted in optimal binding and activation of RIG-I. Short double-strand conformation with base pairing of the nucleoside carrying the 5′ triphosphate was required. RIG-I activation was impaired by a 3′ overhang at the 5′ triphosphate end. These results define the structure of RNA for full RIG-I activation and explain how RIG-I detects negative-strand RNA viruses that lack long double-stranded RNA but do contain blunt short double-stranded 5′ triphosphate RNA in the panhandle region of their single-stranded genome. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

RNA is sensed by Toll-like receptor members TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8, or by the RNA helicases RIG-I (also known as DDX58) and MDA-5 (IFIH1). Little is known about sensors for cytoplasmic DNA that trigger antiviral and/or inflammatory responses. The best characterized of these responses involves activation of the TANK-binding kinase (TBK1)-interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) signalling axis to trigger transcriptional induction of type I interferon genes. A second, less well-defined pathway leads to the activation of an inflammasome that, via caspase-1, controls the catalytic cleavage of the pro-forms of the cytokines IL1Β and IL18 (refs 6, 7). Using mouse and human cells, here we identify the PYHIN (pyrin and HIN domain-containing protein) family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) as a receptor for cytosolic DNA, which regulates caspase-1. The HIN200 domain of AIM2 binds to DNA, whereas the pyrin domain (but not that of the other PYHIN family members) associates with the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain) to activate both NF-B and caspase-1. Knockdown of Aim2 abrogates caspase-1 activation in response to cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA and the double-stranded DNA vaccinia virus. Collectively, these observations identify AIM2 as a new receptor for cytoplasmic DNA, which forms an inflammasome with the ligand and ASC to activate caspase-1. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

In assessing IFN production in response to group B streptococcus (GBS), we find that IFN-β was produced by macrophages upon stimulation with both heat-killed and live GBS. Exposure of macrophages to heat-killed GBS activated a Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent pathway, whereas live GBS activated a TLR/NOD/RIG-like receptor (RLR)-independent pathway. This latter pathway required bacterial phagocytosis, proteolytic bacterial degradation, and phagolysosomal membrane destruction by GBS pore-forming toxins, leading to the release of bacterial DNA into the cytosol. GBS DNA in the cytosol induced IFN-β production via a pathway dependent on the activation of the serine-threonine kinase TBK1 and phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3. Thus, activation of IFN-α/-β production during infection with GBS, commonly considered an extracellular pathogen, appears to result from the interaction of GBS DNA with a putative intracellular DNA sensor or receptor. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In silico wide analysis associated with in vitro screening of synthetic oligonucleotides demonstrates that the retrotransposon VIPER elements and mucin-like glycoprotein (TcMUC) genes in the T. cruzi genome are highly enriched for CpG motifs that are immunostimulatory for mouse and human TLR9, respectively. Importantly, infection with T. cruzi triggers high levels of luciferase activity under NF-κB-dependent transcription in HEK cells cotransfected with human TLR9, but not in control (cotransfected with human MD2/TLR4) HEK cells. Further, we observed translocation of TLR9 to the lysosomes during invasion/uptake of T. cruzi parasites by dendritic cells. Consistently, potent proinflammatory activity was observed when highly unmethylated T. cruzi genomic DNA was delivered to the endo-lysosomal compartment of host cells expressing TLR9. Thus, together our results indicate that the unmethylated CpG motifs found in the T. cruzi genome are likely to be main parasite targets and probably become available to TLR9 when parasites are destroyed in the lysosome-fused vacuoles during parasite invasion/uptake by phagocytes. © 2008 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.",,54,1,NIAID,R01AI071319,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,0,2008-07

ABCA1 activity is regulated both at the transcriptional level and at the post-translational level. To explore mechanisms involved in the post-translational regulation of the transporter, we have used affinity purification and mass spectrometry to identify proteins that bind ABCA1 and influence its activity. Previously, we demonstrated that an interaction between β1-syntrophin stimulated ABCA1 activity, at least in part, be slowing the degradation of the transporter. This work demonstrates that one subunit of the serine palmitoyltransferase enzyme, SPTLC1, but not subunit 2 (SPTLC2), is copurified with ABCA1 and negatively regulates its function. In human THP-I macrophages and in mouse liver, the ABCA1-SPTLC1 complex was detected by co-immunoprecipitation, demonstrating that the interaction occurs in cellular settings where ABCA1 activity is critical for HDL genesis. Pharmacologic inhibition of SPTLC1 with myriocin, which resulted in the disruption of the SPTLC1-ABCA1 complex, and siRNA knockdown of SPTLC1 expression both stimulated ABCA1 efflux by nearly 60% (p < 0.05). In contrast, dominant-negative mutants of SPTLC1 inhibited ABCA1 efflux, indicating that a reduced level of sphingomyelin synthesis could not explain the effect of myriocin on ABCA1 activity. In 293 cells, the SPTLC1 inhibition of ABCA1 activity led to the blockade of the exit of ABCA1 from the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast, myriocin treatment of macrophages increased the level of cell surface ABCA1. In composite, these results indicate that the physical interaction of ABCA1 and SPTLC1 results in reduction of ABCA1 activity and that inhibition of this interaction produces enhanced cholesterol efflux. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,38,0,NHLBI,R01HL074136,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,2008-06

Here, we showed that the sugar backbone determined DNA recognition by TLR9. Homopolymeric, base-free PD 2′ deoxyribose acted as a basal TLR9 agonist as it bound to and activated TLR9. This effect was enhanced by DNA bases, even short of CpG motifs. In contrast, PS-modified 2′ deoxyribose homopolymers acted as TLR9 and TLR7 antagonists. They displayed high affinity to both TLRs and did not activate on their own, but they competitively inhibited ligand-TLR interaction and activation. Although addition of random DNA bases to the PS 2′ deoxyribose backbone did not alter these effects, CpG motifs transformed TLR9-inhibitory to robust TLR9-stimulatory activity. Our results identified the PD 2′ deoxyribose backbone as an important determinant of TLR9 activation by natural DNA, restrict CpG-motif dependency of TLR9 activation to synthetic PS-modified ligands, and define PS-modified 2′ deoxyribose as a prime effector of TLR9 and TLR7 inhibition. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, cathepsin K-/- mice were resistant to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Pharmacological inhibition or targeted disruption of cathepsin K resulted in defective Toll-like receptor 9 signaling in dendritic cells in response to unmethylated CpG DNA, which in turn led to attenuated induction of T helper 17 cells, without affecting the antigen-presenting ability of dendritic cells.

HZ has been reported to induce inflammation by directly engaging Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9, an endosomal receptor. ""Synthetic"" HZ (β-hematin), typically generated from partially purified extracts of bovine hemin, is structurally identical to natural HZ. When HPLC-purified hemin was used to synthesize the crystal, β-hematin had no inflammatory activity. In contrast, natural HZ from Plasmodium falciparum cultures was a potent TLR9 inducer. Natural HZ bound recombinant TLR9 ectodomain, but not TLR2. Both TLR9 stimulation and TLR9 binding of HZ were abolished by nuclease treatment. PCR analysis demonstrated that natural HZ is coated with malarial but not human DNA. Purified malarial DNA activated TLR9 but only when DNA was targeted directly to the endosome with a transfection reagent. Stimulatory quantities of natural HZ contain < 1 μg of malarial DNA; its potency in activating immune responses was even greater than transfecting malarial DNA. Thus, although the malarial genome is extremely AT-rich, its DNA is highly proinflammatory, with the potential to induce cytokinemia and fever during disease.

TLR7 expression and signaling have been demonstrated in plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells. The regulation of TLR7 signaling can play a crucial role in shaping the immune response to RNA viruses with different cellular tropisms, and in developing adjuvants capable of promoting balanced humoral and cell-mediated immunity. We used unique characteristics of two ssRNA viruses, dengue virus and influenza virus, to delineate factors that regulate viral RNA-human TLR7 signaling beyond recognition in endosomal compartments. Our data show that TLR7 recognition of enveloped RNA virus genomes is linked to virus fusion or uncoating from the endosome. The signaling threshold required to activate TLR7-type I IFN production is greater than that required to activate TLR7-NF-κB-IL-8 production. The higher order structure of viral RNA appears to be an important determinant of TLR7-signaling potency. A greater understanding of viral RNA-TLR7 activity relationships will promote rational approaches to interventional and vaccine strategies for important human viral pathogens.

The delayed kinetics of HMGB1 release makes it an attractive therapeutic target with a wider window of opportunity for the treatment of lethal systemic inflammation. However, the receptor(s) responsible for HMGB1-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines has not been well characterized. Here we demonstrate that in human whole blood, neutralizing antibodies against Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4, but not TLR2 or receptor for advanced glycation end product) dose-dependently attenuate HMGB1-induced IL-8 release. Similarly, in primary human macrophages, HMGB1-induced TNF release is dose-dependently inhibited by anti-TLR4 antibodies. In primary macrophages from knockout mice, HMGB1 activates significantly less TNF release in cells obtained from MyD88 and TLR4 knockout mice as compared with cells from TLR2 knockout and wild-type controls. However, in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with TLR2 or TLR4, HMGB1 effectively induces IL-8 release only from TLR2 overexpressing cells. Consistently, anti-TLR2 antibodies dose-dependently attenuate HMGB1-induced IL-8 release in human embryonic kidney/TLR2-expressing cells and markedly reduce HMGB1 cell surface binding on murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells. Taken together, our data suggest that there is a differential usage of TLR2 and TLR4 in HMGB1 signaling in primary cells and in established cell lines, adding complexity to studies of HMGB1 signaling which was not previously expected.

TRAM functions exclusively in the TLR4 pathway. Here we show by confocal microscopy that TRAM is localized in the plasma membrane and the Golgi apparatus, where it colocalizes with TLR4. Membrane localization of TRAM is the result of myristoylation because mutation of a predicted myristoylation site in TRAM (TRAM-G2A) brought about dissociation of TRAM from the membrane and its relocation to the cytosol. Further, TRAM, but not TRAM-G2A, was radiolabeled with [3H]myristate in vivo. Unlike wild-type TRAM, overexpression of TRAM-G2A failed to elicit either IFW regulatory factor 3 or NF-κB signaling. Moreover, TRAM-G2A was unable to reconstitute LPS responses in bone marrow-derived macrophages from TRAM-deficient mice. These observations provide clear evidence that the myristoylation of TRAM targets it to the plasma membrane, where it is essential for LPS responses through the TLR4 signal transduction pathway, and suggest a hitherto unappreciated manner in which LPS responses can be regulated. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Innate immunity | Lipopolysaccharide,197,1,MRC,G0400007,Medical Research Council,papers by authors,0,2006-04

Protective T cell responses to the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans are dependent on heavily mannosylated Ags termed mannoproteins. In the work presented, the innate immune response to mannoprotein was determined. Purified murine splenic dendritic cells (DC), B cells, and macrophages were used to stimulate mannoprotein-specific T cells. Only DC were capable of any measurable stimulation. Depletion of DC resulted in the abrogation of the T cell response. Human and murine DC rapidly captured fluorescent-labeled mannoprotein by a mannose receptor-mediated process. Using transfected cell lines, the type II C-type lectin receptor DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (CD209) was determined to have affinity for mannoprotein. Taken together with prior work demonstrating that mannoprotein was captured by the macrophage mannose receptor (CD206), these data suggest that multiple mannose receptors on DC recognize mannoprotein. Pulsing experiments demonstrated that DC captured sufficient mannoprotein over 2 h to account for 50% of total stimulation. Capture appeared dependent on mannose receptors, as competitive mannosylated inhibitors and calcium chelators each interfered with T cell stimulation. By confocal microscopy, intracellular mannoprotein trafficked to an endo-lysosomal compartment in DC, and at later time points extended into tubules in a similar fashion to the degradation marker DQ-OVA. Mannoprotein colocalized intracellularly with CD206 and CD209. These data suggest that DC provide the crucial link between innate and adaptive immune responses to C. neoformans via a process that is dependent upon the efficient uptake of mannoprotein by mannose receptors.

LPS was endocytosed by a receptor-mediated mechanism dependent on dynamin and clathrin and colocalized with TLR4 on early/sorting endosomes. TLR4 was ubiquitinated and associated with the ubiquitin-binding endosomal sorting protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate, Hrs. Inhibition of endocytosis and endosomal sorting increased LPS signaling. Finally, the LPS receptor complex was sorted to late endosomes/lysosomes for degradation and loading of associated antigens onto HLA class II molecules for presentation to CD4+ T cells.

TLR9 is intracellularly expressed in the endo-lysosomal compartments of specialized immune cells. TLR9 is activated in response to DNA, in particular DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs that are more prevalent in microbial than mammalian DNA. By detecting foreign DNA signatures TLR9 can sense the presence of certain viruses or bacteria inside the cell and mount an immune response. However, under certain conditions, TLR9 can also recognize self-DNA and this may promote immune pathologies with uncontrolled chronic inflammation. The autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) is characterized by the presence of immune stimulatory complexes containing autoantibodies against endogenous DNA and DNA- and RNA-associated proteins. Recent evidence indicates that the autoimmune response to these complexes involves TLR9 and the related single-stranded RNA-responsive TLRs 7 and 8, and therefore some breakdown in the normal ability of these TLRs to distinguish self and foreign DNA. Evidence suggests that immune cells use several mechanisms to discriminate between stimulatory and nonstimulatory DNA; however, it appears that TLR9 itself binds rather indiscriminately to a broad range of DNAs. We therefore propose that there is an additional recognition step by which TLR9 senses differences in the structures of bound DNA. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.",B cell | B cell receptor | CD80 | CD86 | Fc receptor | Innate immune system | Innate immunity | Interferon (IFN) | ODN | Oligonucleotides (ODN) | Plasmacytpoid dendritic cell (pDC) | Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) | TLR7 | TLR9 | Toll-like receptor (TLR),73,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2006-01

While B. bronchiseptica has a wide host range, B. pertussis and B. parapertussis evolved separately from a B. bronchiseptica-like progenitor to naturally infect only humans. Despite very different doubling times in vitro, all three establish similar levels of infection in the mouse lung within 72 h. Recent work has revealed separate roles for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in immunity to B. pertussis and B. bronchiseptica, while no role for TLR4 during B. parapertussis infection has been described. Here we compared the requirement for TLR4 in innate host defense to these organisms using the same mouse infection model. While B. bronchiseptica causes lethal disease in TLR4-deficient mice, B. pertussis and B. parapertussis do not. Correspondingly, TLR4 is critical in limiting B. bronchiseptica but not B. pertussis or B. parapertussis bacterial numbers during the first 72 h. Interestingly, B. bronchiseptica induces a TLR4-dependent cytokine response that is considerably larger than that induced by B. pertussis or B. parapertussis. Analysis of their endotoxins using RAW cells suggests that B. bronchiseptica lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is 10- and 100-fold more stimulatory than B. pertussis or B. parapertussis LPS, respectively. The difference in LPS stimulus is more pronounced when using HEK293 cells expressing human TLR4. Thus, it appears that in adapting to infect humans, B. pertussis and B. parapertussis independently modified their LPS to reduce TLR4-mediated responses, which may compensate for slower growth rates and facilitate host colonization.

TLR4 is the signal transduction component of the LPS receptor, whereas MD-2 is the endotoxin-binding unit. MD-2 appears to activate TLR4 when bound to TLR4 and ligated by LPS. Only the monomeric form of MD-2 was found to bind LPS and only monomeric MD-2 interacts with TLR4. Monomeric MD-2 binds TLR4 with an apparent Kd of 12 nM; this binding avidity was unaltered in the presence of endotoxin. E5564, an LPS antagonist, appears to inhibit cellular activation by competitively preventing the binding of LPS to MD-2. Depletion of endogenous soluble MD-2 from human serum, with an immobilized TLR4 fusion protein, abrogated TLR4-mediated LPS responses. By determining the concentration of added-back MD-2 that restored normal LPS responsiveness, the concentration of MD-2 was estimated to be ∼50 nM. Similarly, purified TLR4-Fc fusion protein, when added to the supernatants of TLR4-expressing cells in culture, inhibited the interaction of MD-2 with TLR4, thus preventing LPS stimulation. The ability to inhibit the effects of LPS as a result of the binding of TLR4-Fc or E5564 to MD-2 highlights MD-2 as the logical target for drug therapies designed to pharmacologically intervene against endotoxin-induced disease.

In stimulated cells, TLR9 translocated to CpG-DNA or microbial DNA containing structures in the endosome, where TLR9 binds to DNA and initiates signaling. © W. S.

In vivo, the TLRs mediate the innate immune response by serving as pathogen recognition receptors, whose oligomerized intracellular Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domains can initiate innate immune signaling. A family of TIR domain-containing adapter molecules transduces signals from engaged receptors that ultimately activate NF-κB and/or interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to induce proinflammatory cytokines. Data base searches detected a significant similarity between the N1L protein of vaccinia virus and A52R, a poxvirus inhibitor of TIR signaling. Compared with other poxvirus virulence factors, the poxvirus N1L protein strongly affects virulence in vivo; however, the precise target of N1L was previously unknown. Here we show that N1L suppresses NF-κB activation following engagement of Toll/IL-1 receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptors, and lymphotoxin receptors. N1L inhibited receptor-, adapter-, TRAF-, and IKK-α and IKK-β-dependent signaling to NF-κB. N1L associated with several components of the multisubunit I-κB kinase complex, most strongly associating with the kinase, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). Together these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that N1L disrupts signaling to NF-κB by Toll/IL-1Rs and TNF superfamily receptors by targeting the IKK complex for inhibition. Furthermore, N1L inhibited IRF3 signaling, which is also regulated by TBK1. These studies define a role for N1L as an immunomodulator of innate immunity by targeting components of NF-κB and IRF3 signaling pathways.",,200,1,NIAID,U19AI057319,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,0,2004-08

Hib-meningococcal outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) conjugate vaccine, however, elicits protective anti-PS Ab titers after one dose. We found that OMPC and Hib-OMPC engaged human Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, inducing IL-8 production, and engaged mouse TLR2 on bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, inducing TNF release. Hib conjugated to the carrier proteins CRM197 and tetanus toxoid did not engage TLR2 on HEK or dendritic cells. Engagement of TLR2 by Hib-OMPC was MyD88 dependent, as Hib-OMPC-induced TNF production was ablated in MyD88 knockout (KO) mice. Hib-OMPC was significantly less immunogenic in TLR2 KO mice, inducing lower Hib PS IgG and IgM titers compared with those in wild-type mice. Splenocytes from OMPC-immunized TLR2 KO mice also produced significantly less IL-6 and TNF-α than those from wild-type mice. Hib-OMPC is unique among glycoconjugate vaccines by engaging TLR2, and the ability of Hib-OMPC to elicit protective levels of Abs after one dose may be related to TLR2-mediated induction and regulation of cytokines produced by T cells and macrophages in addition to the peptide/MHC II-dependent recruitment of T cell help commonly afforded by carrier proteins.

Pentoxifyllin (PTX) produced a beneficial effect on cytokine response and survival in animal experiments of septic shock, and we were interested to explore its effect during TNF-ILP in humans. Methods: Eighteen consecutive patients underwent TNF-ILP and received PTX (30 mg/kg/day), whereas another 13 consecutive patients did not. PTX was given systemically after the limb extracorporeal circulation was started. Cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and pulmonary vascular resistance were recorded via a Swan-Ganz catheter. Blood levels of TNF-α, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein were determined before, during, and after ILP. Results: After reperfusion, systemic levels of TNF-α were significantly less increased in the PTX group (peak, 2.8 vs. 1.3 ng/mL; P < .05), as were interleukin-6 values (peak, 68 vs. 22 pg/mL; P < .02) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein plasma levels (peak, 215 vs. 105 μg/mL; P < .03). Differences in cardiac index, SVR, and mean arterial blood pressure were not significantly different. Norepinephrine or dobutamine to maintain SVR was less required in the PTX group. Conclusions: PTX attenuates systemic cytokine production and influences components of the systemic inflammatory response after TNF-ILP. PTX may play a beneficial role in the management of septic shock-like syndrome, particularly in patients with leakage from the ILP circuit. © 2003 The Society of Surgical Oncology, Inc.",Cytokine | Isolated limb perfusion | Pentoxifyllin | Septic shock | SIRS | TNF-α,16,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2003-12

These studies clarify how MD-2 functions: we found that MD-2 enables TLR4 binding to LPS and allows the formation of stable receptor complexes. MD-2 must be bound to TLR4 on the cell surface before binding can occur. Consequently, TLR4 clusters into receptosomes (many of which are massive) that recruit intracellular toll/IL-1/resistance domain-containing adapter proteins within minutes, thus initiating signal transduction.

These findings suggest that a membrane receptor recognizes a CMV envelope protein(s), leading to innate immune activation. Here, we show that the pattern recognition receptors Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and CD14 recognize CMV virions and trigger inflammatory cytokine production.

By transiently transfecting HEK293 cells, we found that membrane CD14 together with either TLR2 or TLR4/MD-2 could mediate activation by poly-M. Transfection of HEK293 cells with TLR2 and fluorescently labeled TLR4 followed by co-patching of TLR2 with an antibody revealed no association of these molecules on the plasma membrane. However, macrophages from the Tlr4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice and TLR4 knockout mice were completely non-responsive to poly-M, whereas the tumor necrosis factor release from TLR2 knockout macrophages was half of that seen with wild type cells.

We reported previously two complementation groups of mutant cell lines derived from CD14-transfected Chinese hamster ovary-K1 fibroblasts defective in responses to bacterial endotoxin. Both classes of mutants expressed a normal gene product for Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, and fully responded to stimulation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or interleukin (IL)-1β. We identified the lesion in one of the complementation groups in the gene for MD-2, a putative TLR4 coreceptor. The nonresponder phenotype of this mutant was reversed by transfection with MD-2. Cloning of MD-2 from the nonresponder cell line revealed a point mutation in a highly conserved region resulting in a C95Y amino acid exchange. Both forms of MD-2 colocalized with TLR4 on the cell surface after transfection, but only the wild-type cDNA reverted the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) nonresponder phenotype. Furthermore, soluble MD-2, but not soluble MD-2C95Y, functioned to enable LPS responses in cells that expressed TLR4. Thus, MD-2 is a required component of the LPS signaling complex and can function as a soluble receptor for cells that do not otherwise express it.

To fully establish the kinetic properties of this enzyme, we studied the interaction of Mtb NDH-2 with substrates, NADH, and various quinone analogues and their products in both membrane and soluble environments. These studies, and comparative analyses of the kinetics with thio-NAD+ and quinone electron acceptors, provided evidence that Mtb NDH-2 catalyzes the transfer electrons from NADH to quinone substrates by a nonclassical, two-site ping-pong kinetic mechanism whereby substrate quinones bind to a site that is distinct from the NADH-binding site. Furthermore, the effects of quinols on Mtb NDH-2 catalytic activity demonstrate the presence of two binding sites for quinone ligands, one favoring the reduced form and the other favoring the oxidized form. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,24,1,NIAID,R01 AI068942,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,0,2014-02

This approach allowed us to verify the involvement of the Tcl1/Akt/mTOR biochemical pathway in the disease by testing the ability of a specific pharmacologic agent, rapamycin, to slow CLL. We also showed that 36% of these transgenic mice were affected by solid malignancies, in which the expression of the Tcl1 protein was absent. These findings indicate that other oncogenic mechanism(s) may be involved in the development of solid tumors in Eμ-TCL1 transgenic mice. ©2006 American Association for Cancer Research.",,58,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2006-01

Here we present a new, comprehensive, and quantitative model for allosteric control of mRR enzymatic activity based on molecular mass, ligand binding, and enzyme activity studies. In this model, nucleotide binding to the specificity site (s-site) drives formation of an active R12R22 dimer, ATP or dATP binding to the adenine-specific site (a-site) results in formation of an inactive tetramer, and ATP binding to the newly described hexamerization site (h-site) drives formation of active R16R26 hexamer. In contrast, an earlier phenomenological model [Thelander, L., and Reichard, P. (1979) Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67, 71-98] (the ""RT"" model) ignores aggregation state changes and mistakenly rationalizes ATP activation versus dATP inhibition as reflecting different functional consequences of ATP versus dATP binding to the a-site. Our results suggest that the R16R26 heterohexamer is the major active form of the enzyme in mammalian cells, and that the ATP concentration is the primary modulator of enzyme activity, coupling the rate of DNA biosynthesis with the energetic state of the cell. Using the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli R1 hexamer as a model for the mR1 hexamer, a scheme is presented that rationalizes the slow isomerization of the tetramer form and suggests an explanation for the low enzymatic activity of tetramers complexed with R2. The similar specific activities of R12R22 and R16R26 are inconsistent with a proposed model for R22 docking with R12 [Uhlin, U., and Eklund, H. (1994) Nature 370, 533-539], and an alternative is suggested.",,95,0,NCI,R01CA058567,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,2002-01

Synthetic methods focus on the production of small molecules that must traverse the cell membrane to elicit a response. Genetic methods enable intracellular ligand production, but products must typically be large molecules in order to withstand cellular catabolism. Here we describe an intein-based approach to biosynthesis of backbone cyclic peptide libraries that combines the strengths of synthetic and genetic methods. Results: Through site-directed mutagenesis we show that the DnaE intein from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is very promiscuous with respect to peptide substrate composition, and can generate cyclic products ranging from four to nine amino acids. Libraries with five variable amino acids and either one or four fixed residues were prepared, yielding between 107 and 108 transformants. The majority of randomly selected clones from each library gave cyclic products. Conclusions: We have developed a versatile method for producing intracellular libraries of small, stable cyclic peptides. Genetic encoding enables facile manipulation of vast numbers of compounds, while low molecular weight ensures ready pharmacophore identification. The demonstrated flexibility of the method towards both peptide length and composition makes it a valuable addition to existing methods for generating ligand diversity. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A quantitative 16 species model is presented, in which all pertinent equilibrium constants are evaluated, that accounts for the effects of the purine substrates ADP and GDP, the deoxynucleoside triphosphate allosteric effectors dGTP and dTTP, and the dimeric murine R2 subunit on both the quaternary structure of murine R1 subunit and the dependence of holoenzyme (R12R22) activity on substrate and effector concentrations. R1, monomeric in the absence of ligands, dimerizes in the presence of substrate, effectors, or R22 because each of these ligands binds R12 with higher affinity than R1 monomer. This leads to apparent positive heterotropic cooperativity between substrate and allosteric effector binding that is not observed when binding to the dimeric protein itself is evaluated. Allosteric activation results from an increase in kcat for substrate reduction upon binding of the correct effector, rather than from heterotropic cooperativity between effector and substrate. Neither the allosteric site nor the active site displays nucleotide base specificity: dissociation constants for dGTP and dTTP are nearly equivalent and Km and kcat values for both ADP and GDP are similar. R22 binding to R12 shows negative heterotropic cooperativity vis-à-vis effectors but positive heterotropic cooperativity vis-à-vis substrates. Binding of allosteric effectors to the holoenzyme shows homotropic cooperativity, suggestive of a conformational change induced by activator binding.

Cytomegaloviruses encode several distinct suppressors that block intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, and necroptosis, pathways that impact pathogenesis of this ubiquitous herpesvirus. Here, we expanded the understanding of three cell autonomous suppression mechanisms on which murine cytomegalovirus relies: (i) M38.5-encoded viral mitochon-drial inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA), a BAX suppressor that functions in concert with M41.1-encoded viral inhibitor of BAK oligomerization (vIBO), (ii) M36-encoded viral inhibitor of caspase-8 activation (vICA), and (iii) M45-encoded viral inhibitor of RIP/RHIM activation (vIRA). Following infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages, the virus initially deflected receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK)3-dependent necroptosis, the most potent of the three cell death pathways. This process remained independent of caspase-8, although suppression of this apoptotic protease en-hances necroptosis in most cell types. Second, the virus deflected TNF-mediated extrinsic apoptosis, a pathway dependent on autocrine TNF production by macrophages that proceeds independently of mitochondrial death machinery or RIPK3. Third, cytomegalovirus deflected BCL-2 family protein-dependent mitochondrial cell death through combined TNF-dependent and-independent signaling even in the absence of RIPK1, RIPK3, and caspase-8. Furthermore, each of these cell death pathways dictated a distinct pattern of cytokine and chemokine activation. Therefore, cytomegalovirus employs sequential, non-redundant suppression strategies to specifically modulate the timing and execution of necroptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, and intrinsic apoptosis within infected cells to orchestrate virus control and infection-dependent inflammation. Virus-encoded death suppressors together hold control over an intricate network that upends host defense and supports pathogenesis in the intact mammalian host.",Apoptosis | BCL2 family | Cell death | CmvPCD | Cytomegalovirus | DNA virus | Extrinsic apoptosis | HCMV | Herpesvirus | IFN | Inflammation | Intrinsic apoptosis | M36 | M38.5 | M41.1 | M45 | Macrophages | MCMV | Mitochondria | Myeloid cells | Necroptosis | Pyroptosis | Replication | RIPK1 | RIPK3 | Serine protease | TNF | UL36 | VIBO Caspase-8 | VICA | VIRA | VMIA,0,1,NIAID,AI020211,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,papers by authors,0,2021-09

TNFα promotes necroptosis, and its expression is facilitated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) but is inhibited by the RNA-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP, encoded by the Zfp36 gene). We have stimulated murine macrophages from WT, MyD88-/-, Trif-/-, MyD88-/- Trif-/-, MK2-/-, and Zfp36-/- mice with graded doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and various inhibitors to evaluate the role of various genes in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-induced necroptosis. Necrosome signaling, cytokine production, and cell death were evaluated by immunoblotting, ELISA, and cell death assays, respectively. We observed that during TLR4 signaling, necrosome activation is mediated through the adaptor proteins MyD88 and TRIF, and this is inhibited by MK2. In the absence of MK2-mediated necrosome activation, lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFα expression was drastically reduced, but MK2-deficient cells became highly sensitive to necroptosis even at low TNFα levels. In contrast, during tonic TLR4 signaling, WT cells did not undergo necroptosis, even when MK2 was disabled. Of note, necroptosis occurred only in the absence of TTP and was mediated by the expression of TNFα and activation of JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK). These results reveal that TTP plays an important role in inhibiting TNFα/JNK-induced necrosome signaling and resultant cytotoxicity.",,2,1,CIHR,375862,Canadian Institutes of Health Research,papers by authors,0,2020-04

These findings may explain outstanding questions in the field such as why certain gasdermin members sensitize cells to apoptosis, and why some apoptotic cells also show morphological features of necrosis.

Mechanistically, we show that the HtrA2 protease activity regulates autophagy and controls the magnitude and duration of inflammasome signaling by preventing prolonged accumulation of the inflammasome adaptor ASC. Our findings identify HtrA2 as a non-redundant mitochondrial quality control effector that keeps NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes in check.",,10,1,NIH,R01AR055398,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2018-12

Here we identify a previously unrecognized mechanism that functions to downregulate the necrosome, a central signaling complex involved in inflammation and necroptosis. We show that RipK1 associates with RipK3 in an early necrosome, independent of RipK3 phosphorylation and MLKL-induced necroptotic death. We find that formation of the early necrosome activates K48-ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of RipK1, Caspase-8, and other necrosomal proteins. Our results reveal that the E3-ubiquitin ligase Triad3a promotes this negative feedback loop independently of typical RipK1 ubiquitin editing enzymes, cIAPs, A20, or CYLD. Finally, we show that Triad3a-dependent necrosomal degradation limits necroptosis and production of inflammatory cytokines. These results reveal a new mechanism of shutting off necrosome signaling and may pave the way to new strategies for therapeutic manipulation of inflammatory responses.",,10,1,NIH,055398,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2018-06

Since the field continues to expand and novel mechanisms that orchestrate multiple cell death pathways are unveiled, we propose an updated classification of cell death subroutines focusing on mechanistic and essential (as opposed to correlative and dispensable) aspects of the process. As we provide molecularly oriented definitions of terms including intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic apoptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos, entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell death, cellular senescence, and mitotic catastrophe, we discuss the utility of neologisms that refer to highly specialized instances of these processes. The mission of the NCCD is to provide a widely accepted nomenclature on cell death in support of the continued development of the field.",,1597,1,NIA,P01AG049665,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2018-03

To counter this, innate immune responses can also sense some T3SS components to initiate anti-bacterial mechanisms. The Yersinia pestis T3SS is particularly effective and sophisticated in manipulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, which are typically processed into their mature forms by active caspase-1 following inflammasome formation. Some effectors, like Y. pestis YopM, may block inflammasome activation. Here we show that YopM prevents Y. pestis induced activation of the Pyrin inflammasome induced by the RhoA-inhibiting effector YopE, which is a GTPase activating protein. YopM blocks YopE-induced Pyrin-mediated caspase-1 dependent IL-1β/IL-18 production and cell death. We also detected YopM in a complex with Pyrin and kinases RSK1 and PKN1, putative negative regulators of Pyrin. In contrast to wild-type mice, Pyrin deficient mice were also highly susceptible to an attenuated Y. pestis strain lacking YopM, emphasizing the importance of inhibition of Pyrin in vivo. A complex interplay between the Y. pestis T3SS and IL-1β/IL-18 production is evident, involving at least four inflammasome pathways. The secreted effector YopJ triggers caspase-8- dependent IL-1β activation, even when YopM is present. Additionally, the presence of the T3SS needle/translocon activates NLRP3 and NLRC4-dependent IL-1β generation, which is blocked by YopK, but not by YopM. Taken together, the data suggest YopM specificity for obstructing the Pyrin pathway, as the effector does not appear to block Y. pestis-induced NLRP3, NLRC4 or caspase-8 dependent caspase-1 processing. Thus, we identify Y. pestis YopM as a microbial inhibitor of the Pyrin inflammasome. The fact that so many of the Y. pestis T3SS components are participating in regulation of IL-1β/IL-18 release suggests that these effects are essential for maximal control of innate immunity during plague.",,57,1,NHLBI,R01HL076278,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,2016-12

Such an unavoidable variant of cellular demise is generally referred to as 'accidental cell death' (ACD). In most settings, however, cell death is initiated by a genetically encoded apparatus, correlating with the fact that its course can be altered by pharmacologic or genetic interventions. 'Regulated cell death' (RCD) can occur as part of physiologic programs or can be activated once adaptive responses to perturbations of the extracellular or intracellular microenvironment fail. The biochemical phenomena that accompany RCD may be harnessed to classify it into a few subtypes, which often (but not always) exhibit stereotyped morphologic features. Nonetheless, efficiently inhibiting the processes that are commonly thought to cause RCD, such as the activation of executioner caspases in the course of apoptosis, does not exert true cytoprotective effects in the mammalian system, but simply alters the kinetics of cellular demise as it shifts its morphologic and biochemical correlates. Conversely, bona fide cytoprotection can be achieved by inhibiting the transduction of lethal signals in the early phases of the process, when adaptive responses are still operational. Thus, the mechanisms that truly execute RCD may be less understood, less inhibitable and perhaps more homogeneous than previously thought. Here, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death formulates a set of recommendations to help scientists and researchers to discriminate between essential and accessory aspects of cell death.",,574,1,NIH,P50DA000266,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2015-01

BHB levels are elevated by starvation, caloric restriction, high-intensity exercise, or the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet. Prolonged fasting reduces inflammation; however, the impact that ketones and other alternative metabolic fuels produced during energy deficits have on the innate immune response is unknown. We report that BHB, but neither AcAc nor the structurally related short-chain fatty acids butyrate and acetate, suppresses activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to urate crystals, ATP and lipotoxic fatty acids. BHB did not inhibit caspase-1 activation in response to pathogens that activate the NLR family, CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4) or absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome and did not affect non-canonical caspase-11, inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, BHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by preventing K + efflux and reducing ASC oligomerization and speck formation. The inhibitory effects of BHB on NLRP3 are not dependent on chirality or starvation-regulated mechanisms like AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy or glycolytic inhibition. BHB blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without undergoing oxidation in the TCA cycle, and independently of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), the G protein-coupled receptor GPR109A or hydrocaboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). BHB reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 production in human monocytes. In vivo, BHB or a ketogenic diet attenuates caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in mouse models of NLRP3-mediated diseases such as Muckle-Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and urate crystal-induced peritonitis. Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of caloric restriction or ketogenic diets may be linked to BHB-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.",,731,0,NIA,AG043608,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2015-01

IKKα controls the inflammasome at the level of the adaptor ASC, which interacts with IKKα in the nucleus of resting macrophages in an IKKα kinase-dependent manner. Loss of IKKα kinase activity results in inflammasome hyperactivation. Mechanistically, the downstream nuclear effector IKK-related kinase (IKKi) facilitates translocation of ASC from the nucleus to the perinuclear area during inflammasome activation. ASC remains under the control of IKKα in the perinuclear area following translocation of the ASC/IKKα complex. Signal 2 of NLRP3 activation leads to inhibition of IKKα kinase activity through the recruitment of PP2A, allowing ASC to participate in NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.

During apoptosis, Omi/HtrA2 is released into the cytoplasm where it participates in cell death. While confined in the inter-membrane space of the mitochondria, Omi/HtrA2 has a pro-survival function that may involve the regulation of protein quality control (PQC) and mitochondrial homeostasis. Loss of Omi/HtrA2's protease activity causes the neuromuscular disorder of the mnd2 (motor neuron degeneration 2) mutant mice. These mice develop multiple defects including neurodegeneration with parkinsonian features. Loss of Omi/HtrA2 in non-neuronal tissues has also been shown to cause premature aging. The normal function of Omi/HtrA2 in the mitochondria and how its deregulation causes neurodegeneration or premature aging are unknown. Here we report that the mitochondrial Mulan E3 ubiquitin ligase is a specific substrate of Omi/HtrA2. During exposure to H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, Omi/HtrA2 degrades Mulan, and this regulation is lost in cells that carry the inactive protease. Furthermore, we show accumulation of Mulan protein in various tissues of mnd2 mice as well as in Omi/HtrA2(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). This causes a significant decrease of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) protein, and increased mitophagy. Our work describes a new stress-signaling pathway that is initiated in the mitochondria and involves the regulation of Mulan by Omi/HtrA2 protease. Deregulation of this pathway, as it occurs in mnd2 mutant mice, causes mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy, and could be responsible for the motor neuron disease and the premature aging phenotype observed in these animals.

In view of the substantial progress in the biochemical and genetic exploration of cell death, time has come to switch from morphological to molecular definitions of cell death modalities. Here we propose a functional classification of cell death subroutines that applies to both in vitro and in vivo settings and includes extrinsic apoptosis, caspase-dependent or-independent intrinsic apoptosis, regulated necrosis, autophagic cell death and mitotic catastrophe. Moreover, we discuss the utility of expressions indicating additional cell death modalities. On the basis of the new, revised NCCD classification, cell death subroutines are defined by a series of precise, measurable biochemical features. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",autophagy | mitochondrial membrane permeabilization | necroptosis | parthanatos | TNFR1 | TP53,1731,1,NIGMS,R01GM072124,National Institute of General Medical Sciences,papers by authors,0,2012-01

Absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) is a newly discovered PRR involved in the sensing of dangerous cytosolic DNA produced by infection with DNA viruses. Discussion: Remarkably, recent studies in AIM2-deficient mice showed that AIM2 is uniquely involved in sensing infection with the intracellular bacteria Francisella tularensis and subsequently triggering caspase-1-mediated proinflammatory cytokine production and macrophage cell death, which activate other components of the immune system and eliminate the infected macrophages. Here, we provide an overview of our current understanding of the role of AIM2 in innate immunity against F. tularensis in particular, and how infection of macrophages with this pathogen is thought to activate AIM2. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.",AIM2 | Caspase-1 | Francisella tularensis | Inflammasome | Inflammation | Innate immunity,44,0,NIH,R01AG014357,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2010-07

To investigate the mechanism of Omi/HtrA2's function, we set out to isolate and characterize novel substrates for this protease. We have identified Thanatos-associated protein 5 (THAP5) as a specific interactor and substrate of Omi/HtrA2 in cells undergoing apoptosis. This protein is an uncharacterized member of the THAP family of proteins. THAP5 has a unique pattern of expression and is found predominantly in the human heart, although a very low expression is also seen in the human brain and muscle. THAP5 protein is localized in the nucleus and, when ectopically expressed, induces cell cycle arrest. During apoptosis, THAP5 protein is degraded, and this process can be blocked using a specific Omi/HtrA2 inhibitor, leading to reduced cell death. In patients with coronary artery disease, THAP5 protein levels substantially decrease in the myocardial infarction area, suggesting a potential role of this protein in human heart disease. This work identifies human THAP5 as a cardiac-specific nuclear protein that controls cell cycle progression. Furthermore, during apoptosis, THAP5 is cleaved and removed by the proapoptotic Omi/HtrA2 protease. Taken together, we provide evidence to support that THAP5 and its regulation by Omi/HtrA2 provide a new link between cell cycle control and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes.

Thus, the in-depth investigation of cell death and its mechanisms constitutes a formidable challenge for fundamental and applied biomedical research, and has tremendous implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to standardize the experimental procedures that identify dying and dead cells in cell cultures and/or in tissues, from model organisms and/or humans, in healthy and/or pathological scenarios. Thus far, dozens of methods have been proposed to quantify cell death-related parameters. However, no guidelines exist regarding their use and interpretation, and nobody has thoroughly annotated the experimental settings for which each of these techniques is most appropriate. Here, we provide a nonexhaustive comparison of methods to detect cell death with apoptotic or nonapoptotic morphologies, their advantages and pitfalls. These guidelines are intended for investigators who study cell death, as well as for reviewers who need to constructively critique scientific reports that deal with cellular demise. Given the difficulties in determining the exact number of cells that have passed the point-of-no-return of the signaling cascades leading to cell death, we emphasize the importance of performing multiple, methodologically unrelated assays to quantify dying and dead cells.",,501,1,NCI,R01CA109618,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,2009-01

Authors, reviewers and editors of scientific periodicals are invited to abandon expressions like 'percentage apoptosis' and to replace them with more accurate descriptions of the biochemical and cellular parameters that are actually measured. Moreover, at the present stage, it should be accepted that caspase-independent mechanisms can cooperate with (or substitute for) caspases in the execution of lethal signaling pathways and that 'autophagic cell death' is a type of cell death occurring together with (but not necessarily by) autophagic vacuolization.

C-RAF protein kinase is a direct RAS effector protein, which initiates the classical mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. This signalling cascade mediates diverse biological functions, such as cell growth, proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival. Here we demonstrate that XIAP and c-IAPs bind directly to C-RAF kinase and that siRNA-mediated silencing of XIAP and c-IAPs leads to stabilization of C-RAF in human cells. XIAP binds strongly to C-RAF and promotes the ubiquitylation of C-RAF in vivo through the Hsp90-mediated quality control system, independently of its E3 ligase activity. In addition, XIAP or c-IAP-1/2 knockdown cells showed enhanced cell migration in a C-RAF-dependent manner. XIAP promotes binding of CHIP (carboxy terminal Hsc70-interacting protein), a chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase, to the C-RAF-Hsp90 complex in vivo. Interfering with CHIP expression resulted in stabilization of C-RAF and enhanced cell migration, as observed in XIAP knockdown cells. Our data show an unexpected role of XIAP and c-IAPs in the turnover of C-RAF protein, thereby modulating the MAPK signalling pathway and cell migration.",,76,0,NIH,SFB487,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2008-01

After apoptotic stimuli, Omi is released to the cytoplasm where it binds and cleaves inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. In this report, we investigated the role of Omi in renal cell death following cisplatin treatment. Using primary mouse proximal tubule cells, as well as established renal cell lines, we show that the level of Omi protein is upregulated after treatment with cisplatin. This upregulation is followed by the release of Omi from mitochondria to the cytoplasm and degradation of XIAP. Reducing the endogenous level of Omi protein using RNA interference renders renal cells resistant to cisplatin-induced cell death. Furthermore, we show that the proteolytic activity of Omi is necessary and essential for cisplatin-induced cell death in this system. When renal cells are treated with Omi's specific inhibitor, ucf-101, they become significantly resistant, to cisplatin-induced cell death. Ucf-101 was also able to minimize cisplatin-induced nephrotoxic injury in animals.

However, the role of Omi/HtrA2 in the apoptotic cell death that occurs in vivo under pathological conditions remains unknown. The present study was designed to investigate whether Omi/HtrA2 plays an important role in postischemic myocardial apoptosis. Methods and Results - Male adult mice were subjected to 30 minutes of myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion and treated with vehicle or ucf-101, a novel and specific Omi/HtrA2 inhibitor, 10 minutes before reperfusion. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion significantly increased cytosolic Omi/HtrA2 content and markedly increased apoptosis. Treatment with ucf-101 exerted significant cardioprotective effects, as evidenced by less terminal dUTP nick end-labeling staining, a lower incidence of DNA ladder fragmentation, and smaller infarct size. Furthermore, treatment with ucf-101 before reperfusion attenuated X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein degradation and inhibited caspase-9 and caspase-3 activities. Conclusion - Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that ischemia/reperfusion results in Omi/HtrA2 translocation from the mitochondria to the cytosol, where it promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis via a protease activity-dependent, caspase-mediated pathway.",Apoptosis | Myocardial infarction | Reperfusion,90,1,NHLBI,R01HL063828,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,2005-01

Upon induction of apoptosis, Omi translocates to the cytoplasm and participates in caspase-dependent apoptosis by binding and degrading inhibitor of apoptosis proteins. Omi can also initiate caspase-independent apoptosis in a process that relies entirely on its ability to function as an active protease. To investigate the mechanism of Omi-induced apoptosis, we set out to isolate novel substrates that are cleaved by this protease. We identified HS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1), a mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein, as a specific Omi interactor that is cleaved by Omi both in vitro and in vivo. HAX-1 degradation follows Omi activation in cells treated with various apoptotic stimuli. Using a specific inhibitor of Omi, HAX-1 degradation is prevented and cell death is reduced. Cleavage of HAX-1 was not observed in a cell line derived from motor neuron degeneration 2 mice that carry a mutated form of Omi that affects its proteolytic activity. Degradation of HAX-1 is an early event in the apoptotic process and occurs while Omi is still confined in the mitochondria. Our results suggest that Omi has a unique pro-apoptotic function in mitochondria that involves removal of the HAX-1 anti-apoptotic protein. This function is distinct from its ability to activate caspase-dependent apoptosis in the cytoplasm by degrading inhibitor of apoptosis proteins.",,147,1,NIDDK,R01DK055734,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,papers by authors,0,2004-11

Human caspases functionally segregate into two distinct subfamilies: those involved in cytokine maturation (caspase-1, -4 and -5) and those involved in cellular apoptosis (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9 and -10). Although caspase-12 is phylogenetically related to the cytokine maturation caspases, in mice it has been proposed as a mediator of apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress including amyloid-β cytotoxicity, suggesting that it might contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that a single nucleotide polymorphism in caspase-12 in humans results in the synthesis of either a truncated protein (Csp12-S) or a full-length caspase proenzyme (Csp12-L). The read-through single nucleotide polymorphism encoding Csp12-L is confined to populations of African descent and confers hypo-responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine production in ex vivo whole blood, but has no significant effect on apoptotic sensitivity. In a preliminary study, we find that the frequency of the Csp12-L allele is increased in African American individuals with severe sepsis. Thus, Csp12-L attenuates the inflammatory and innate immune response to endotoxins and in doing so may constitute a risk factor for developing sepsis.",,347,1,NIH,Z01BC010629,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2004-05

The presence of mitochondria in neutrophils was confirmed by quantification of mitochondrial DNA copy number, by detection of mitochondrial porin, and by JC-1 measurement of Δψm. During neutrophilic differentiation, HL-60 cells demonstrated a profound cytochrome c depletion and mitochondrial shape change reminiscent of neutrophils. However, blood neutrophils containing extremely low amounts of cytochrome c displayed strong caspase-9 activation during apoptosis, which was also observed in apoptotic neutrophil-derived cytoplasts lacking any detectable cytochrome c.

SCL/Tal-1 degradation occurred rapidly after caspase activation and preceded the cleavage of the major erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. Expression of a caspase-resistant SCL/Tal-1 in erythroid progenitors was able to prevent amplification of caspase activation, GATA-1 degradation and impaired erythropoiesis induced by growth factor deprivation or death receptor triggering. The potent proerythropoietic activity of uncleavable SCL/Tal-1 was clearly evident in the absence of erythropoietin, a condition that did not allow survival of normal erythroid cells or expansion of erythroblasts expressing caspase-resistant GATA-1. In the absence of erythropoietin, cells expressing caspase-resistant SCL/Tal-1 maintain high levels of Bcl-XL, which inhibits amplification of the caspase cascade and mediates protection from apoptosis.

Alternative models have been postulated for the activation mechanism, namely the oligomerization or induced proximity model and the allosteric regulation model. While the former holds that procaspases become activated upon proper oligomerization by an adaptor protein, the latter states that the adaptor is an allosteric regulator for procaspases. The allosteric regulation model has been applied for the activation of procaspase-9 by apoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf-1) in an oligomeric complex known as the apoptosome. Using approaches that allow for controlled oligomerization, we show here that aggregation of multiple procaspase-9 molecules can induce their activation independent of the apoptosome. Oligomerization-induced procaspase-9 activation, both within the apoptosome and in artificial systems, requires stable homophilic association of the protease domains, raising the possibility that the function of Apaf-1 is not only to oligomerize procaspase-9 but also to maintain the interaction of the caspase-9 protease domain after processing. In addition, we provide biochemical evidence that other apoptosis initiator caspases (caspase-2 and -10) as well as a procaspase involved in inflammation (murine caspase-11) are also activated by oligomerization. Thus, oligomerization of precursor molecules appears to be a general mechanism for the activation of both apoptosis initiator and inflammatory procaspases.",,61,1,NIA,R01AG014357,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2003-05

In this study, we have shown the importance of Bax and Bak in TRAIL-induced apoptosis by studying in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from Bax-/- and Bak-/- animals. TRAIL induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis in wild-type, Bid-/-, Bax-/-, or Bak-/- MEFs, but not in Bax-/- Bak-/- double knockout (DKO) MEFs. Bid, which functions upstream of cytochrome c release, was cleaved in all of the knockout cells except in Bid-/- MEFs. The release of cytochrome c was correlated with caspase-9 activity. TRAIL increased caspase-3 activity in all of the cells except in DKO cells. TRAIL-induced drop in mitochondrial membrane potential was not observed in DKO MEFs. Unlike cytochrome c release, TRAIL-induced Smac/DIABLO release was blocked in Bid-/-, Bax-/-, Bak-/-, or DKO MEFs, suggesting the differential regulation of these mitochondrial proteins during apoptosis. The apoptotic events downstream of mitochondria were intact in DKO MEFs, because microinjection of cytochrome c, or ectopic expression of mature Smac/DIABLO or pretreatment of Smac N7 peptide completely restored TRAIL sensitivity. In conclusion, the data suggest that Bax and Bak differentially regulate the release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria, and Smac/DIABLO can be used to sensitize cells that are deficient in Bax and Bak genes, or resistant to TRAIL.",,174,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2003-04

Smac functions by eliminating the caspase-inhibitory properties of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP), particularly XIAP. In this study, we stably transfected both full-length (FL) and mature (MT) Smac genes into the K562 and CEM leukaemic cell lines. Both FL and MT Smac transfectants increased the sensitivity of leukaemic cells to UV light-induced apoptosis and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Purified cytosol from the mature Smac transfectants, or the addition of human recombinant Smac protein or N-7 peptide into nontransfected cytosol, showed an increased sensitivity to cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3. The mature Smac enhanced the susceptibility of both K562 and CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of the mature Smac protein also inhibited proliferation, as detected by reduced colony formation and Ki-67 expression in leukaemic cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that Smac transfectants displayed significant G0/G1 arrest and reduction in 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Smac sensitized human acute myeloid leukaemia blasts to cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3. However, Smac failed to overcome Apaf-1-deficiency-mediated resistance to cytochrome c in primary leukaemic blasts. In summary, this study reveals that Smac/DIABLO exhibits a potential role in increasing apoptosis and suppressing proliferation in human leukaemic cells.

This paper reports the crystal structure of caspase-9 in an inhibitory complex with the third baculoviral IAP repeat (BIR3) of XIAP at 2.4 Å resolution. The structure reveals that the BIR3 domain forms a heterodimer with a caspase-9 monomer. Strikingly, the surface of caspase-9 that interacts with BIR3 also mediates its homodimerization. We demonstrate that monomeric caspase-9 is catalytically inactive due to the absence of a supporting sequence element that could be provided by homodimerization. Thus, XIAP sequesters caspase-9 in a monomeric state, which serves to prevent catalytic activity.

CARD-8 binds also to ICEBERG and pseudo-ICE, two other recently identified proteins, which bind to the CARD domain of caspase-1 and negatively regulate its activity. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed that CARD-8 is expressed mainly in monocytes, placenta, lymph nodes, and spleen. This pattern of expression is consistent with caspase-1 expression in the same cells and tissues. CARD-8 was also found to negatively regulate NF-κB activation by TNF-α stimulation and by ectopically expressed RICK, suggesting that this protein may control cell survival. Consistent with these results, stable expression of CARD-8 in U937 or THP-1 cells sensitizes the cells to differentiation-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of CARD-8 can also induce apoptosis in transfected cells. The results suggest that CARD-8 represents a new signaling molecule involved in the regulation of caspase-1 and NF-κB activation.",,131,1,NIA,R01AG014357,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2002-04

However, direct visualization of the Bid-induced release of various proteins from the highly compartmentalized intermembrane space and the changes in the mitochondrial metabolic machinery remain elusive. Using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins and immunostaining in individual permeabilized HepG2 cells, first we demonstrated that truncated Bid (15.5-kDa C-terminal fragment, tBid) evoked a rapid and essentially complete release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from every mitochondrion. To establish at a resolution of seconds the kinetics of tBid-induced cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release and depolarization, we monitored the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) fluorimetrically in permeabilized cells and applied a rapid filtration method to obtain cytosolic fractions for Western blotting. We found that subnanomolar doses of tBid were sufficient to evoke cytochrome c release and mitochondrial depolarization, whereas full-length Bid was 100-fold less effective. Bcl-xL prevented tBid-induced cytochrome c release and depolarization. In response to 2.5 nM tBid, cytochrome c release started after a 10 s delay, displayed rapid progression, and was complete at 50-70 s. Release of Smac/DIABLO was synchronized with cytochrome c release, whereas the loss of Δψm lagged slightly behind cytochrome c release. Furthermore, tBid-induced cytochrome c release was insensitive to changes in substrate composition, but tBid-induced depolarization did not occur in the presence of extramitochondrial ATP supply. Thus, tBid-induced permeabilization of the outer membrane permits rapid release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from all domains of the intermembrane space. The tBid-induced loss of Δψm occurs after cytochrome c release and reflects impairment of oxidative metabolism.",,154,1,NIA,R01AG013487,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2002-02

Human caspase-14 appears to be only weakly processed during apoptosis, and it does not cleave classical caspase substrates. Post partum, caspase-14 is prominently expressed by human keratinocytes and reportedly participates in terminal differentiation of complex epithelia. Here we provide evidence challenging the view that caspase-14 expression or processing is linked exclusively to terminal keratinocyte differentiation. We demonstrate that caspase-14 expression extended to multiple cell lines derived from simple epithelia of the breast, prostate, and stomach. In keratinocytes and breast epithelial cells, caspase-14 expression was upregulated in high-density cultures and during forced suspension culture. These effects were primarily due to transcriptional activation as indicated by reporter gene assays using a 2 kb caspase-14 promoter fragment. Importantly, caspase-14 was not cleaved during forced suspension culture of either cell type although this treatment induced caspase-dependent apoptosis (anoikis). Forced expression of caspase-14 in immortalized human keratinocytes had no effect on cell death in forced suspension nor was the transfected caspase-14 processed in this setting. In contrast to postconfluent and forced suspension culture, terminal differentiation of keratinocytes induced in vitro by Ca2+ treatment was not associated with increased caspase-14 expression or promoter activity. Our results indicate that (1) caspase-14 is expressed not only in complex but also simple epithelia; (2) cells derived from complex and simple epithelia upregulate caspase-14 expression in conditions of high cell density or lack of matrix interaction and; (3) in both cell types this phenomenon is due to transcriptional regulation.",Anoikis | Apoptosis | Caspase-14 | Epithelial cells | Keratinocytes | Transcriptional regulation,45,0,NIH,R01AG014357,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2002-01

U937 cells with stable transfection of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (c-IAP1) are resistant to TNFα-induced activation of caspases, Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release and Δψm collapse. In addition, both c-IAP1 and XIAP were not up-regulated upon prolonged exposure to TNFα In contrast, there was a caspase-dependent cleavage of XIAP, but not c-IAP1, during treatment with TNFα for 7 days.

Here, we demonstrate that serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor essential for proliferative gene expression, is cleaved by caspases and that this cleavage occurs in proliferating murine fibroblasts and can be induced in the human B-cell line BJAB. We identify the two major sites at which SRF cleavage occurs as Asp245 and Asp254, the caspases responsible for the cleavage and generate a mutant of SRF resistant to cleavage in BJAB cells. Investigation of the physiological and functional significance of SRF cleavage reveals that it correlates with the loss of c-fos expression, whereby neither SRF cleavage fragment retains transcriptional activity. Moreover, the expression of a noncleavable SRF in BJAB cells suppresses apoptosis induced by Fas cross-linking. These results suggest that for apoptosis to proceed, the transcriptional events promoting cell survival and proliferation, in which SRF is involved, must first be inactivated.",,25,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2001-09

To treat malignant gliomas with this approach, it would be preferred to restrict induction of apoptosis to tumor cells by establishing a tumor-specific expression system. Telomerase is an attractive target because the vast majority of malignant gliomas have telomerase activity whereas normal brain cells do not. Activation of telomerase is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level of the telomerase catalytic subunit [human telomerase reverse transcriptase, (hTERT)]. Therefore, we hypothesized that using a hTERT promoter-driven vector system, an apoptosis-inducible gene may be preferentially restricted to telomerase- or hTERT-positive tumor cells. In this study, we constructed an expression vector consisting of the constitutively active caspase-6 (rev-caspase-6) under the hTERT promoter (hTERT/rev-caspase-6) and then investigated its antitumor effect on malignant glioma cells. The rationale for using the rev-caspase-6 gene is because it induces apoptosis independent of the initiator caspases. We demonstrated that the hTERT/rev-caspase-6 construct induced apoptosis in hTERT-positive malignant glioma cells, but not in hTERT-negative astrocytes, fibroblasts, and alternative lengthening of telomeres cells. In addition, the growth of s.c. tumors in nude mice was significantly suppressed by the treatment with hTERT/rev-caspase-6 construct. The present results strongly suggest that the telomerase-specific transfer of the rev-caspase-6 gene under the hTERT promoter is a novel targeting approach for the treatment of malignant gliomas.",,141,0,NIA,R01AG013487,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2001-08

The 15-kDa truncated BAD is a more potent inducer of apoptosis than the wild-type protein, whereas a mutant BAD resistant to caspase 3 cleavage is a weak apoptosis inducer. Truncated BAD is detectable only in the mitochondrial fraction, interacts with BCL-XL at least as effectively as the wild-type protein, and is more potent than wild-type BAD in inducing cytochrome c release. Human BAD, which is 43 amino acids shorter than its mouse counterpart, is also cleaved by a caspase(s) upon exposure of Jurkat T cells to anti-FAS antibody, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), or TRAIL. Moreover, a truncated form of human BAD lacking the N-terminal 28 amino acids is more potent than wild-type BAD in inducing apoptosis. The generation of truncated BAD was blocked by Bcl-2 in IL-3-deprived 32Dcl3 cells but not in Jurkat T cells exposed to anti-FAS antibody, TNF-α, or TRAIL.

The activation of caspase-3 by caspase-9 is known to depend on the assembly of a multimolecular complex that includes Apaf-1 and caspase-9.

Two major proapoptotic pathways have been described: (a) a death receptor pathway; and (b) a mitochondrial pathway. We reported previously that Akt and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor send separate, redundant survival signals that act to inhibit the mitochondrial proapoptotic pathway in prostate cancer LNCaP cells. However, it was unclear at what level the pro- and antiapoptotic signals interact in these cells, and it was also unclear whether these signals would inhibit the death receptor pathway. We found that EGF can protect LNCaP cells from apoptosis induced by LY294002 but not from tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, TNF-α induced apoptosis under conditions in which Akt was active. Treatment with TNF-α resulted in activation of caspase 8 and cleavage of BID, which in turn induced cytochrome c release and caspase 9-dependent activation of effector caspases. Thus, proapoptotic signals induced by both TNF-α and LY294002 converge on mitochondria and trigger cytochrome c release. Because EGF can inhibit cytochrome c release induced by LY294002 but not cytochrome c release induced by TNF-α, we suggest that the EGF survival mechanism operates on the mitochondrial pathway at a site upstream of cytochrome c release. The ability of TNF-α to bypass survival signals from activated EGF receptor and Akt in prostate cancer cells makes death receptor signaling a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention.",,54,0,NCI,P01CA076465,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,2001-03

In a cell-free system, we have addressed the order in which apical and effector caspases, caspases-9 and -3, respectively, are recruited to, activated and retained within the apoptosome. We propose a multi-step process, whereby catalytically active processed or unprocessed caspase-9 initially binds the Apaf-1 apoptosome in cytochrome c/dATP-activated lysates and consequently recruits caspase-3 via an interaction between the active site cysteine (C287) in caspase-9 and a critical aspartate (D175) in caspase-3. We demonstrate that XIAP, an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein, is normally present in high molecular weight complexes in unactivated cell lysates, but directly interacts with the apoptosome in cytochrome c/dATP-activated lysates. XIAP associates with oligomerized Apaf-1 and/or processed caspase-9 and influences the activation of caspase-3, but also binds activated caspase-3 produced within the apoptosome and sequesters it within the complex. Thus, XIAP may regulate cell death by inhibiting the activation of caspase-3 within the apoptosome and by preventing release of active caspase-3 from the complex.",Apaf-1 | Apoptosome | Caspases | XIAP,320,0,NIA,R01AG013847,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2001-03

Recent studies demonstrated that vCLAP activates NF-κB through an IκB kinase (IKK)-dependent pathway, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that vCLAP associates stably with the IKK complex through direct binding to the C-terminal region of IKKγ. Consistent with this finding, IKKγ was found to be essential for vCLAP-induced NF-κB activation, and the association between vCLAP and the IKK complex induced persistent activation of the IKKs. Moreover, enforced oligomerization of the isolated C-terminal region of vCLAP, which interacts with IKKγ, can trigger NF-κB activation. Finally, substitution of the C-terminal region of IKKγ, which interacts with vCLAP, with the CARD of vCLAP or Bcl1O produced a molecule that was able to activate NF-κB when ectopically expressed in IKKγ-deficient cells.

To identify upstream signaling partners of BCL10, we performed a mammalian two-hybrid analysis and identified CARD9 as a novel CARD-containing protein that interacts selectively with the CARD activation domain of BCL10. When expressed in cells, CARD9 binds to BCL10 and activates NF-κB.

It mediates its apoptotic effects through one of two receptors, DR4 and DR5, which are members of of the TNF receptor family, and whose cytoplasmic regions contain death domains. In addition, TRAIL also binds to 3 'decoy' receptors, DcR2, a receptor with a truncated death domain, DcR1, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor, and OPG a secreted protein which is also known to bind to another member of the TNF family, RANKL. However, although apoptosis depends on the expression of one or both of the death domain containing receptors DR4 and/or DR5, resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis does not correlate with the expression of the 'decoy' receptors. Previously, TRAIL has been described to bind to all its receptors with equivalent high affinities. In the present work, we show, by isothermal titration calorimetry and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, that the rank order of affinities of TRAIL for the recombinant soluble forms of its receptors is strongly temperature dependent. Although DR4, DR5, DcR1, and OPG show similar affinities for TRAIL at 4 °C, their rank-ordered affinities are substantially different at 37 °C, with DR5 having the highest affinity (K(D) ≤ 2 nM) and OPG having the weakest (K(D) = 400 nM). Preferentially enhanced binding of TRAIL to DR5 was also observed at the cell surface. These results reveal that the rank ordering of affinities for protein-protein interactions in general can be a strong function of temperature, and indicate that sizeable, but hitherto unobserved, TRAIL affinity differences exist at physiological temperature, and should be taken into account in order to understand the complex physiological and/or pathological roles of TRAIL.",,212,1,NCI,P01CA078890,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,2000-07

We recently showed that cell-permeable Bcl-2 binding peptides could induce apoptosis of human myeloid leukemia in vitro and suppress its growth in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Here we report the discovery of HA14-1, a small molecule (molecular weight = 409) and nonpeptidic ligand of a BCl-2 surface pocket, by using a computer screening strategy based on the predicted structure of Bcl-2 protein. In vitro binding studies demonstrated the interaction of HA14-1 with this Bcl-2 surface pocket that is essential for Bcl-2 biological function. HA14-1 effectively induced apoptosis of human acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60) cells overexpressing Bcl-2 protein that was associated with the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-9 followed by caspase-3. Cytokine response modifier A, a potent inhibitor of Fas-mediated apoptosis, did not block apoptosis induced by HA14-1. Whereas HA14-1 strongly induced the death of NIH 3T3 (Apaf-1(+/+)) cells, it had little apoptotic effect on Apaf-1-deficient (Apaf-1(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. These data are consistent with a mechanism by which HA14-1 induces the activation of Apaf-1 and caspases, possibly by binding to Bcl-2 protein and inhibiting its function. The discovery of this cell-permeable molecule provides a chemical probe to study Bcl-2-regulated apoptotic pathways in vivo and could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents.",,1110,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2000-06

TRAIL selectively reduced the number of erythroblasts, showing intermediate levels of glycophorin A (glycophorin A(interm)) surface expression, which appeared in liquid cultures supplemented with stem cell factor + interleukin 3 + erythropoietin at days 7-10. However, neither immature (day 4) glycophorin A(dim) erythroid cells nor mature (day 14) glycophorin A(bright) erythroblasts were sensitive to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, pre- exposure to TRAIL significantly decreased the number and size of erythroid colonies in semisolid assays. These adverse effects of TRAIL were selective for erythropoiesis, as TRAIL did not significantly influence the survival of cells differentiating along the megakaryocytic, granulocytic, or monocytic lineages. Furthermore, TRAIL was detected by Western blot analysis in lysates obtained from normal bone marrow mononuclear cells. These findings indicate that TRAIL acts in a lineage- and stage of differentiation-specific manner, as a negative regulator of normal erythropoiesis.

Members of this family bind to immunosuppressive drugs and on this basis are divided into two classes: FKBPs bind to FK506 and rapamycin, while cyclophilins bind to cyclosporin A. In this paper, we report on insect immunophilin FKBP46 and its associated kinase. The insect FKBP46 belongs to the high-molecular-weight immunophilins and shares many characteristic features with its mammalian counterparts, but its functional role remains unclear. Here, we show that FKBP46 is phosphorylated by a protein kinase present in the nucleus of both insect Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) and human Jurkat cells. This protein kinase is immunoreactive with polyclonal antiserum raised against Drosophila melanogaster casein kinase II (CKII). We have cloned, overexpressed and characterized a new member of the CKII family derived from Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Recombinant Sf9 CKII α subunit shares 75% identity to human, chicken and Drosophila melanogaster homologs, whereas the Sf9 CKII β subunit is 77% identical to rat, chicken and human. Moreover, we demonstrate that the insect immunophilin FKBP46 can be phosphorylated by human and Sf9 casein kinase II. Finally, we show that FKBP46 interacts with DNA, and this interaction is not prevented by phosphorylation. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we show that immature erythroid cells express several death receptors whose ligands are produced by mature erythroblasts. Exposure of erythroid progenitors to mature erythroblasts or death-receptor ligands resulted in caspase-mediated degradation of the transcription factor GATA-1, which is associated with impaired erythroblast development. Expression of a caspase- resistant GATA-1 mutant, but not of the wild-type gene, completely restored erythroid expansion and differentiation following the triggering of death receptors, indicating that there is regulatory feedback between mature and immature erythroblasts through caspase-mediated cleavage of GATA-1. Similarly, erythropoiesis blockade following Epo deprivation was largely prevented by the expression of caspase-inhibitory proteins or caspase- resistant GATA-1 in erythroid progenitors.

Death of these neurons is diminished by an inhibitor of caspase-3 but not by an inhibitor of caspase-1. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide inhibit induction of caspase-3 and prevent death. Experiments in which CGN intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) was manipulated by either changing [K+](e) or adding a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel antagonist or a Ca2+ ionophore to the medium showed that caspase-3 mRNA rises 2.5-fold when [Ca2+](i) is diminished from 300 to 150 nM, with a corresponding rise in peak caspase enzyme activity. Whereas the caspase-3 mRNA level does not rise further with a still greater diminution in [Ca2+](i), peak caspase enzyme activity continues to increase, reaching sevenfold induction when [Ca2+](i) is reduced to 55 nM. In CGNs in which [Ca2+](i) is set at 55 nM by incubation in 5 mM [K+](e), treatment with forskolin or dibutyryl 3',5'-cyclic adenosine-5'-monophosphate delays caspase-3 induction and diminishes death but does not alter [Ca2+](i). We conclude that, in immature CGNs, both caspase-3 transcription and the subsequent processing of caspase-3 are induced by a fall in [Ca2+](i). Elevating cyclic AMP content delays caspase-3 induction by a mechanism that does not require an increase in [Ca2+](i).",Apoptosis | Caspase-3 | Cerebellar granule neurons | Cyclic AMP | Forskolin,88,1,NINDS,P01NS008075,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,papers by authors,0,1999-07

Here we show using gel filtration that full-length Apaf-1 exists as a monomer that can be transformed to an oligomeric complex made of at least eight subunits after binding to cytochrome c and dATP. Apaf-1 binds to cytochrome c in the absence of dATP but does not form the oligomeric complex. However, when dATP is added to the cytochrome c-bound Apaf-1 complex, complete oligomerization occurs, suggesting that oligomerization is driven by hydrolysis of dATP. This was supported by the observation that ATP, but not the nonhydrolyzable adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate), can induce oligomerization of the Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex. Like the spontaneously oligomerizing Apaf-530, which lacks its WD-40 domain, the oligomeric full- length Apaf-1-cytochrome c complex can bind and process procaspase-9 in the absence of additional dATP or cytochrome c. However, unlike the truncated Apaf-530 complex, the full-length Apaf-1 complex can release the mature caspase-9 after processing. Once released, mature caspase-9 can process procaspase-3, setting into motion the caspase cascade. These observations indicate that cytochrome c and dATP are required for oligomerization of Apaf- 1 and suggest that the WD-40 domain plays an important role in oligomerization of full-length Apaf-1 and the release of mature caspase-9 from the Apaf-1 oligomeric complex.",,406,1,NIA,R01AG014357,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,1999-06

To address the regulation of human caspase activation, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is devoid of endogenous caspases. The apical procaspases, -8β and - 10, were efficiently processed and activated in yeast. Although protease activity, per se, was insufficient to drive cell death, caspase-10 activity had little effect on cell viability, whereas expression of caspase-8β was cytotoxic. This lethal phenotype was abrogated by co-expression of the pan- caspase inhibitor, baculovirus p35, and by mutation of the active site cysteine of procaspase-8β. In contrast, autoactivation of the executioner caspase-3 and -6 zymogens was not detected. Procaspase-3 activation required co-expression of procaspase-8 or -10. Surprisingly, activation of procaspase- 6 required proteolytic activities other than caspase-8, -10, or -3. Caspase- 8β or -10 activity was insufficient to catalyze the maturation of procaspase-6. Moreover, a constitutively active caspase-3, although cytotoxic in its own right, was unable to induce the processing of wild-type procaspase-6 and vice versa. These results distinguish sequential modes of activation for different caspases in vivo and establish a yeast model system to examine the regulation of caspase cascades. Moreover, the distinct terminal phenotypes induced by various caspases attest to differences in the cellular targets of these apoptotic proteases, which may be defined using this system.",,78,1,NCI,R01CA067032,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,1999-01

In the cytosol, cytochrome c binds to the CED-4 homologue, Apaf-1, thereby triggering Apaf-1-mediated activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9 is thought to propagate the death signal by triggering other caspase activation events, the details of which remain obscure. Here, we report that six additional caspases (caspases-2, -3, -6, - 7, -8, and -10) are processed in cell-free extracts in response to cytochrome c, and that three others (caspases-1, -4, and -5) failed to be activated under the same conditions. In vitro association assays confirmed that caspase-9 selectively bound to Apaf-1, whereas caspases-1, -2, -3, -6, -7, - 8, and -10 did not. Depletion of caspase-9 from cell extracts abrogated cytochrome c-inducible activation of caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -10, suggesting that caspase-9 is required for all of these downstream caspase activation events. Immunodepletion of caspases-3, -6, and -7 from cell extracts enabled us to order the sequence of caspase activation events downstream of caspase-9 and reveal the presence of a branched caspase cascade. Caspase-3 is required for the activation of four other caspases (- 2, -6, -8, and -10) in this pathway and also participates in a feedback amplification loop involving caspase-9.",Apaf-1 | Apoptosis | Caspases | Cell-free | Cytochrome C,1613,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,1999-01

Mutation of the conserved Thr-402 to alanine greatly reduces autophosphorylation and protein kinase activity following cleavage. Thus activation of γ-PAK via cleavage by CPP32 is a two-step mechanism wherein autophosphorylation of the regulatory domain is a priming step, and activation coincides with autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain.",,108,1,NIA,R01AG013487,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,1998-10

Ectopic expression of p35 in a number of transgenic animals or cell lines is also anti-apoptotic, giving rise to the hypothesis that the protein is a general inhibitor of caspases. We have verified this hypothesis by demonstrating that purified recombinant p35 inhibits human caspase-1, -3, - 6, -7, -8, and -10 with k(ass) values from 1.2 X 103 to 7 x 105 (M-1 s-1), and with upper limits of K(i) values from 0.1 to 9 nM. Inhibition of 12 unrelated serine or cysteine proteases was insignificant, implying that p35 is a potent caspase-specific inhibitor. Mutation of the putative inhibitory loop to favor caspase-1 resulted in a substantial decline in caspase-3 inhibition, but minimal changes in caspase-1 inhibition. The interaction of p35 with caspase-3, as a model of the inhibitory mechanism, revealed classic slow-binding inhibition, with both active-sites of the caspase-3 dimer acting equally and independently. Inhibition resulted from complex formation between the enzyme and inhibitor, which could be visualized under nondenaturing conditions, but was dissociated by SDS to give p35 cleaved at Asp87, the P1 residue of the inhibitor. Complex formation requires the substrate-binding cleft to be unoccupied. Taken together, these data revealed that p35 is an active-site-directed inhibitor highly adapted to inhibiting caspases.",,191,0,NHLBI,R01HL051399,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",papers by authors,0,1998-07

Since R- cells stably transfected with p35 do not transform, our observations suggest that in addition to its effect as an inhibitor of apoptosis, the baculovirus p35 protein has transforming potential that requires the presence of the IGF-IR. The possibility that these two properties could be separated was confirmed by demonstrating that R508 cells expressing another anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl- 2, could not form tumors in nude mice.",,17,1,NIA,P01AG000378,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,1998-04

Here we compared the mechanism by which IAPs interfere with activation of caspase-3 and other effector caspases in cytosolic extracts where caspase activation was initiated by caspase-8, a proximal protease activated by ligation of TNF-family receptors, or by cytochrome c, which is released from mitochondria into the cytosol during apoptosis. These studies demonstrate that XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 can prevent the proteolytic processing of pro-caspases -3, -6 and -7 by blocking the cytochrome c-induced activation of pro-caspase-9. In contrast, these IAP family proteins did not prevent caspase-8-induced proteolytic activation of pro-caspase-3; however, they subsequently inhibited active caspase-3 directly, thus blocking downstream apoptotic events such as further activation of caspases. These findings demonstrate that IAPs can suppress different apoptotic pathways by inhibiting distinct caspases and identify pro-caspase-9 as a new target for IAP-mediated inhibition of apoptosis.",Apoptosis | c/IAP | Caspase | Cytochrome,1209,0,NIA,R01AG015402,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,1998-04

To improve the prognosis, it is absolutely essential to explore novel modalities of treatment. Recently, we have demonstrated that interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (ICE), a mammalian homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3, induces apoptotic cell death in malignant glioma cells. To date, ICE and ICE-like proteases (the ICE family), such as Ich-1(L), CPP32β, Mch2α, and Mch3α, have been shown to mediate apoptosis in some cells. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the ICE gene family functions as a useful tool for the treatment of malignant glioma cells through induction of apoptosis. The transient transfection assays showed that CPP32β and Mch2α genes induced apoptotic cell death in malignant glioma cells more effectively than did the ICE, Ich-1(L), and Mch3α genes. To improve the efficiency of gene transfer into malignant glioma cells, we constructed the retroviral vectors containing the ICE gene family. The retroviral transfer of CPP32β or Mch2α gene effectively induced apoptosis in malignant glioma cells in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of tumors grown in mice with retrovirus containing CPP32β significantly inhibited growth of the tumors through induction of apoptosis. The retroviral transfer of CPP32β or Mch2α, therefore, may be a novel and promising approach for the treatment of malignant glioma, an invariably fatal tumor.",,27,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,1998-03

In this study we demonstrate processing/activation of at least four ICE-like proteases during the execution phase of apoptosis in human monocytic tumor THP.1 cells. Apoptosis was accompanied by processing of Ich-1, CPP32, and Mch3α to their catalytically active subunits, and lysates from these cells displayed a proteolytic activity with kinetics, characteristic of CPP32/Mch3α but not of ICE. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used to obtain pure populations of normal and apoptotic cells. In apoptotic cells, extensive cleavage of Ich-1, CPP32, and Mch3α was observed together with proteolysis of the ICE-like protease substrates, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), the 70-kD protein component of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1-70K), and lamins A/B. In contrast, no cleavage of CPP32, Mch3α or the substrates was observed in normal cells. In cells exposed to an apoptotic stimulus, some processing of Ich-1 was detected in morphologically normal cells, suggesting that cleavage of Ich-1 may occur early in the apoptotic process. The ICE-like protease inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe) fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD.FMK), inhibited apoptosis and cleavage of Ich-l, CPP32, Mch3α, Mch2α, PARP, U1-70K, and lamins. These results suggest that Z-VAD.FMK inhibits apoptosis by inhibiting a key effector protease upstream of Ich-1, CPP32, Mch3α, and Mch2α.

Inhibition of CED3/ICE- related proteases has been shown to inhibit neuronal apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, indicating a role for these cysteine proteases in neuronal apoptosis. We have studied the activation of the CED3/ICE-related protease CPP32 in two in vitro models of mouse cerebellar granule neuronal cell death: K+/serum deprivation-induced apoptosis and glutamate-induced necrosis. Pretreatment of granule neurons with a selective, irreversible inhibitor of CED3/ICE family proteases, ZVAD-fluoromethylketone, specifically inhibited granule neuron apoptosis but not necrosis indicating a selective role for CED3/ICE proteases in granule neuron apoptosis. Extracts prepared from apoptotic, but not necrotic, granule neurons contained a protease activity that cleaved the CPP32 substrate Ac-DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin. Induction of the protease activity was prevented by inhibitors of RNA or protein synthesis or by the CED3/ICE protease inhibitor. Affinity labeling of the protease activity with an irreversible CED3/ICE protease inhibitor, ZVK(biotin)D- fluoromethylketone, identified two putative protease subunits, p20 and p18, that were present in apoptotic but not necrotic granule neuron extracts. Western blotting with antibodies to the C terminus of the large subunit of mouse CPP32 (anti-CPP32) identified p20 and p18 as processed subunits of the CPP32 proenzyme. Anti-CPP32 specifically inhibited the DEVD-amc cleaving activity, verifying the presence of active CPP32 protease in the apoptotic granule neuron extracts. Western blotting demonstrated that the CPP32 proenzyme was expressed in granule neurons before induction of apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the CED3/ICE homolog CPP32 is processed and activated during cerebellar granule neuron apoptosis. CPP32 activation requires macromolecular synthesis and CED3/ICE protease activity. The lack of CPP32 activation during granule neuron necrosis suggests that proteolytic processing and activation of CED3/ICE proteases are specific biochemical markers of apoptosis.",apoptosis | Caspase | CED3/ICE proteases | cerebellar neurons | CPP32 | necrosis,272,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,1997-01

In addition, it is not yet clear how the proenzymes of ASCPs are activated or what triggers their activation.

The renaturation of thermally denatured firefly luciferase readily occurs in rabbit reticulocyte lysate by an ATP-dependent process. Earlier studies had shown that this chaperoning activity could be reconstituted, in part, using purified preparations of hsp70 and hsp90. We have extended the description of this system by clarifying the importance of hsp70 and hsp90 and have tested for additional factors that enhance renaturation. Using mutant hsp70 proteins, we have shown that hsp70 is required for luciferase renaturation. We have also found that hsp70 and hsp90 preparations purified by common procedures were contaminated with low levels of DnaJ proteins that are essential for the renaturing activity. When hsp70 and hsp90 preparations free of DnaJ proteins are used, the system must be supplemented with a DnaJ protein to obtain renaturation activity. The yeast DnaJ protein, YDJ-1, was found to be very effective for this purpose. Although significant renaturation can occur with only hsp70 and DnaJ proteins, hsp90 also contributes to the renaturation process, both in the complex environment of reticulocyte lysate and in a purified system. However, using highly purified hsp90 and geldanamycin, a specific inhibitor of hsp90 function, we have determined that hsp90 is not an essential component of the renaturation system. The contribution of hsp90 to renaturation is only partially blocked by geldanamycin, suggesting that this protein may influence activity in more than one way. This study indicates that hsp70, hsp90, and DnaJ proteins function cooperatively to renature damaged proteins in the eukaryotic cytoplasm and provides a framework by which additional components can be identified and individual chaperone contributions can be investigated.",,140,0,NIDDK,R01DK044441,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,papers by authors,0,1996-11

Ara-C induced apoptosis is associated with proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP- ribose) polymerase (PARP) and protein kinase C (PKC) δ. However, the signals involved in this response are unknown. The present studies show that ara-C treatment of U-937 cells is associated with induction of a protease activity that cleaves the tetrapeptides Ac-DEVD-pNA and Ac-DMQD-pNA found at the cleavage sites of PARP and PKCδ, respectively. The ara-C-induced protease activity was sensitive to overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- x(L) and the baculovirus protein p35. By contrast, overexpression of the cowpox virus protein CrmA blocked apoptosis induced by engagement of the Fas receptor but not that induced by ara-C. CrmA overexpression also had no detectable effect on ara-C-induced cleavage of PKCδ. The results further show that ara-C induces activation of the CPP32 protease by a CrmA- insensitive and p35-sensitive mechanism. Similar results were obtained with cisplatinum, etoposide, and camptothecin. These findings indicate that ara-C and other DNA-damaging agents activate a CrmA-insensitive apoptotic pathway involving CPP32 and that these signals differ from those associated with apoptosis induced by the Fas receptor.",,171,1,NCI,R01CA029431,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,1996-09

We demonstrate here that during CTL-mediated cytolysis the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), an enzyme implicated in the repair of double strand breaks in DNA, is specifically cleaved by an interleukin (IL)-1β-converting enzyme (ICE)-like protease. A serine protease inhibitor, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (DCI), which is known to block granzyme B activity, inhibited CTL-induced apoptosis and prevented the degradation of DNA-PKcs in cells but failed to prevent the degradation of purified DNA-PKcs by CTI extracts. However, Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2-Cl (YVAD- CMK) and other cysteine protease inhibitors prevented the degradation of purified DNA-PKcs by CTL extracts. Furthermore, incubation of DNA-PKcs with granzyme B did not produce the same cleavage pattern observed in cells undergoing apoptosis and when this substrate was incubated with either CTL extracts or the ICE-like protease, CPP32. Sequence analysis revealed that the cleavage site in DNA-PKcs during CTL killing was the same as that when this substrate was exposed to CPP32.

However, Ku, the DNA-binding component of the enzyme, remains intact. Degradation of DNA-PKcs was accompanied by loss of DNA-PK activity.

Glucocorticoids, and also 1,25(OH)2D3, mediate the developmental regulation of OC gene transcription. In this study, we established that the −1097 to +23 promoter (pOCZCat) of the rat OC gene confers glucocorticoid responsiveness to both basal and vitamin D-induced OC expression. The presence of multiple glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding sites in the proximal rat OC gene promoter was determined by the combined use of DNase I footprinting, dimethyl sulfate fingerprinting, and gel mobility shift analysis with glucocorticoid receptor protein. One glucocorticoid receptor binding element (GRE) resides immediately downstream of the TATA box (−16 to −1). In vivo activity was established by cotransfection of ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells with an OC-CAT construct in the presence of cloned GRE sequences (wild type or mutant) as competitors. A putative second, less protected GR binding site is located further upstream in the OC gene basal promoter within the region overlapping the TATA box. This is in direct contrast to the organization of GREs in the human OC proximal promoter wherein GR binding at the upstream GRE overlapping the TATA is stronger than at the downstream GRE. In addition, we detected sequence-specific binding of GR protein to another basal promoter element, the OC box (−99 to −76), which contains a central CCAAT motif. The presence of multiple GR binding sites in the rat OC gene proximal promoter indicates that regulation of basal and vitamin D-enhanced transcription by glucocorticoids may involve the integrated activities of multiple, independent GREs. © 1993, American Chemical Society.

Analysis of the steroid binding ability and accumulation of the GR and MR in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells revealed that only 0.35% of the total expressed receptors are actually assembled into cytoplasmic oligomeric receptor complexes. The majority of the overexpressed GR and MR, which amounts to 50 pg/cell, appear to self-aggregate and form insoluble aggregates which fractionate with the nucleus. We believe that this large amount of receptors far exceeds the limited amounts of hsp90, hsp70, and other cellular factors which are required to assemble the heteromeric receptor complex. Attempts to assemble the GR and the MR in vivo by coexpression of the receptors with hsp90 or hsp70 failed to cause any increase in the formation of the steroid binding receptor complex and also in preventing the aggregation of the receptors. On the other hand, in vitro incubation of monomeric GR or MR partially purified from the insoluble receptor aggregates with reticulocyte lysate resulted in complete reconstitution of the oligomeric receptor complex with a concomitant restoration of full steroid binding ability. These data suggest that interaction of hsp90 with the GR or the MR is complex and highly regulated and requires the participation of other cellular factors which are limited in insect cells but can be supplied in vitro by reticulocyte lysate. Since hsp90 interacts with the GR and probably with the MR through the C-terminal steroid binding domain, we examined the possibility that this domain may cause the receptor to self-aggregate in the absence of hsp90 interaction. Deletion of the entire steroid binding domain resulted in overexpression of truncated GR and MR which did not form insoluble aggregates. The truncated GR and MR were associated with the nucleus as DNA binding proteins which can be extracted and solubilized with low concentrations of MgCl2. © 1993, American Chemical Society.

Glucocorticoid treatment of the 380 cell line which expresses high levels of BCL-2 resulted in inhibition of cellular proliferation without induction of apoptosis. On the other hand, glucocorticoid treatment of the 697 cell line which expresses lower levels of the BCL-2 resulted in both inhibition of cellular proliferation and apoptosis with characteristic internucleosomal DNA cleavage. The glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of cellular proliferation in both cell lines was also associated with repression of the c-myc mRNA expression. Taken together, our data suggest that BCL-2 blocks the glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis of the 380 pre-B-lymphocytes by extending their survival when the level of c-myc expression is repressed. Also by repressing the expression of c-myc, glucocorticoid causes apoptosis of the 697 pre-B-lymphocytes in the absence of high level of BCL-2 expression. © 1992, American Association for Cancer Research.

The overproduced hMR binds aldosterone with high affinity (K(d) = 1.36 nM) and has high affinity for cortisol, cortexolone, and progesterone. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of the recombinant hMR with MR-specific antibodies reveal three major protein bands with molecular masses of 115, 119, and 125 kDa. hMR isoforms show maximal accumulation at 48 h post-infection with the recombinant baculovirus. Maximal aldosterone binding was detected at 24 h rather than at 48 h post-infection, suggesting that the assembly of hMR monomers into the nonactivated steroid-binding receptor complexes and/or their stability deteriorates after 24 h post-infection. It is estimated by specific aldosterone binding that 1.2 x 106 hMR molecules are expressed per Sf9 cell (equivalent to 7 pmol/mg of cytosolic protein) at 24 h post-infection. 5-Fold more receptor molecules/cell are expressed but not detected by steroid binding at 48 h post-infection as determined by immunoblot analysis. Using the MR-specific H10E anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody, immunoprecipitation of cytosol from recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells pulse-labeled with 32P(i) demonstrated for the first time that the recombinant hMR is highly phosphorylated. The hMR is expressed as 9-10 S oligomeric complexes (Stokes radii ~ 67-85 Å) that are slightly heavier than the unactivated glucocorticoid receptor and can be converted to smaller 4 S receptor monomers (Stokes radii ~ 25-55 Å) by elevated temperature, pH, and ionic strength. Unlike the glucocorticoid receptor, the oligomeric hMR complex can bind DNA-cellulose without prior activation.

An essential step in the process of understanding such a relationship involves the production of large quantities of the receptor. Using a baculovirus expression system we have been able to overproduce a recombinant rat glucocorticoid receptor (rGR). A cDNA coding for the entire rGR was introduced into the genome of the wild type baculovirus, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, by an in vivo recombination event. Based on specific steroid binding, insect cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus expressed 1-3 x 106 receptor molecules/cell which is 15-45 times more than that expressed normally in a hepatocyte. The recombinant rGR expressed in insect cells is indistinguishable from the bona fide rGR with respect to immunogenic reactivity, cytoplasmic localization, sedimentation, chromatographic and electrophoretic mobility, and hormone and DNA binding. Furthermore, the recombinant rGR is expressed as a functional protein as demonstrated by its ability to specifically bind a glucocorticoid agonist, to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus upon hormone-binding, and to act as a transcriptional enhancer. Pulse labeling of recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells with 32P(i) and isolation of the labeled products by immunoprecipitation demonstrated that the recombinant rGR is a phosphoprotein.

Experimental evidence indicates that the purified nonactivated glucocorticoid receptor contains a single steroid-binding protein and two ~90-kDa nonsteroid-binding subunits identified as heat shock protein (hsp) 90. Translation of the glucocorticoid receptor mRNA in vitro in reticulocyte lysates produces a large nonactivated glucocorticoid receptor complex similar to that found in cytosols. The cell-free synthesized glucocorticoid receptor is able to bind steroid and can be activated further to the DNA-binding form. To test the hypothesis of an active role played by hsp90 in the stabilization of a competent steroid-binding conformation of the glucocorticoid receptor, we have synthesized the receptor in a reticulocyte lysate that has been depleted of hsp90 by immunoadsorption with AC88 anti-hsp90. Although the translation capacity of the reticulocyte system was reduced considerably upon hsp90 removal, the glucocorticoid receptor was synthesized, and a significant number of molecules were found to bind [3H]triamcinolone acetonide. Chromatography on DEAE-cellulose showed that most of the receptor molecules synthesized in hsp90-depleted lysate had lost the capacity to form an oligomeric receptor complex. Addition of purified rat liver hsp90 to the hsp90-depleted lysate before translation did not increase steroid binding nor did it restore formation of the heteromeric receptor complex. Analysis of [35S] methionine-labeled glucocorticoid receptor molecules synthesized in the hsp90-depleted Iysate showed the production of polypeptides differing from the expected chromatographic pattern on DEAE-cellulose. Upon addition of purified hsp90 to the hsp90-depleted lysate, before translation, the 35S-labeled synthesized receptor fractionated on DEAE-cellulose as an intermediate peak between activated and nonactivated receptor forms.

We find that novobiocin, the topoisomerase II inhibitor, is a potent inducer of in vivo internucleosomal DNA cleavage in human CEM lymphocytes. This in vivo effect is very rapid, time- and dose-dependent, requires cellular integrity, and does not require de novo protein synthesis. Recently our data (Alnemri, E. S., and Litwack, G. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 4104-4111) suggested that activation of DNA cleavage in CEM-C7 lymphocytes by glucocorticoids is independent of calcium uptake. Similarly, the novobiocin effect is also independent of calcium uptake and does not occur in isolated CEM nuclei or in CEM cells treated previously with the divalent cation ionophore A23187. Internucleosomal DNA cleavage induced by novobiocin or glucocorticoid generates blunt-ended double-stranded DNA fragments possessing 3'-hydroxyls and 5'-phosphates. As demonstrated by gel retardation analysis and DNase I footprinting, novobiocin causes the disruption and unfolding of an in vitro reconstituted mononucleosome so that it becomes more susceptible to DNase I cleavage. Our data suggest that 1) novobiocin rapid activation of internucleosomal DNA cleavage and chromatin changes in CEM lymphocytes are molecular features of apoptosis or programmed cell death. 2) CEM lymphocytes apparently do not express a Ca2+-dependent endonuclease. 3) The mechanism(s) of glucocorticoid or novobiocin-induced DNA cleavage in CEM lymphocytes involves activation of a constitutive non Ca2+-dependent endonuclease. We propose that the majority of nuclear chromatin is maintained in a highly compact and charge-neutralized state and that disruption of this highly ordered structure, directly by novobiocin or indirectly by glucocorticoid, may lead to the exposure and unmasking of internucleosomal linker DNA regions which are substrates for a constitutive non-Ca2+-dependent endonuclease.",,146,0,NCI,P30CA012227,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,1990-10

Recent data (Compton, M. M., and Cidlowski, J. A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8288-8292) suggested that in vivo treatment of rat thymocytes with glucocorticoids induces a nucleolytic 'lysis gene' product(s) responsible for lymphocytolysis. In this paper, the possibility that lymphocytolysis may result from glucocorticoid-induced nuclease(s) was examined. Using the rat thymocytes as a model system, we have shown by electrophoretic, enzymatic, and amino acid sequence analysis that the putative glucocorticoid-induced nucleases identified recently by Compton and Cidlowski are in fact H1, H1°, and core histones, and their gross appearance is not the result of new histone protein synthesis, but a result of the release of histone-containing nucleosomes during chromatin breakdown. Evidence presented here shows that the putative induced nuclease activity is an artifact of the assay system employed. Because our data do not support induction of a glucocorticoid-induced nuclease(s), we examined the possibility that DNA cleavage might be induced by activation of a constitutive endogenous endonuclease. We have shown that it is possible to produce characteristic internucleosomal DNA cleavage of rat thymocytes, merely by incubating intact nuclei from untreated adrenalectomized rat thymocytes with Ca2+ and Mg2+ for a short period of time. However, in glucocorticoid-sensitive humans CEM-C7 lymphocytes activation of internucleosomal DNA cleavage was independent of calcium uptake. We conclude that glucocorticoid induction of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation does not necessarily require expression of a new nuclease(s), but is the result of the activation of a constitutive endogenous endonuclease(s). Also, our data suggest that the mechanism which controls activation of internucleosomal DNA cleavage in rat thymocytes differs from that which operates in CEM-C7 lymphocytes.",,77,0,NCI,P30CA012227,National Cancer Institute,papers by authors,0,1989-01

PRRs promote activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, thus increasing the transcription of genes encoding proteins related to the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Moreover, it has been shown that increased intrarenal expression of the NLRP3 receptor and IL-1β are associated with reduced kidney function, suggesting a critical role for the NLRP3 inflammasome in CKD progression. Here, we evaluated the effect of PBUTs on inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production in vitro and in vivo. Exposure of human conditionally immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cells to indoxyl sulfate (IS) and a mixture of anionic PBUTs (UT mix) increased expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1β, accompanied by a significant increase in IL-1β secretion and caspase-1 activity. Furthermore, IS and UT mix induced the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, and caspase-1 activity and IL-1β secretion were reduced in the presence of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. IS and UT mix also induced NF-κB activation as evidenced by p65 nuclear translocation and IL-1β production, which was counteracted by an IKK inhibitor. In vivo, using subtotal nephrectomy CKD rats, a significant increase in total plasma levels of IS and the PBUTs, kynurenic acid and hippuric acid, was found, as well as enhanced urinary malondialdehyde levels. CKD kidney tissue showed an increasing trend in expression of NLRP3 inflammasome components, and a decreasing trend in superoxide dismutase-1 levels. In conclusion, we showed that PBUTs induce inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production in proximal tubule cells via oxidative stress and NF-κB signaling, suggesting their involvement in disease-associated inflammatory processes.",Chronic kidney disease | Conditionally immortalized proximal tubule cells | IL-1β | Indoxyl sulfate | Kidney inflammation | NF-κB | NLRP3 inflammasome | Oxidative stress | Protein-bound uremic toxins | Subtotal nephrectomy,0,1,,CVON2012-01,Nierstichting,citing papers,0,2021-10

In severe COVID-19 cases, an increased level of proinflammatory cytokines has been observed in the bloodstream, forming the so-called “cytokine storm”. Generally, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation intensely induces cytokine production as an inflammatory response to viral infection. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome can be a potential target for the treatment of COVID-19. Hence, this review first introduces the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation pathway. Second, we review the cellular/molecular mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., viroporins, ion flux and the complement cascade). Furthermore, we describe the involvement of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (e.g., cytokine storm, respiratory manifestations, cardiovascular comorbidity and neurological symptoms).

However, the underlying mechanism regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. Herein, the effects of Tripartite motif-containing protein 65 (TRIM65) on NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the underlying molecular mechanism were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition or deletion of Trim65 could significantly strengthen agonist induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in THP-1 cells and BMDMs, indicated by increased caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1β secretion. However, TRIM65 had no effect on poly (dA: dT)-induced AIM2 inflammasome activation or flagellin-induced IPAF inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that TRIM65 binds to NACHT domain of NLRP3, promotes lys48- and lys63- linked ubiquitination of NLRP3 and restrains the NEK7-NLRP3 interaction, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and IL-1β secretion. In vivo, three models of inflammatory diseases were used to confirm the suppression role of TRIM65 in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. TRIM65-deficient mice had a higher production of IL-1β induced by lipopolysaccharide in sera, and more IL-1β secretion and neutrophil migration in the ascites, and more severity of joint swelling and associated IL-1β production induced by monosodium urate, suggesting that TRIM65 deficiency was susceptible to inflammation.

The NLRP3 inflammasome agglomerates are consequent to sensing a wide spectrum of pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Certain members of the NLR family have been documented to lump into multimolecular conglomerates called inflammasomes, which are inherently linked to stimulation of the cysteine protease caspase‐1. Following activation, caspase‐1 severs the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)‐1β and IL‐18 to their biologically active forms, with consequent commencement of caspase‐1‐associated pyroptosis. This type of cell death by pyroptosis epitomizes a leading pathway of inflammation. Accumulating scientific documentation has recorded overstimulation of NLRP3 (NOD‐like receptor protein 3) inflammasome involvement in a wide array of inflammatory conditions. IL‐1β is an archetypic inflammatory cytokine implicated in multiple types of inflammatory maladies. Approaches to impede IL‐1β’s actions are possible, and their therapeutic effects have been clinically demonstrated; nevertheless, such strategies are associated with certain constraints. For instance, treatments that focus on systemically negating IL‐1β (i.e., anakinra, rilonacept, and canakinumab) have been reported to result in an escalated peril of infections. Therefore, given the therapeutic promise of an NLRP3 inhibitor, the con-certed escalated venture of the scientific sorority in the advancement of small molecules focusing on direct NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition is quite predictable.",Disease inhibitor | Inflammasome | Inflammation | NLRP3 | NOD‐like receptors,0,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2021-08

After activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a series of cellular events occurs, including caspase 1-mediated proteolytic cleavage and maturation of the IL-1β and IL-18, followed by pyroptotic cell death. Therefore, the NLRP3 inflammasome has become a prime target for the resolution of many inflammatory disorders. Since NLRP3 inflammasome activation can be triggered by a wide range of stimuli and the activation process occurs in a complex, it is difficult to target the NLRP3 inflammasome. During the activation process, various post-translational modifications (PTM) of the NLRP3 protein are required to form a complex with other components.

However, the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unclear. We showed that NLRP3 inflammasome is over-expressed and highly activated in AML bone marrow leukemia cells, which is correlated with poor prognosis. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in AML cells promotes leukemia cells proliferation, inhibits apoptosis and increases resistance to chemotherapy, while inactivation of NLRP3 by caspase-1 or NF-κB inhibitor shows leukemia-suppressing effects. Bayesian networks analysis and cell co-culture tests further suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome acts through IL-1β but not IL-18 in AML. Knocking down endogenous IL-1β or anti-IL-1β antibody inhibits leukemia cells whereas IL-1β cytokine enhances leukemia proliferation. In AML murine model, up-regulation of NLRP3 increases the leukemia burden in bone marrow, spleen and liver, and shortens the survival time; furthermore, knocking out NLRP3 inhibits leukemia progression. Collectively, all these evidences demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome promotes AML progression in an IL-1β dependent manner, and targeting NLRP3 inflammasome may provide a novel therapeutic option for AML.",acute myeloid leukemia | IL-1β | inflammasome | NLRP3 | progression,0,1,NSFC,tspd20210321,Fundamental Research Fund of Shandong University,citing papers,0,2021-06

Importantly, understanding the activation of signaling pathways in response to microbial stimulation is vital to enable further development of immunotherapeutics, which may enable enhanced tolerance to the microbiota or prevent the initiation of the autoimmune process. One such signaling pathway that has been poorly studied in the context of Type 1 diabetes is the role of the inflammasomes, which are multiprotein complexes that can initiate immune responses following detection of their microbial ligands. In this review, we discuss the roles of the inflammasomes in modulating Type 1 diabetes susceptibility, from genetic associations to the priming and activation of the inflammasomes. In addition, we also summarize the available inhibitors for therapeutically targeting the inflammasomes, which may be of future use in Type 1 diabetes.",humans | inflammasomes | microbiota | NOD mice | type 1 diabetes,0,1,NIH,DK 045735,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2021-06

Despite extensive research, there is a lack of conclusive insights into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, which limit the strategies for symptomatic treatment. Therefore, better elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative diseases can provide an important theoretical basis for the discovery of new and effective prevention and treatment methods. The innate immune system is activated during the ageing process and in response to neurodegenerative diseases. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play an important role in the activation of the innate immune system. They mediate inflammatory reactions and pyroptosis, which are closely involved in neurodegeneration. There are different types of inflammasomes, although the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the most common inflammasome; NLRP3 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms that are involved in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its crucial role in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. We will also review various treatments that target the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and alleviate neuroinflammation.

The mechanism by which lactoferrin complexes increases HAdV uptake and induce maturation of human phagocytes is unknown. We show that lactoferrin redirects HAdV types from species B, C, and D to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) cell surface complexes. TLR4-mediated internalization of the HAdV-lactoferrin complex induced an NLRP3-associated response that consisted of cytokine release and transient disruption of plasma membrane integrity, without causing cell death.

We found that IκKβ also regulates the activation and function of the NLRP3 inflammasome beyond the priming step. Two unrelated IκKβ inhibitors, AFN700 and TPCA-1, when applied after priming, fully blocked IL-1β secretion triggered by nigericin in THP-1 cells. Both inhibitors prevented neither inflammasome assembly, as monitored by measuring the formation of ASC specks, nor the generation of caspase-1 p20, a hallmark of caspase-1 activity, but they impaired the initial cleavage and activation of procaspase-1.

Among the various types of inflammasome sensors that has been reported, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) is implicated in various inflammatory diseases and therefore has been most extensively studied. In this study, we aimed to explore whether TAS could influence NLPR3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. The results showed that TAS dose-dependently suppressed the activation of caspase-1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed murine primary macrophages upon nigericin treatment, resulting in reduced mature interleukin-1β (IL-1β) release and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage. TAS greatly reduced ASC speck formation upon the stimulation of nigericin or extracellular ATP. Consistent with reduced cleavage of GSDMD, nigericin-induced pyroptosis was alleviated by TAS. Interestingly, TAS time-dependently suppressed the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 signaling induced by LPS priming. Like TAS, both INK-128 (inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2) and rapamycin (inhibiting mTORC1 only) also inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation, though their effects on mTOR signaling were different.

Much evidence indicates that these different conditions share a common inflammatory mechanism: The activation of the inflammasome complex in peripheral monocytes and in microglia, with the consequent production of high quantities of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. Inflammasomes are a group of multimeric signaling complexes that include a sensor Nod-like receptor (NLR) molecule, the adaptor protein ASC, and caspase-1. The NLRP3 inflammasome is currently the best-characterized inflammasome. Multiple signals, which are potentially provided in combination and include endogenous danger signals and pathogens, trigger the formation of an active inflammasome, which, in turn, will stimulate the cleavage and the release of bioactive cytokines including IL-1β and IL-18.

Among the consequences of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is systemic chronic low-grade inflammation, a cardinal feature of obesity and insulin resistance. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome in adipose tissue may help in the development of specific inhibitors for the treatment and prevention of obesity-mediated metabolic diseases. In this narrative review, the current understanding of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and regulation is highlighted, including its putative roles in adipose tissue dysfunction and insulin resistance.

Methods: Vesicle-like nanoparticles (VLNs) were extracted from garlic chives and other Allium vegetables and their effects on the NLRP3 inflammasome were evaluated in primary macrophages. After garlic chive-derived VLNs (GC-VLNs) were found to exhibit potent anti-NLRP3 inflammasome activity in cell culture, such function was further assessed in a murine acute liver injury disease model, as well as in diet-induced obesity. Finally, GC-VLNs were subjected to omics analysis to identify the active components with anti-NLRP3 inflammasome function. Results: GC-VLNs are membrane-enclosed nanoparticles containing lipids, proteins, and RNAs. They dose-dependently inhibit pathways downstream of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, including caspase-1 autocleavage, cytokine release, and pyroptotic cell death in primary macrophages. The inhibitory effects of GC-VLNs on the NLRP3 inflammasome are specific, considering their marginal impact on activation of other inflammasomes. Local administration of GC-VLNs in mice alleviates NLRP3 inflammasomemediated inflammation in chemical-induced acute liver injury. When administered orally or intravenously, GC-VLNs accumulate in specific tissues and suppress activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and chronic inflammation in diet-induced obese mice. The phospholipid 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) in GC-VLNs has been identified to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

The current study aimed to test our hypothesis that melatonin regulated pyroptosis to alleviate NP by inhibiting NF-κB/NLRP3-dependent signaling. A rat model of spinal nerve ligation (SNL) was established to explore the potential association between melatonin and pyroptosis. Behavioral experiments revealed that SNL provoked severe allodynia which was suppressed by the administration of melatonin, a caspase-1 inhibitor (VX-765), or an NF-κB inhibitor (BAY 11-7085). SNL significantly up-regulated the inflammatory cytokines associated with the excessive activation of NLRP3 components and NF-κB signaling, as well as a marked pyroptosis activation. These effects were partially inhibited by melatonin, VX-765 or BAY 11-7085, and when melatonin and inhibitors were added together, the effect was enhanced.

Inadequate inflammation cannot eliminate the infection of pathogens, while excessive or hyper-reactive inflammation can cause chronic or systemic inflammatory diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS). In response to a brain injury or pathogen invasion, the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on glial cells are activated via binding to cellular damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). This subsequently leads to the activation of NOD (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain)-like receptor proteins (NLRs). In neurodegenerative diseases such as HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic inflammation is a critical contributing factor for disease manifestation including pathogenesis. Emerging evidence points to the involvement of “inflammasomes”, especially the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain-containing (NLRP) complex in the development of these diseases. The activated NLRP3 results in the proteolytic activation of caspase-1 that facilitates the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 proinflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, these and other seminal findings have led to the development of NLRP-targeting small-molecule therapeutics as possible treatment options for neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we will discuss the new advances and evidence-based literature concerning the role of inflammasomes in neurodegenerative diseases, its role in the neurological repercussions of CNS chronic infection, and the examples of preclinical or clinically tested NLRP inhibitors as potential strategies for the treatment of chronic neurological diseases.",Blood-brain barrier (BBB) | Inflammasome inhibitors | Nanotechnology | Neurodegenerative diseases | NeuroHIV | Neuroinflammation | NLRP3 inflammasomes,3,0,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2021-01

We report here that scutellarin, a flavonoid from Erigeron breviscapus, acted as an inhibitor for caspase-11 activation in macrophages. Scutellarin dose-dependently inhibited intracellular LPS-induced release of caspase-11p26 (indicative of caspase-11 activation) and generation of N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D (GSDMD-NT), leading to reduced pyroptosis. It also suppressed the activation of non-canonical nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome as evidenced by reduced apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) speck formation and decreased interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and caspase-1p10 secretion, whereas the NLRP3-specific inhibitor MCC950 only inhibited IL-1β and caspase-1p10 release and ASC speck formation but not pyroptosis.

Although researchers have made great efforts in the field of AD, there are still no well-established strategies to prevent and treat this disease. Therefore, better clarification of the molecular mechanisms associated with the onset and progression of AD is critical to provide a theoretical basis for the establishment of novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Currently, it is generally believed that neuroinflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD. Inflammasome, a multiprotein complex, is involved in the innate immune system, and it can mediate inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, which lead to neurodegeneration. Among the various types of inflammasomes, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most characterised in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in AD. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome causes the generation of caspase-1-mediated interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 in microglia cells, where neuroinflammation is involved in the development and progression of AD. Thus, the NLRP3 inflammasome is likely to be a crucial therapeutic molecular target for AD via regulating neuroinflammation. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on the role and regulatory mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathogenic mechanisms of AD. We also focus on a series of potential therapeutic treatments targeting NLRP3 inflammasome for AD. Further clarification of the regulatory mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome in AD may provide more useful clues to develop novel AD treatment strategies.",Alzheimer's disease | Interleukin -18 | interleukin-1β | NLRP3 inflammasome,21,0,NSFC,82072531,National Natural Science Foundation of China,citing papers,0,2020-12

To date, no drugs specifically targeting inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome have been approved. In this work, we used the known NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor CP-456,773 (aka CRID3 or MCC 950) as our starting point and undertook a Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis and subsequent scaffold-hopping exercise. This resulted in the rational design of a series of novel ester-substituted urea compounds that are highly potent and selective NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, as exemplified by compounds 44 and 45. It is hypothesized that the ester moiety acts as a highly permeable delivery vehicle and is subsequently hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid active species by carboxylesterase enzymes.

Microglia are a major component of the innate immune system, and they respond to acute brain injury by activating and forming classic M1-like (pro-inflammatory) or alternative M2-like (anti-inflammatory) phenotype. The existence of the polarization indicates that the role of microglia in disease’s progression and recovery after ICH is still unclear, perhaps involving microglial secretion of anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is considered to be the main participant in neuroinflammation. Recent evidence has shown that NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated after ICH, resulting in inflammatory cascade reactions and aggravating brain injury. Furthermore, previous studies have reported that NLRP3 inflammasome is mainly present in microglia, so we speculate that its activation may be strongly associated with microglial polarization.

Moreover, treatment with BAY 11-7082 restored tight junction alteration following IBS-D induction and reduced the restraint stress.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is regarded as one of the major agents during osteogenic differentiation in an inflammatory environment. miR-335-5p post-transcriptionally downregulates the Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (DKK1) protein level by specifically binding to the DKK1 3'UTR and activating Wnt signaling. The role of miR-335-5p in TNF-α-induced post-transcriptional regulation of DKK1 remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the mRNA and protein levels of DKK1 and the level of miR-335-5p were determined in MC3T3-E1 cells and the primary calvarial osteoblasts treated with or without TNF-α. The role of NF-κB signaling in TNF-α-induced post-transcriptional regulation of DKK1 was also evaluated. The present study determined that although TNF-α t reatment e xhibited c ell-specific effects on DKK1 mRNA expression, the stimulation of TNF-α time- and concentration-dependently upregulated the protein levels of DKK1. In primary calvarial osteoblasts, the decreased miR-335-5p level induced by TNF-α-activated NF-κB signaling served an important role in mediating the post-transcriptional regulation of DKK1 by TNF-α treatment. In MC3T3-E1 cells, the post-transcriptional regulation of DKK1 by TNF-α treatment was more complicated and involved other molecular signaling pathways in addition to the NF-κB signaling. In conclusion, TNF-α treatment served an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of DKK1 expression, which requires further investigation.

Inflammasome is widely studied in many autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory reactions, such as familial periodic autoinflammatory response, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and atherosclerosis. Activation of inflammasome in the kidney has been widely reported in glomerular and tubular-interstitial diseases. Podocytes play a critical role in maintaining the normal structure and function of glomerular filtration barrier. Recently, it has been demonstrated that podocytes, as a group of renal residential cells, can express all necessary components of NLRP3 inflammasome, which is activated and contribute to inflammatory response in the local kidney. Methods: Literature review was conducted to further summarize current evidence of podocyte NLRP3 inflammasome activation and related molecular mechanisms under different disease conditions. Results: Podocytes are a key component of the glomerular filtration barrier, and the loss of podocyte regeneration is a major limiting factor in the recovery of proteinuria.

Within the NLR members, NLRP3 is the most widely known and studied inflammasome and has been linked to many diseases. Nowadays, people’s interest in their lifestyles and nutritional habits is increasing, mainly due to the large number of diseases that seem to be related to both. The term “nutraceutical” has recently emerged as a hybrid term between “nutrition” and “pharmacological” and it refers to a wide range of bioactive compounds contained in food with relevant effects on human health. The relationship between these compounds and diseases based on inflammatory processes has been widely exposed and the compounds stand out as an alternative to the pathological consequences that inflammatory processes may have, beyond their defense and repair action. Against this backdrop, here we review the results of studies using several nutraceutical compounds in common diseases associated with the inflammation and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasomes complex.

At nanomolar concentration, disulfiram covalently modifies human/mouse Cys191/Cys192 in GSDMD to block pore formation. Disulfiram still allows IL-1β and GSDMD processing, but abrogates pore formation, thereby preventing IL-1β release and pyroptosis.

Diverse immune cell populations reside in adipose tissue, and their composition and immune responses vary with nutritional and environmental conditions. Adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by sterile low-grade chronic inflammation and excessive immune cell infiltration, is a hallmark of obesity, as well as an important link to cardiometabolic diseases. Amongst the pro-inflammatory factors secreted by the dysfunctional adipose tissue, interleukin (IL)-1β, induced by the NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, not only impairs peripheral insulin sensitivity, but it also interferes with the endocrine and immune functions of adipose tissue in a paracrine manner. Human studies indicated that NLRP3 activity in adipose tissues positively correlates with obesity and its metabolic complications, and treatment with the IL-1β antibody improves glycaemia control in type 2 diabetic patients. In mouse models, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of NLRP3 activation pathways or IL-1β prevents adipose tissue dysfunction, including inflammation, fibrosis, defective lipid handling and adipogenesis, which in turn alleviates obesity and its related metabolic disorders.

Mechanistically, pyroptosis can be categorized into canonical (mediated by caspase-1) and non-canonical (mediated by caspase-4/5/11). In canonical pyroptosis, Nod-like receptors (NLRs) inflammasomes play a critical role, and their activation promotes the maturation and secretion of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β/18 (IL-1β/18), cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD), and ultimately pyroptotic cell death.

Here, I review recent literature data on the mechanisms of Neuroinflammation in different CNS diseases and the role of plant-derived bioactive molecules in attenuating Neuroinflammation in these diseases. Research data indicate that CNS diseases are triggered by different pathological factors, which signal downstream, activating the NF-κB and NLRP3-inflammasome. Though CNS diseases have distinct pathophysiology, some tend to share similar neuropathogenic pathways. Notably, the neuroinflammatory sequelae of diabetes types I, II and III particularly appear to resemble critical aspects of the neuropathogenic pathways in multiple sclerosis (MS), suggesting that MS may be type 4 diabetes. Dozens of plant-derived chemicals have been identified to inhibit the molecular pathways of inflammation in CNS disorders.

Specifically, ACT001 significantly reduced motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neurodegeneration in MPTP-treated mice. Furthermore, ACT001 abolished MPTP-induced α-synuclein overexpression, astrocyte activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production in the substantia nigra and striatum of the mouse brain. In addition, ACT001 increased the levels of the anti-apoptotic signalling molecule Bcl-2 and the pAkt/Akt ratio and reduced the levels of the pro-apoptotic signalling molecule Bax and the activation of Caspase3 in the substantia nigra and striatum.

The disease is characterized by a tendency to spread over the area of lesion, and involvement of articular tissue in the pathological process, which significantly affects the living standards of patients and causes their disability. There are many provoking factors that contribute to occurrence of psoriasis, or progression of existing psoriatic process in individuals with a genetic predisposition. These factors include adverse climatic conditions, skin trauma, exposure to ultraviolet light, burns, infections, etc. This review describes the role of innate immunity in pathogenesis of psoriasis, and describes in detail the mechanisms involved into induction of inflammation of PAMPs and DAMPs. In psoriasis, positively charged catelicidin is considered one of the most important DAMPs, which can form a complex with negatively charged cell polyanions-LL-37/auto-RNA and LL-37/auto-DNA. The interaction of PAMP/DAMP ligands with specific PRR receptors leads to signal activation of effector components of immune system, i.e., assembly of inflammasome complex, caspase activation, synthesis of inflammatory cytokines and processing of their immature forms. The review focuses on the role of TLRs under the conditions of physiological norm, which recognize danger signals and provide protection from pathogens and their timely elimination, and in development of pathological process. Activation of TLRs induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferons and antimicrobial peptides, chemokines that support the development of psoriatic inflammation. In addition to TLRs, the mechanisms of involvement of inflammasomes in the development of psoriasis, which provides processing of mature forms of IL-1β and IL-18, are described in detail. Mature forms of these cytokines mediate the development of inflammation in psoriatic focus. In addition, processing of these cytokines by caspases using the positive feedback mechanism provides an additional signal to activate transcriptional activity of their genes and contributes to perpetuated inflammation. The review presents data confirming participation of inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Much attention is paid to description of pharmacological inhibitors of inflammasomes, which in the future may be the drugs of choice for treatment of inflammatory diseases. The study of molecular mechanisms of the innate immune system will reveal new approaches to prognosis and development of targeted therapy for psoriasis.",Inflammasome | Inflammation | Innate immunity | Psoriasis | Targeted therapy | Toll-like receptors,1,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2020-01

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) refers to temporary or permanent damage to brain function caused by penetrating objects or blunt force trauma. TBI activates inflammasome-mediated pathways and other cell death pathways to remove inactive and damaged cells, however, they are also harmful to the central nervous system. The newly discovered cell death pattern termed pyroptosis has become an area of interest. It mainly relies on caspase-1-mediated pathways, leading to cell death. Methods. Our research focus is VX765, a known caspase-1 inhibitor which may offer neuroprotection after the process of TBI. We established a controlled cortical impact (CCI) mouse model and then controlled the degree of pyroptosis in TBI with VX765. The effects of caspase-1 inhibition on inflammatory response, pyroptosis, blood-brain barrier (BBB), apoptosis, and microglia activation, in addition to neurological deficits, were investigated. Results. We found that TBI led to NOD-like receptors (NLRs) as well as absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis in the damaged cerebral cortex. VX765 curbed the expressions of indispensable inflammatory subunits (caspase-1 as well as key downstream proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-(IL-) 1β and IL-18). It also inhibited gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage and apoptosis-associated spot-like protein (ASC) oligomerization in the injured cortex. In addition to the above, VX765 also inhibited the inflammatory activity of the high-mobility cassette-1/Toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappa B (HMGB1/TLR4/NF-kappa B) pathway. By inhibiting pyroptosis and inflammatory mediator expression, we demonstrated that VX765 can decrease blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, apoptosis, and microglia polarization to exhibit its neuroprotective effects. Conclusion. In conclusion, VX765 can counteract neurological damage after TBI by reducing pyroptosis and HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB pathway activities.

Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is a safe, noninvasive treatment method to effectively inhibit inflammation and promote bone differentiation. However, the application of LIPUS in curing periodontitis is still rare. Our study aimed to explore the ability of LIPUS to inhibit inflammatory factors and promote the osteogenic differentiation capacity of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs), and its underlying mechanism. Material and Methods: Human periodontal ligament cells were obtained and cultured from the premolar tissue samples for experiments. First, hPDLCs were treated for 24 hours using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and then exposed to LIPUS (10 mW/cm2, 30 mW/cm2, 60 mW/cm2, and 90 mW/cm2) to determine the appropriate intensity to inhibit expression of the inflammatory factors interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression. The expression of IL-6 and IL-8 was detected by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The safety of the most appropriate intensity of LIPUS was tested by a cell counting kit 8 test and an apoptosis assay. Then, LPS-induced hPDLCs were treated in osteogenic medium for 7-21 days with or without LIPUS (90 mW/cm2, 30 min/d) stimulation. The osteogenic genes RUNX2, OPN, OSX, and OCN were measured by real-time PCR. Additionally, osteogenic differentiation capacity was determined using alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, ALP activity analysis, and Alizarin red staining. The activity of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway was determined by western blotting, real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and pathway blockade assays. Results: Lipopolysaccharide significantly upregulated the production and gene expression of IL-6 and IL-8, while LIPUS stimulation significantly inhibited IL-6 and IL-8 expression in an intensity-dependent manner. LIPUS (90 mW/cm2) was chosen as the most appropriate intensity, and there was no detrimental influence on cell proliferation and status with or without osteogenic medium. In addition, consecutive stimulation with LIPUS (90 mW/cm2) for 30 min/d for 7 days could also inhibit IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression, upregulate the expression of the osteogenesis-related genes RUNX2, OPN, OSX, and OCN, and promote osteogenic differentiation capacity in osteogenic medium in inflamed hPDLCs. The NF-κB signaling pathway was inhibited with LIPUS (90 mW/cm2) via inhibition of the phosphorylation of IκBα and the translocation of p65 into the nucleus in inflamed hPDLCs. Additional investigations of the NF-κB inhibitor, BAY 11-7082, revealed that LIPUS (90 mW/cm2) acted similarly to BAY 11-7802 to inhibit the NF-κB signaling pathway and increase osteogenesis-related genes and promote the osteogenic differentiation capacity of inflamed hPDLCs. Conclusion: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (90 mW/cm2) stimulation could be a safe method to inhibit IL-6 and IL-8 in hPDLCs by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway. The effect of LIPUS (90 mW/cm2) and BAY 11-7082 on LPS-induced inflammation demonstrated that both of these agents were capable of promoting osteogenesis-related gene expression and osteogenic differentiation in hPDLCs, suggesting that the effect of LIPUS on the promotion of osteogenic activity could be mediated in part through its ability to inhibit the NF-κB signal pathway. Hence, LIPUS could be a potential therapeutic method to cure periodontitis.",low-intensity pulsed ultrasound | NF-κB signal pathway | osteogenic capacity | periodontal inflammation,7,0,NSFC,KJ1500241,National Natural Science Foundation of China,citing papers,0,2020-01

We used molecular modeling guided by molecular dynamics simulations to design α-helical stapled peptides targeting the pyrin domain of the adaptor protein ASC to interrupt the development of its filament, which is crucial for NLRP3 inflammasome formation. The peptides were effectively internalized by human monocytic cells and efficiently suppressed the release of the inflammasome-regulated cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, following exogenous activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The peptides reduced ASC speck formation and caspase-1 processing thereby suppressing pro-IL-1β processing and release of active IL-1β.

In immunosuppressed individuals and fetus, infection with T. gondii contributes to a series of devastating conditions, including toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE), which is characterized by neuron damage in the central nervous system (CNS). Astrocyte polarization is currently found in some neurodegenerative diseases, and A1 subtype of astrocyte leads to neuron apoptosis. However, little information has been available on the role of astrocyte polarization in TE. Methods: In the present study, we established a mouse model to study TE and detected A1 astrocyte in the brains of mice with TE. Expression level of A1 astrocyte-specific marker C3 was evaluated using indirect fluorescent assay (IFA) and Western blotting. Primary mouse astrocytes were incubated with different concentrations of T. gondii excreted-secreted antigens (TgESAs) in vitro. Expression level of C3 and A1 astrocyte-specific transcription levels were assessed using Western blotting and qRT-PCR, respectively. Bay11-7082 was used to study nuclear factor (NF) κB pathway in TgESA-induced astrocyte polarization. Results: In mice with TE, the proportion of A1 astrocyte (GFAP+C3+) increased significantly. The results of in vitro study showed that TgESAs induced astrocyte polarization to A1 subtype. Blocking of NFκB pathway by Bay11-7082 inhibited TgESA-induced astrocyte polarization. Conclusions: Our preliminary study showed the involvement of A1 astrocyte in the process of TE in mice, and TgESAs could trigger astrocyte to polarize to A1 subtype.

In subsequent examinations, P-linked ATP Sepharose was used as an enrichment tool to enable the effective profiling of NLRP3-biomarker signatures with selected reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (SRM-MS).

An obesity-induced inflammatory response was induced in various co-culture systems using adipocytes (3T3-L1) and macrophages (RAW264.7) in vitro and the effect of PL and its mechanism of action were determined. PL effectively suppressed the adiposity-induced inflammatory responses by downregulating IL-6 (40–42%) and MCP-1 (26–37%) in 3T3-CM-cultured macrophages and contact co-culture system. PL also favorably regulated the dysregulations of adiponectin and resistin in macrophage-conditioned medium (RAW-CM)-cultured adipocytes. In transwell system of adipocyte and macrophage, PL was shown to upregulated Nrf2 and its target molecule, HO-1 by promoting nuclear translocation of Nrf2.

The current study aimed to identify food-borne exosome-like nanoparticles (ELNs) that inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity. Nine vegetables or fruits were selected to extract ELNs, which were examined for their inhibitory effects on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in primary macrophages. Although most of the tested ELNs posed minimal impacts, the ELNs from ginger rhizomes (G-ELNs) strongly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The G-ELNs contained lipids, proteins, and RNAs and were easily taken up by macrophages. G-ELN treatment suppressed pathways downstream of inflammasome activation including caspase1 autocleavage, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 secretion, and pyroptotic cell death. Apoptotic speck protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) oligomerization and speck formation assays indicated that G-ELNs blocked assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The lipids in G-ELNs, rather than the RNAs or proteins, were responsible for the inhibitory activity observed.

However, the mechanism of miR-21 in LPS-induced septic shock is still unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of miR-21 in LPS-induced pyroptosis and septic shock. Here, we show that miR-21 deficiency inhibited NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 expression, as well as inflammasome activation in myeloid cells from both mice and humans. We found that the NF-κB pathway was regulated by miR-21, and that A20 was a direct target of miR-21. Furthermore, miR-21 deficiency inhibited the ASC pyroptosome, which restrained caspase-1 activation and GSDMD cleavage, thereby preventing LPS-induced pyroptosis and septic shock. miR-21 deficiency resulted in an increase in A20, which led to decreased IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation. Caspase-1-mediated GSDMD cleavage was consequently decreased, which prevented pyroptosis in LPS-induced sepsis in mice. Our results demonstrate that miR-21 is a critical positive regulator of the NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasomes in pyroptosis and septic shock via A20. In addition, by analyzing published miRNA expression profiles in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we found that the miR-21 levels in peripheral blood from patients with septic shock were elevated. Thus, miR-21 may serve as a potential treatment target in patients with septic shock.",,35,1,NSFC,31600730,National Natural Science Foundation of China,citing papers,0,2019-06

First-line treatment involves rapid reperfusion. However, a highly dynamic and co-ordinated inflammatory response is rapidly mounted to repair and remove the injured cells which, paradoxically, can further exacerbate myocardial injury. Furthermore, although cardiac remodelling may initially preserve some function to the heart, it can lead over time to adverse remodelling and eventually heart failure. Since the size of the infarct corresponds to the subsequent risk of developing heart failure, it is important to find ways to limit initial infarct development. In this review, we focus on the role of the innate immune system in the acute response to ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) and specifically its contribution to cell death and myocardial infarction. Numerous danger-associated molecular patterns are released from dying cells in the myocardium, which can stimulate pattern recognition receptors including toll like receptors and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in resident cardiac and immune cells. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase 1, and pyroptosis may ensue, particularly when the myocardium has been previously aggravated by the presence of comorbidities. Evidence will be discussed that suggests agents targeting innate immunity may be a promising means of protecting the hearts of STEMI patients against acute IR injury. However, the dosing and timing of such agents should be carefully determined because innate immunity pathways may also be involved in cardioprotection.

This study aimed to investigate ability of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) on promoting the osteoclastic differentiation of osteoclast precursors and clarify mechanisms underlying this process in vitro. SHED and dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) were obtained from deciduous teeth and healthy permanent teeth. An indirect co-culture system of SHED or DPSCs were used. The osteoclast precursor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were established. Ability of SHED and DPSCs in promoting osteoclastogenesis was determined using triiodothyronine receptor auxiliary protein (TRAP) staining, real-time real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and western blotting. The effect of inflammation on the pro-osteoclastogenesis ability of SHED was determined using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), RT-PCR and western blotting. The function of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway in promoting the osteoclastogenesis ability of SHED was determined using RT-PCR and western blotting. SHED exhibited an increased ability to promote osteoclastic differentiation. Expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was significantly higher in SHED than in DPSCs.

Emerging studies have demonstrated that Genistein, a major isoflavone, has potential anti-inflammatory effects in murine model colitis. However, its anti-inflammatory mechanism remains unclear. The effects of Genistein in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced murine colitis via targeting NLRP3 inflammasome was investigated in this study. Also, the mechanisms of protective action of Genistein in DSS-induced colitis may relate to TGR5 signaling. Genistein treatment not only remarkably attenuated loss of body weight and shortening of colon length but also significantly reduced inflammatory cells infiltration and pro-inflammatory mediator production in serum and colon. Moreover, Genistein treatment down-regulated production of caspase-1 and IL-1β and increased intracellular cAMP level, which were similar to the treatment for INT-777, a semi-synthetic TGR5 agonist, in phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells and U937 cells. These protective effects of Genistein might be attributed by ubiquination of NLRP3 which was induced due to interaction of cAMP with NLRP3. Furthermore, the effects of Genistein on NLRP3 inflammasome disappeared in TGR5-silenced U937 cells.

However, there are few reports describing relationships between inflammasomes and autophagy in HCC therapy. The present study demonstrated that DHA suppressed cell proliferation in HepG2215 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibitory activity is mediated by autophagy, in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage. Then, DHA were first shown to promote AIM2/caspase-1 inflammasome. Compared with the DHA group, the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA significantly inhibited the expressions of activated Caspase-1, a pyroptotic marker proteins. Meanwhile, repression of mTOR by rapamycin promoted autophagy and AIM2/caspase-1 activation. The caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK also notably blocked autophagy cell death characterized by the downexpression of Beclin-1 and LC3-II. Additionally, the study demonstrated that DHA suppressed pseudopodium formation and cell mobility.

Podophyllotoxin and rutin in combination (G-003M) has been reported to regulate endogenous cellular antioxidant defense systems and inflammatory response. However, the mechanism by which G-003M ameliorates radiation-induced intestinal stem cell (ISC) injury remains unclear. Here, we hypothesize the radioprotective potential of G-003M would amplify the intestinal crypt stem cells through upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and accelerate the reconstitution of the irradiated intestine. Our results showed significant functional and structural intestine regeneration in irradiated animals following G-003M treatment which resulted in improved animal survival. Immunohistochemical examination revealed an enhancement in Lgr5 + ve crypt stem cells. Increased β-catenin nuclear translocation resulted in upregulation of β-catenin target genes that supported ISC renewal and expansion in G-003M-treated mice, as compared to IR-treated mice. However, G-003M could not rescue the Wnt knockdown cohorts (XAV939 treated) which exhibited greater incidence of intestinal apoptosis, DNA damage and crypt depopulation upon radiation exposure. These findings suggest the involvement of Wnt pathway during G-003M mediated amelioration of IR-induced ISC injury. G-003M also minimised acute inflammation by restricting the infiltration of immune cells into the intestinal venules.

We used mouse lung epithelial cell lines and an alveolar macrophage cell line in the presence of a binary PAH mixture (1:1 ratio of fluoranthene and 1-methylanthracene; PAH mixture). Parthenolide, a pan-inflammation inhibitor, reversed the PAH-induced inhibition of GJIC, the decreased CX43 expression, and the induction of KC and TNF. To further determine the direct role of a cytokine in regulating GJIC, recombinant TNF (rTNF) was used to inhibit GJIC and this response was further enhanced in the presence of the PAH mixture. Collectively, these findings support a role for inflammation in regulating GJIC and the potential to target these early stage cancer pathways for therapeutics.",Epithelial cells | Gap junctions | Inflammation | Lung | Macrophages | Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons | Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) | Tumor promotion,12,1,NIH,R15ES024893,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2019-04

There is no study on whether proanthocyanidin could protect against arsenic-induced respiratory inflammatory damage. The aim of the study is to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of proanthocyanidin and the molecular mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. BEAS-2B cells were treated with As2O3, grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), and/or BAY 11–7082. Kunming mice were treated with As2O3 and/or GSPE. p-IκB-α, IκB-α, IKKα/β, NF-κBp65, and NF-κBp50 were assessed by Western blot and qRT-PCR. Lung histology was examined. Arsenic affected the histology of the mouse lungs, but GSPE attenuated those effects. As2O3 increased cell apoptosis, which was reversed by GSPE. In cells and mouse lung tissue, arsenic increased the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein, and these effects were attenuated by GSPE. In cells and mouse lung tissue, arsenic enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of IKKα, IKKβ, NF-κBp65, and NF-κBp50, while the IκB-α levels were decreased compared with controls. IKKα, IKKβ, NF-κBp65, and NF-κBp50 mRNA and protein levels in the As2O3+GSPE groups were lower and IκB-α levels were higher than that in the arsenic groups. Arsenic-activated NF-κB signaling induced inflammatory damage through the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. GSPE plays a beneficial role against arsenic-induced inflammatory damage through, at least in part, the suppression of the arsenic-induced NF-κB signaling pathway. Impact statement: Arsenic-induced respiratory inflammatory damage is an important occupational hazard in many areas of the world, particularly in underdeveloped and developing countries. Effective treatments are lacking and expensive. Therefore, the aim of the study was to examine the anti-inflammatory effects of proanthocyanidin (PC) and the molecular mechanisms in vivo and in vitro. The present study showed that PC extracted from grape seed could attenuate the lung damage in a mouse model of arsenic poisoning. The effects were observed at the level of lung histology and inflammasome expression. This study suggests that a natural compound is effective in mitigating the toxic effects of arsenic in the lungs, providing an inexpensive and more readily accessible method for treating arsenic exposure in some parts of the world.",Arsenic | lung injury | nuclear factor κB | proanthocyanidin,7,0,,81560517,National Natural Science Foundation of China,citing papers,0,2019-03

This study therefore aimed to uncover functional feed additives to help enhance livestock immunity and disease resistance, using Acanthopanax sessiliflorus fruit extract (ASF). Methods: ASF was extracted with 70% EtOH, and total polyphenolic and catechin contents were measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu and vanillin assay, respectively. The 3D4/31 porcine macrophage cells (MΦ) were activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and cell survival and growth rate were measured with or without ASF treatment. Flow-cytometric analysis determined the lysosomal activity, reactive oxygen species levels (ROS), and cell cycle distribution. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) protein expression levels were quantified by western blotting and densitometry analysis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was applied to measure the lipid metabolism-related genes expression level. Lastly, the antibacterial activity of 3D4/31 MΦ cells was evaluated by the colony forming unit assay. Results: ASF upregulated the cell viability and growth rate of 3D4/31 MΦ, with or without PMA activation. Moreover, lysosomal activity and intracellular ROS levels were increased after ASF exposure. In addition, the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 expression levels were proportionately increased with ROS levels. Both ASF and PMA treatment resulted in upregulation of NF-κB protein, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α mRNA expression levels, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation metabolism. Interestingly, co-treatment of ASF with PMA resulted in recovery of NF-κB, TNFα, and lipid metabolism levels. Finally, ASF pretreatment enhanced the in vitro bactericidal activity of 3D4/31 MΦ against Escherichia coli. Conclusion: This study provides a novel insight into the regulation of NF-κB activity and lipid metabolism in MΦ, and we anticipate that ASF has the potential to be effective as a feed additive to enhance livestock immunity.",Acanthopanax sessiliflorus | Feed Additives | Immunity | Macrophages | Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) | Porcine,3,1,RDA,undefined,Rural Development Administration,citing papers,0,2019-01

By far, the best studied and most characterized inflammasome is NLRP3 inflammasome, which consists of NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) and pyrin domain containing receptor 3), ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), and procaspase-1. Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is mediated by highly diverse stimuli. Upon activation, NLRP3 protein recruits the adapter ASC protein, which recruits the procaspase-1 resulting in its cleavage and activation, inducing the maturation, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines and pyroptosis. However, aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is implicated in various diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases; raising a tremendous clinical interest in exploring the potential inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasome. Recent investigations have disclosed various inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway which were validated through in vitro studies and in vivo experiments in animal models of NLRP3-associated disorders. Some of these inhibitors directly target the NLRP3 protein whereas some are aimed at other components and products of the inflammasome. Direct targeting of NLRP3 protein can be a better choice because it can prevent off target immunosuppressive effects, thus restrain tissue destruction.

Using this assay, we evaluated ca. 40,000 molecules and identified 59 initial hits as possible Tat inhibitors. Since phospholipase C is exported into the periplasm by Tat, and subsequently translocated across the outer membrane by the type II secretion system (T2SS), our assay could also identify T2SS inhibitors. To validate our hits and discriminate between compounds that inhibited either Tat or T2SS, two separate counter assays were developed and optimized. Finally, three Tat inhibitors and one T2SS inhibitor were confirmed by means of dose-response analysis and additional counter and confirming assays. Although none of the identified inhibitors was suitable as a lead compound for drug development, this study validates our assay as a simple, efficient, and HTS compatible method for the identification of Tat and T2SS inhibitors.",High-throughput screening | Phospholipase C | Pseudomonas aeruginosa | Twin arginine translocase | Type II secretion | Virulence inhibitors,5,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2019-01

Taking in account that several cytoplasmic receptors are able to activate inflammasome, and that bacterial components are considered as a novel and efficient adjuvant, we postulated that bacterial flagellin (FLG), a natural ligand of NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome, could rescue the activation of the complex in HIV-DC. Objective: Demonstrate that FLG is able to activate monocyte-derived dendritic cells from HIV-infected individuals better than LPS, and to what extent the entity of inflammasome activation differs between DC from HIV-infected patients and healthy donors. Methods: Monocyte-derived dendritic cells from HIV-infected patients (HIV-DC) and healthy donors (HD-DC) were stimulated with FLG, and inflammasome as well as DC activation (phenotypic profile, cytokine production, autologous lymphocytes activation) were compared. Chemical and genetic inhibitors were used to depict the relative contribution of NLRC4 and NLRP3 in HIV/HD-DC response to FLG. Results: FLG properly activates HD-DC and HIV-DC. FLG induces higher inflammasome activation than LPS in HIV-DC. FLG acts through NLRC4 and NLRP3 in HD-DC, but at a lesser extent in HIV-DC due to intrinsic NLRP3 defect.

NLRP3 is a central component of NLRP3 inflammasome and has been involved in a wide variety of chronic inflammation-driven human diseases. Here, we show that Ori is a specific and covalent inhibitor for NLRP3 inflammasome. Ori forms a covalent bond with the cysteine 279 of NLRP3 in NACHT domain to block the interaction between NLRP3 and NEK7, thereby inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation.

Our results thus identify NLRP3 as the direct target of Ori for mediating Ori's anti-inflammatory activity.

The innate immune response plays an important role in various brain injuries, including stroke, and targeting it for therapeutic interventions would likely prove beneficial. The panoply of inflammatory cells, which induce various cellular, hormonal, and biochemical alterations, mediates the rapid progression of injury in stroke. The inflammasome, a multiprotein oligomer and a key component of specific innate immune responses, contributes toward the worsening of stroke outcomes by activating inflammatory cytokines. Acidotoxicity, mediated by acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), also contributes toward exacerbating the condition. A role for ASICs in stroke, through the activation of the inflammasome, is emerging, which opens new avenues for understanding and intervening in stroke. In this review, we describe the various types of inflammasomes and their mechanisms of activation in stroke. Furthermore, therapeutic approaches targeting the inflammasome and that may be helpful in improving stroke outcome are discussed.",Acid-sensing ion channel | Inflammasome | Neuroprotection | Stroke,10,0,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2018-11

Trans-Chalcone (1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-one) is a flavonoid precursor presenting biological activities such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant proprieties. Thus, the aim of this work was to evaluate the protective effects of trans-Chalcone in experimental gout arthritis in mice. Mice were treated with trans-Chalcone (3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, per oral) or vehicle (Tween 80 20% plus saline) 30 min before intra-articular injection of MSU (100 μg/knee joint, intra-articular). We observed that trans-Chalcone inhibited MSU-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, edema, and leukocyte recruitment (total leukocytes, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells) in a dose-dependent manner. Trans-Chalcone also decreased inflammatory cell recruitment as observed in Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and the intensity of fluorescence of LysM-eGFP+ cells in the confocal microscopy. Trans-Chalcone reduced MSU-induced oxidative stress as observed by an increase in the antioxidant defense [Glutathione (GSH), Ferric Reducing (FRAP), and 2,2′-Azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonic acid (ABTS assays)] and reduction in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species production [superoxide anion (NBT assay) and nitrite (NO assay)]. Furthermore, it reduced in vivo MSU-induced interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-6 production, and increased Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) production. Importantly, trans-Chalcone reduced nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation and thereby the mRNA expression of the inflammasome components Nlrp3 (cryopyrin), Asc (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), Pro-caspase-1 and Pro-IL-1β. In vitro, trans-Chalcone reduced the MSU-induced release of IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages.

Recently, accumulating evidence has indicated that disturbances in the inflammatory response system not only provoke autoimmune disorders, but also can have deleterious effects on neuronal function and mental health. As inflammation in the brain is primarily mediated by microglia, there has been an expanding focus on the mechanisms through which these cells initiate and propagate neuroinflammation. Microglia can enter persistently active states upon their initial recognition of an environmental stressor and are thereafter prone to elicit amplified and persistent inflammatory responses following subsequent exposures to stressors. A recent focus on why primed microglia cells are susceptible to environmental insults has been the NLRP3 inflammasome. Its function within the innate immune system is regulated in such a manner that supports a role for the complex in gating neuroinflammatory responses. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia results in the cleavage of zymogen inflammatory interleukins into functional forms that elicit a number of consequential effects in the local neuronal environment. There is evidence to support the principle that within primed neuroimmune systems a lowered threshold for NLRP3 activation can cause persistent neuroinflammation or the amplified production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18. Over the course of an individual's lifetime, persistent neuroinflammation can subsequently lead to the pathophysiological signatures that define psychological disorders. Therefore, targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome complex may represent an innovative and consequential approach to limit neuroinflammatory states in psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder.",Immune priming | Innate immune system | Microglia | NLRP3 inflammasome | Psychiatric disorders,33,0,NIH,P50 AT008661-01,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2018-10

It is a painful inflammatory disease induced by the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joints and peri-articular tissues. Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are secondary metabolite biosynthesized mainly by species from the family Asteraceae. It has been demonstrated that SLs present anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antitumoral, antiparasitic, and antimicrobial activities. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the SL budlein A in a model of acute gout arthritis in mice. Methods: Experiments were conducted in male Swiss or male LysM-eGFP mice. Animals were treated with budlein A (1 or 10 mg/kg) or vehicle 30 min before stimulus with MSU (100 μg/10 μL, intra-articular). Knee joint withdrawal threshold and edema were evaluated using electronic von Frey and caliper, respectively, 1-15 h after MSU injection. Leukocyte recruitment was determined by counting cells (Neubauer chamber), H&E staining, and using LysM-eGFP mice by confocal microscopy. Inflammasome components, Il-1β, and TNF-α mRNA expression were determined by RT-qPCR. IL-1β and TNF-α production (in vitro) and NF-κB activation (in vitro and in vivo) were evaluated by ELISA. In vitro analysis using LPS-primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) was performed 5 h after stimulation with MSU crystals. For these experiments, BMDMs were either treated or pre-treated with budlein A at concentrations of 1, 3, or 10 μg/mL. Results: We demonstrated that budlein A reduced mechanical hypersensitivity and knee joint edema. Moreover, it reduced neutrophil recruitment, phagocytosis of MSU crystals by neutrophils, and Il-1β and TNF-α mRNA expression in the knee joint. In vitro, budlein A decreased TNF-α production, which might be related to the inhibition of NF-κB activation. Furthermore, budlein A also reduced the IL-1β maturation, possibly by targeting inflammasome assembly in macrophages. Conclusion: Budlein A reduced pain and inflammation in a model of acute gout arthritis in mice. Therefore, it is likely that molecules with the ability of targeting NF-κB activation and inflammasome assembly, such as budlein A, are interesting approaches to treat gout flares.",Analgesia | Experimental arthritis | Gout treatment | Joint pain | Knee pain | NLRP3 inflammasome | Rheumatic disease | Sesquiterpene lactones,15,1,FAPESP,2013/08216-2,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,citing papers,0,2018-09

Wistar rats received melamine (Mel; 200 mg·kg body wt-1·day-1), cyanuric acid (CA; 200 mg·kg body wt-1·day-1), or Mel plus CA (Mel + CA; 100 mg·kg body wt-1·day-1, each) for 2 wk. Mel + CA caused damaged tubular epithelial structure and organelles, dilated tubular lumen, and inflammatory responses. Crystals were observed in urine and serum specimen, also in the lumen of dilated distal renal tubules. The combined ingestion of Mel and CA in rats caused a markedly impaired urinary concentration, which was associated with reduced protein expression of aquaporin (AQP)1, 2, and 3 in inner medulla and α-Na-K-ATPase and Na-K-2Cl transporters in cortex and outer medulla.

Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) are rare autoinflammatory diseases, comprising a broad disease spectrum with varying severity. CAPS are associated with GOF mutations in the NLRP3 inflammasome and activation of IL-1ß leading to episodes of fever, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, articular, ocular, and neurological symptoms.

They commonly assemble around a cytoplasmic receptor of the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat containing receptor (NLR) family, although other cytoplasmic receptors like pyrin have been shown to form inflammasomes. The nucleation of the multiprotein scaffolding platform occurs upon detection of a microbial, a danger or a homeostasis pattern by the receptor that will, most commonly, associate with the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) through homotypic domain interactions resulting in recruitment of procaspase-1. This will lead to the autoproteolytic activation of caspase-1, which regulates the secretion of proinflammatory IL1β and IL18 cytokines and pyroptosis, a caspase-1-mediated form of cell death. Pyroptosis occurs through cleavage of Gasdermin D, a membrane pore forming protein. Recently, non-canonical inflammasomes have been described, which directly sense intracellular pathogens through caspase-4 and -5 in humans, leading to pyroptosis. Inflammasomes are important in host defense; however, a deregulated activity is associated with a number of inflammatory, immune and metabolic disorders. Furthermore, mutations in inflammasome receptor coding genes are causal for an increasing number of rare autoinflammatory diseases. Biotherapies targeting the products of inflammasome activation as well as molecules that directly or indirectly inhibit inflammasome nucleation and activation are promising therapeutic areas. This review discusses recent advances in inflammasome biology, the molecular pathology of several inflammasomes, and current therapeutic approaches in autoinflammatory diseases and in selected common multifactorial inflammasome-mediated disorders.",Autoinflammation | Cytokines | Inflammasomes | Pyrin | Pyroptosis,53,0,NHLBI,FDT20130928419,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",citing papers,0,2018-07

Naringin exhibits anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation effects among others, but its specific mechanisms are not clear. We investigated the expression of the NLRP3-inflammasome under high-glucose conditions, assessed the effects of naringin on that process, and further elucidated the role of naringin in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease(DKD). Methods: To assess the therapeutic potential of naringin and the mechanisms involved, we cultured rat glomerular mesangial cells and grouped them according to different glucose concentrations, different action times, different concentrations of MCC950, and different concentrations of naringin.The cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The expression of Interleukin-1β(IL-1β) and Interleukin18 (IL-18) in the cell supernatant were detected by ELISA. The expression and activity of NLPR3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and Caspase-1 were detected by Western Blot. Results: The expressions of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 in rat glomerular mesangial cells were significantly higher in the high glucose (HG) group than in the control normal glucose (NG) group and exhibited time-dependence activity. The expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 in different treatment groups were significantly lower compared with the HG group after 48 h of MCC950 pre-treatment (p < 0.05). Pre-treatment with naringin produced the same results. Naringin also inhibited the proliferation of cells. Conclusions: The NLRP3-inflammasome potentially plays a role in the process of activation and inflammation of glomerular mesangial cells as induced by high-glucose conditions. Naringin inhibited the proliferation of cells that were induced by high glucose. Further, it reduced the expression of inflammatory factors that are mediated by NLRP3 through the NLRP3-caspase-1-IL-1β/IL-18 signaling pathway, which makes naringin a potentially novel treatment for DKD disease.",Diabetes mellitus | Diabetic kidney disease | Naringin | NLRP3 inflammasome | NLRP3-caspase-1-IL-1β/IL-18 signaling pathway,17,1,,L2015564,,citing papers,0,2018-06

Inflammation can be either acute or chronic. In the acute phase, in the early stages of inflammation, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells contribute to cytokine production that spreads the inflammatory events. Although inflammation has a protective role, many diseases have the etiological origin in inflammatory processes such as atherosclerosis, arthritis, cancer, and ischemic heart disease. There are many pathways involving the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory mediators. In this chapter we analyze different intracellular signaling routes related to inflammation. There are two principal types of anti-inflammatory drugs, namely, steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which reduce inflammation by binding to cortisol receptors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which decrease damage by inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes. These anti-inflammatory drugs entail many risks, in particular, gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding, and hep-atotoxicity.

Immunoprecipitation and FRET analysis demonstrated that OLT1177 prevented NLRP3-ASC, as well as NLRP3-caspase-1 interaction, thus inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome oligomerization. In a cell-free assay, OLT1177 reduced ATPase activity of recombinant NLRP3, suggesting direct targeting of NLRP3. Mechanistically, OLT1177 did not affect potassium efflux, gene expression, or synthesis of the IL-1β precursor. Steady-state levels of phosphorylated NF-κB and IkB kinase were significantly lowered in spleen cells from OLT1177-treated mice. We observed reduced IL-1β content in tissue homogenates, limited oxidative stress, and increased muscle oxidative metabolism in OLT1177-treated mice challenged with LPS. Healthy humans receiving 1,000 mg of OLT1177 daily for 8 d exhibited neither adverse effects nor biochemical or hematological changes.",Caspase-1 | Interleukin-1 | NLRP3,145,1,NIH,R56AI015614,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2018-02

However, it remains unclear as to how such diverse stimuli individually generate a common inflammatory process. Jürg Tschopp provided substantial insight into this conundrum when, working with extracts from THP-1 cells, he reported the existence of the inflammasome. He described it as a structure that senses multiple diverse signals from intracellular/extracellular sources and pathogens and triggers inflammation by the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18. Recently, many of these sensors were found in the bladder and the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3, has been shown to be a central mediator of inflammation in several urological diseases. In this review, we introduce the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domaincontaining-3 inflammasome, highlight its emerging role in several common urologic conditions, and speculate on the potential involvement of other inflammasomes in bladder pathology.",Bladder cancer | Bladder outlet obstruction | Inflammasomes | NLRP3 | Urinary tract infection | Urothelial carcinoma,11,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2018-02

Ischemic stroke increases the expression and activation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) Pyrin domain containing 1 and 3 (NLRP1 and NLRP3) inflammasome proteins and both interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 in neurons. In this study, we provide evidence that activation of either the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways was partly responsible for inducing the expression and activation of NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasome proteins and that these effects can be attenuated using pharmacological inhibitors of these two pathways in neurons and brain tissue under in vitro and in vivo ischemic conditions, respectively. Moreover, these findings provided supporting evidence that treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) preparation can reduce activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways resulting in decreased expression and activation of NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes, as well as increasing expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, in primary cortical neurons and/or cerebral tissue under in vitro and in vivo ischemic conditions. In summary, these results provide compelling evidence that both the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways play a pivotal role in regulating the expression and activation of NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in primary cortical neurons and brain tissue under ischemic conditions. In addition, treatment with IVIg preparation decreased the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, and thus attenuated the expression and activation of NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in primary cortical neurons under ischemic conditions.

Some of these receptors directly bind microbial ligands, while others recognize endogenous molecules exposed under stress conditions, including infections. Most of these receptors can be engaged by a relatively limited number of stimuli. Differently, NLRP3 acts as a broad sensor of cell homeostasis rupture and can be activated downstream of a plethora of stimuli. NLRP3 then assembles a multiprotein platform resulting in caspase-1 activation, which controls, by direct cleavage, the maturation of cytosolic pro-cytokines including pro-interleukin-1β. In addition, caspase-1 processes cytosolic gasdermin-D and unleashes its pore-forming N-terminal domain, leading to the release of mature cytosolic cytokines and alarmins, as well as pyroptotic cell lysis. Accumulating evidences of the aggravating role of NLRP3-mediated inflammation in various highly prevalent human conditions, including diabetes, neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases, raises a huge clinical interest. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism governing NLRP3 activation remains insufficiently understood. In line with the detrimental consequences of NLRP3 activation illustrated by the aforementioned pathologies, this process is tightly regulated. In this review, we address the current understanding of the control of NLRP3 activity which can be divided into two coordinated processes referred to as priming and activation. In particular, we detail the emerging role of NLRP3 post-translational modifications critical in inflammasome assembly regulation.",Inflammasome | Inflammation | NLRP3 | Post-translational modifications,97,1,FP7,616986,Seventh Framework Programme,citing papers,0,2018-01

A well-known example is parthenolide, a sesquiterpene lactone produced by superficial leaf glands. While parthenolide is mainly isolated from the feverfew plant Tanacetum parthenium L. (syn. Chrysanthemum parthenium), it can also be found in other species from the Daisy family (Asteraceae species), such as German Chamomile. In European traditional medicine, feverfew has been widely used for the treatment of migraine and rheumatism. It is now recommended as a migraine prophylactic since clinical trials have confirmed its effectiveness against headaches and migraine. Headache has been associated with a predisposed sensitivity of neurovascular reactions to certain stimuli in the central nervous system, with serotonin (5-HT) being the most implicated neurotransmitter in migraine pathophysiology. Drugs that are serotonin antagonists are used in migraine prevention (e.g., methysergide, a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid). It has been suggested that parthenolide is a low-affinity antagonist at 5-HT receptors. The 5-HT receptor is the target of many different therapeutic agents and abused drugs. Recent studies have shown that parthenolide inhibits cocaine-induced behaviors in an animal model, suggesting that parthenolide could have potential use as an overdose antidote or therapeutic agent to treat cocaine intoxication. Cocaine is an addictive drug because of the way that it exploits the dopaminergic neural pathways, and its effect on the body is experienced as a sense of euphoria in human subjects. Cocaine also affects serotonin transporters. Because dopamine and serotonin are both associated with motivation, pleasure, and reward, cocaine is an extremely addictive substance. This review will focus on exploring the properties and mechanisms of action of parthenolide: (1) as a migraine prophylactic, (2) as a cytotoxic/anticancer agent, and (3) as a specific behavioral antagonist of cocaine as a possible treatment for cocaine addiction.",Anticancer activity | Migraine prophylactic | Parthenolide | Sesquiterpene lactone | Terpenoid,1,0,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2018-01

The purpose of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of A. lappa extract (ALE) on NLRP3 inflammasome activation and explore the underlying mechanisms. We found that ALE inhibited IL-1β secretion from NLRP3 inflammasome activated bone marrow derived macrophages but not that secreted by NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes activation. Mechanistic studies revealed that ALE suppressed the ATPase activity of purified NLRP3 and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) generated during NLRP3 activation. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of ALE on NLRP3 inflammasome might be attributed to its ability to inhibit the NLRP3 ATPase function and attenuated the mROS during inflammasome activation. In addition, ALE significantly reduced the LPS-induced increase of plasma IL-1β in mouse peritonitis model.

Methods Male SD rats in a SPF grade were randomly divided into five groups: control group (9-month-old rats), model group (24-month-old rats), and SPJ treatment group (10, 30, and 60 mg/kg). From the beginning of 18 months, animals were treated with SPJ (or normal saline) by ig until 24 months, and stopped 2 d each week for six months of continuous administration. The neural apoptosis situation of cortex and hippocampus in aging rats were observed by TUNEL method. The protein expression of IL-1β, ASC, NLRP3, NLRP1, Caspase-1, and IL-18 of the cerebral cortex and hippocampal were detected by Western blotting. Results TUNEL results showed that there were a very small number of apoptotic cells in the cortex and hippocampus in control group. Compared with control group, the model group significantly increased the number of apoptotic cells. Compared with model group, the number of apoptotic cells was significantly decreased in rat cortex and hippocampus (CA1, CA3, and DG) after treated with SPJ (10, 30, and 60 mg/kg).

BOT-4-one exhibited an inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which was attributable to its alkylating capability to NLRP3. In particular, the NLRP3 alkylation by BOT-4-one led to an impaired ATPase activity of NLRP3, thereby obstructing the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Additionally, we found that NLRP3 alkylators, including BOT-4-one, enhance the ubiquitination level of NLRP3, which might also contribute to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, BOT-4-one appeared to be superior to other known NLRP3 alkylators in inhibiting the functionality of the NLRP3 inflammasome and its resulting anti-inflammatory activity was confirmed in vivo using a monosodium urate-induced peritonitis mouse model. Collectively, the results suggest that NLRP3 alkylators function by inhibiting ATPase activity and increasing the ubiquitination level of NLRP3, and BOT-4-one could be the type of NLRP3 inhibitor that may be potentially useful for the novel development of a therapeutic agent in controlling NLRP3 inflammasome-related diseases.",,34,1,NRF,2016-A419-0098,National Research Foundation of Korea,citing papers,0,2017-12

Emerging evidence indicates that intracellular inflammasome complex namely NLRP3 complex is involved in the recognition and execution of host inflammatory response. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that NLRP3 inflammasome activation is linked to rotenone (ROT)-induced microglial activation which is dependent upon a priming stimulus by a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) or damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP), respectively. Herein using both BV2 cells and primary microglial cells, we show that LPS priming and subsequent ROT stimulation enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, c-Abl and PKCδ activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, NF-κB activation, and autophagic markers, while TFEB levels were decreased dramatically. Mechanistic studies revealed c-Abl acts as a proximal signal that exacerbated the activation of the afore mentioned markers. Intriguingly, siRNA-mediated depletion or pharmacological inhibition of c-Abl via dasatinib abrogated LPS and ROT-induced microglial activation response via attenuation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, mitochondrial oxidative stress, and ALS dysfunction. Moreover, mitoTEMPO, a mitochondrial antioxidant, attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation effects via blockade of c-Abl and PKCδ activation. In LPS treated mice, dasatinib attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, c-Abl and PKCδ activation; and sickness behavior. Together our findings identify an exaggerated ROS/c-Abl/NLRP3 signaling axis in the heightened microglial activation response evidenced in LPS-primed ROT-stimulated microglial cells and suggest that targeting c-Abl-regulated NLRP3 inflammasome signaling offers a novel therapeutic strategy for PD treatment.

In this article, we identified an E3 ligase, Ariadne homolog 2 (ARIH2), as a posttranslational negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activity in macrophages. ARIH2 interacted with NLRP3 via its NACHT domain (aa 220-575) in the NLRP3 inflammasome complex. In particular, we found that while using mutants of ARIH2 and ubiquitin, the really interesting new gene 2 domain of ARIH2 was required for NLRP3 ubiquitination linked through K48 and K63. Deletion of endogenous ARIH2 using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing inhibited NLRP3 ubiquitination and promoted NLRP3 inflammasome activation, resulting in apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain oligomerization, pro-IL-1b processing, and IL-1b production. Conversely, ARIH2 overexpression promoted NLRP3 ubiquitination and inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Here we show that the compound CY-09 specifically blocks NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CY-09 directly binds to the ATP-binding motif of NLRP3 NACHT domain and inhibits NLRP3 ATPase activity, resulting in the suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation. Importantly, treatment with CY-09 shows remarkable therapeutic effects on mouse models of cryopyrin-associated autoinflammatory syndrome (CAPS) and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, CY-09 is active ex vivo for monocytes from healthy individuals or synovial fluid cells from patients with gout.

Other thiol-reactive electrophiles have also been shown to induce the heat shock response as well as to covalently adduct members of the heat shock protein family, such as heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72). To identify sites of modification of Hsp72 by parthenolide, we used high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry to detect 10 lysine, histidine, and cysteine residues of recombinant Hsp72 as modified in vitro by 10 and 100 μM parthenolide. To further ascertain that modification of Hsp72 by parthenolide occurs inside cells and not simply as an in vitro artifact, an alkyne-labeled derivative of parthenolide was synthesized to enable enrichment and detection of protein targets of parthenolide using copper-catalyzed [3 + 2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The alkyne-labeled parthenolide derivative displays an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in undifferentiated acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1) of 13.1 ± 1.1 μM, whereas parthenolide has an IC50 of 4.7 ± 1.1 μM. Concentration dependence of protein modification by the alkyne-parthenolide derivative was demonstrated, as well as in vitro adduction of Hsp72. Following treatment of THP-1 cells in culture by the alkyne-parthenolide, adducted proteins were isolated with neutravidin resin and detected by immunoblotting in the enriched protein fraction.

NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the mechanism of diverse diseases. However, no studies have demonstrated the role of NLRP3 inflammasome and the effects of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors in a mouse model of SCI. We investigated whether inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by the pharmacologic inhibitor BAY 11-7082 or A438079 could exert neuroprotective effects in a mouse model of SCI. Methods: SCI was performed using an aneurysm clip with a closing force of 30 g at the level of the T6-T7 vertebra for 1 min. Motor recovery was evaluated by an open-field test. Neuronal death was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and Nissl staining. Mitochondrial dysfunction was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), western blot, and detection of mitochondrial membrane potential level. Microglia/macrophage activation and astrocytic response were evaluated by immunofluorescence labeling. Results: Inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation by pharmacologic inhibitor BAY 11-7082 or A438079 reduced neuronal death, attenuated spinal cord anatomic damage, and promoted motor recovery. Furthermore, BAY 11-7082 or A438079 directly attenuated the levels of NLRP3 inflammasome and proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, BAY 11-7082 or A438079 alleviated microglia/macrophage activation, neutrophils infiltration, and reactive gliosis, as well as mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions: Collectively, our results demonstrate that pharmacologic suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation controls neuroinflammation, attenuates mitochondrial dysfunction, alleviates the severity of spinal cord damage, and improves neurological recovery after SCI. These data strongly indicate that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a vital contributor to the secondary damage of SCI in mice.",A438079 | BAY 11-7082 | Inflammation | NLRP3 inflammasome | Spinal cord injury,47,1,ZJTCM,81702163,Zhejiang Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration,citing papers,0,2017-10

The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is an ATP-gated nonselective cation channel that induces inflammatory responses in cells and tissues, including salivary gland epithelium. In immune cells, P2X7R activation induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-18, by inducing the oligomerization of the multiprotein complex NLRP3-type inflammasome. Here, our results show that in primary mouse submandibular gland (SMG) epithelial cells, P2X7R activation also induces the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the maturation and release of IL-1, a response that is absent in SMG cells isolated from mice deficient in P2X7Rs (P2X7R/). P2X7R-mediated IL-1 release in SMG epithelial cells is dependent on transmembrane Na and/or K flux and the activation of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a protein required for the activation and stabilization of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Also, using the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers N-acetyl cysteine and Mito-TEMPO, we determined that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are required for P2X7R-mediated IL-1 release. Lastly, in vivo administration of the P2X7R antagonist A438079 in the CD28/, IFN/, NOD.H-2h4 mouse model of salivary gland exocrinopathy ameliorated salivary gland inflammation and enhanced carbachol-induced saliva secretion.

Ricin is considered a potential biological threat agent due to its high availability and ease of production. The clinical manifestation of pulmonary ricin intoxication in animal models is closely related to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which involves pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine upregulation, massive neutrophil infiltration and severe edema. Currently, the only post-exposure measure that is effective against pulmonary ricinosis at clinically relevant time-points following intoxication in pre-clinical studies is passive immunization with anti-ricin neutralizing antibodies. The efficacy of this antitoxin treatment depends on antibody affinity and the time of treatment initiation within a limited therapeutic time window. Small-molecule compounds that interfere directly with the toxin or inhibit its intracellular trafficking may also be beneficial against ricinosis. Another approach relies on the co-administration of antitoxin antibodies with immunomodulatory drugs, thereby neutralizing the toxin while attenuating lung injury. Immunomodulators and other pharmacological-based treatment options should be tailored according to the particular pathogenesis pathways of pulmonary ricinosis.

The expression of NRLP3 is abnormally elevated in numerous human inflammatory diseases, including pulmonary diseases. An injection of carrageenan (CAR) into the pleural cavity triggered an acute inflammatory response, leading to tissue damage, inflammatory exudates, leukocyte infiltration, and increased myeloperoxidase activity. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the inflammasome blocking agents BAY 11-7082 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and Brilliant Blue G (BBG) (45.5 mg/kg, i.p.) in a mouse model of CAR-induced pleurisy. Treatment with BAY 11-7082 or BBG 1 h after CAR injection attenuated pulmonary membrane thickening and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, reduced NF-kB translocation in the nucleus, and inhibited the assembly of the NRLP3/ASC/caspase-1 complex. Treatment with BAY 11-7082 or BBG also down-regulated iNOS, nitrotyrosine, and poly-ADP-ribosyl polymerase expression and inhibited CAR-induced apoptosis.

Most frail, elderly patients are not candidates for curative allogeneic BM transplantations and instead receive expectant management, supportive blood transfusions, or empirical, nontargeted therapy. It has been known for some time that MDS arises in an abnormal BM immune environment; however, connections have only recently been established with recurring MDS-associated mutations. Understanding how mutant clones alter and thrive in the immune environment of marrow failure at the expense of normal hematopoiesis opens the door to novel therapeutic strategies that are aimed at restoring immune and hematopoietic balance. Several examples are highlighted in this review. Haploinsufficiency of microRNAs 145 and 146a in MDS with chromosome 5q deletions leads to derepression of TLR4 signaling, dysplasia, and suppression of normal hematopoiesis. Moreover, mutations of TET2 or DNMT3A—regulators of cytosine meth-ylation—are among the earliest in myeloid cancers and are even found in healthy adults with cryptic clonal hematopoiesis. In innate immune cells, TET2 and DNMT3A mutations impair the resolution of inflammation and production of type I IFNs, respectively. Finally, a common result of MDS-associated mutations is the inappropriate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, with resultant pyroptotic cell death, which favors mutant clone expansion. In summary, MDS-associated mutations alter the BM immune environment, which provides a milieu that is conducive to clonal expansion and leukemic progression. Restoring this balance may offer new therapeutic avenues for patients with MDS.",Cancer | Inflammation | Leukemogenesis | Myeloid cells,9,1,OICR,undefined,Ontario Institute for Cancer Research,citing papers,0,2017-08

Methods: The levels of CD14+ CD16+ and Pit-1 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were measured by flow cytometry. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and 25(OH)D3 were detected by immunoturbidimetry while IL-6 and MCP-1 were assayed with enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA). The amounts of vitamin D receptors (VDRs) and Pit-1 mRNA in human acute monocytic leukemia cell lines (THP-1) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), while western blot was utilized for measurement of NF-κB p65 and p-STAT5. Results: Compared to the healthy group, DNU patients showed markedly higher CD14+CD16+, Pit-1, CRP, IL-6 and MCP-1, while 25(OH) D3 was reduced. Following stimulation with PFA or PTN, comparison with DNU group revealed that THP-1 monocytes showed a significant down-regulation of Pit-1 (1.34 ± 0.06 for PFA; 1.60 ± 0.25 for PTN; p < 0.05); NF-κB p65 (2.65 ± 0.25 for PFA; 3.88 ± 0.13 for PTN; p < 0.01), p-STAT5 (2.49 ± 0.10 for PFA; 3.03 ± 0.09 for PTN; p < 0.01) and a significant decrease in levels of IL-6 (55.38 ± 3.22 for PFA, 68.68 ± 6.01 for PTN; p < 0.05); MCP-1(39.67 ± 3.62 for PFA; 52.62 ± 5.00 for PTN; p < 0.01), except for VDR (0.64 ± 0.15 for PFA, 0.43 ± 0.03 for PTN; p < 0.05). Conclusion: The level of expression of Pit-1 has a positive correlation with the level of inflammatory monocytes, which indicates that Pit-1 can be used as a new biomarker for DNU diagnosis. In addition, since Pit-1 is connected to NF-κB and STAT5 signaling pathways which are critical to inflammatory immune response, development of drugs that target Pit-1 could be an approach in developing new strategies for DNU therapy.",Diabetic nephropathy | Inflammation | Monocytes | NF-κB | Pit-1 | STAT5 | Uremia,0,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2017-07

Here, we elucidate the modulation of PARs, TLRs, NODs, and the role of MAPK and NF-κB in IL-1β and CXCL8 release. THP1 cells were stimulated with P. gingivalis wild-type W50 and its isogenic gingipain mutants: Rgp mutant E8 and Kgp mutant K1A. We observed modulation of PARs, TLRs, NOD, IL-1β and CXCL8 expression by P. gingivalis. Gingipains hydrolyse IL-1β and CXCL8, which is more evident for IL-1β accumulation at 24 h. Inhibition of PKC (protein kinase C), p38 and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinases) partially reduced P. gingivalis-induced IL-1β at 6 h, whereas PKC and ERK reduced CXCL8 at both 6 and 24 h. Following NF-κB inhibition, P. gingivalis-induced IL-1β and CXCL8 were completely suppressed to basal levels. Overall, TLRs, PARs and NOD possibly act in synergy with PKC, MAPK ERK/p38 and NF-κB in P. gingivalis-induced IL-1β and CXCL8 release from THP1 cells.

In this study, we found that E. coli O157:H7 infection induced NLRP3 assembly, caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 release in Caco-2 cells. Infection also resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction with disrupted mitochondrial potential and mitochondrial complex-I activity, as well as the cytosolic release of cytochrome c and altered mitochondrial respiratory chain. The damage of mitochondria led to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytosolic release of mitochondrial DNA. Moreover, ROS was required for E. coli O157:H7 induced NLRP3 assembly as inhibiting mitochondrial ROS release by ROS scavengers Mito-TEMPO and N-acetylcysteine abrogated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in Caco-2 cells in response to E. coli O157:H7.

In adaptive immunity, T cells and B cells induce immune responses through their respective antigen receptors, called T-cell receptors and B-cell receptors, both of which specifically recognize antigens or antigenic peptides derived from microbial pathogens. In innate immunity, germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) serve as sensors that detect the pathogen-associated molecular patterns found in microbial pathogens. PRRs have been classified into different families: the toll-like receptor family, nucleotide binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor family, retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptor family, and C-type lectin receptor family. Upon the recognition of microbial pathogens, antigen receptors or PRRs initiate various signaling pathways, leading to the activation of different transcriptional programs that provoke immune responses in order to eliminate invaded pathogens.

However, it is poorly understood that how various molecules interact within HSCs during the progression of NASH to fibrosis. The aim of the present study is to delineate how inflammasome molecules, hedgehog signaling and autophagy provoke HSC activation using palmitic acid (PA) as a major insult. Main methods Inflammasome activation, hedgehog signaling activity and autophagy in PA-exposed HSCs were determined to investigate their role in activation of human and rodent HSC lines or primary HSCs. Key findings PA treatment elicited HSC activation reflected by increased mRNA levels of transforming growth factor-β1, connective tissue growth factor, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and procollagen type I (α1). In addition, expression levels of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) and hedgehog signaling transcription factor Gli-1 were increased in PA-exposed HSCs. It's evident that PA treatment resulted in increased production of light chain 3-II and autophagosomes, as well as enhanced autophagy flux reflected by transduction of an adeno-associated viral vector. Whereas, reduced autophagy, which is often seen in the late stage of NASH, provoked inflammasome activation. Moreover, suppressing the Hh signaling pathway by LDE225 blocked production of light chain 3-II and autophagy flux. Significance Saturated fatty acids, such as PA, stimulate HSC activation through inflammasomes and hedgehog signaling. Meanwhile, compromised autophagy may facilitate HSC activation, implicating valuable candidates for pharmacologic intervention against the progression of fibrogenesis in NASH.","Autophagy, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis | Hedgehog signaling | Hepatic stellate cells | NLRP3",21,0,NSFC,16140903700,National Natural Science Foundation of China,citing papers,0,2017-05

Various structurally diverse stimulators activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through different signaling pathways. We previously reported that ugonin U (UgU), a natural flavonoid isolated from Helminthostachys zeylanica (L) Hook, directly stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) and triggers superoxide release in human neutrophils. In the present study, we showed that UgU induced NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1β processing in lipopolysaccharide-primed human monocytes. Moreover, UgU elicited mitochondrial superoxide generation in a dose-dependent manner, and a specific scavenger of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) diminished UgU-induced IL-1β and caspase-1 activation. UgU induced Ca2+ mobilization, which was inhibited by treatment with inhibitors of PLC or inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R). Blocking Ca2+ mobilization, PLC, or IP3R diminished UgU-induced IL-1β release, caspase-1 activation, and mitochondrial ROS generation. These data demonstrated that UgU activated the NLPR3 inflammasome activation through Ca2+ mobilization and the production of mitochondrial ROS. We also demonstrated that UgU-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation enhanced the bactericidal function of human monocytes. The ability of UgU to stimulate human neutrophils and monocytes, both of which are professional phagocytes, and its capacity to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is a promising molecular target for developing anti-infective medicine, indicate that UgU treatment should be considered as a possible novel therapy for treating infectious diseases.",Inflammasome | Innate immunity | Monocyte | NLRP3 | Ugonin U,15,1,NSC,102-2628-B-255-003-MY3,National Science Council,citing papers,0,2017-04

Our previous study found that the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated stress-induced depression-like behavior in mice via regulating neuroinflammation. However, it still remains unclear that how the NLRP3 inflammasome influences related inflammatory signaling pathway to contribute to neuroinflammation in depression. Methods We used wild-type mice and NLRP3 gene knockout mice to explore the role of NLRP3 inflammasome and related inflammatory signaling pathways in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced depression mouse model. Results Both wild-type and NLRP3 knockout stress group mice gained less weight than control group mice after 4 weeks CUMS exposure. The wild-type mice subjected to 4 weeks CUMS displayed depression-like behaviors, including decreased sucrose preference and increased immobility time in the tail suspension test. The NLRP3 knockout stress group mice didn't demonstrate depression-like behaviors. The levels of interleukin-1β protein in serum and hippocampi of CUMS exposed wild-type mice were significantly higher, while the NLRP3 knockout stress group mice didn't show an elevation of interleukin-1β levels. Similarly to early researches, we found that CUMS led to promoted NLRP3 expression in hippocampi. In addition, the hippocampi in CUMS exposed wild-type mice had higher p-JNK and p-p38 protein expression, which indicated activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. The knockout of NLRP3 gene inhibited CUMS-induced activation of the MAPK pathway. The nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) protein complex was activated in the hippocampi of wild-type mice after CUMS exposure, while knockout of NLRP3 gene hindered its activation. Conclusions These data further proved that the NLRP3 inflammasome mediated CUMS-induced depression-like behavior. The NLRP3 inflammasome regulated CUMS-induced MAPK pathway and NF-κB protein complex activation in depression mouse model. Further researches targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome-signaling pathway might be under a promising future in the prevention and treatment of depression.",Depression | Inflammation | Interleukin-1β | Knockout | NLRP3 inflammasome | Stress,88,0,NSFC,2013YQ190467,National Natural Science Foundation of China,citing papers,0,2017-03

NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome has been implicated in HIV-induced microglial activation, but the mechanism(s) remain unclear. Because HIV-1 Transactivator of Transcription (Tat) protein continues to be present despite antiretroviral therapy and activates NF-kB, we hypothesized that Tat could prime the NLRP3 inflammasome. We found a dose- and time-dependent induction of NLRP3 expression in microglia exposed to Tat compared with control. Tat exposure also time-dependently increased the mature caspase-1 and IL-1β levels and enhanced the IL-1β secretion. These in vitro findings were validated in archival brain tissues from Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)-infected and uninfected rhesus macaques. Further validation of NLRP3 priming in vivo involved administration of lipopolysac-charide (LPS) to HIV transgenic (Tg) rats followed by assessment of IL-1β mRNA expression and inflammasome activation (ASC oligomers and mature IL-1β). Intriguingly, LPS potentiated upregulation of IL-1β mRNA and inflammasome activation in HIV-Tg rats compared with the wild-type controls. Interestingly, we found an inverse relationship in the expression of NLRP3 and its negative regulator, miR-223, suggesting a miR-223-mediated mechanism for Tat-induced NLRP3 priming. Furthermore, blockade of NLRP3 resulted in decreased IL-1β secretion. Collectively, these findings suggest a novel role of Tat in priming and activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, NLRP3 can be envisioned as a therapeutic target for ameliorating Tat-mediated neuroinflammation.",HIV-1 Tat | Inflammasome | Microglia | Neuroinflammation | NLRP3,76,1,NIH,R01DA033150,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2017-03

In this study we have isolated Mangiferin from the tubers of Pueraria tuberosa (PT-Mangiferin) and analysed the mechanism of its potent anti-inflammatory effects in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line and in a carrageenan induced air pouch model. PT-Mangiferin was non-toxic to primary cells but showed significant toxicity and apoptotic effect on cancerous cells. It significantly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory mediators (COX-2, iNOS and TNF-α) in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Further, it has also reduced the generation of ROS and inhibited LPS induced NF-kB translocation in these cells. Additionally, PT-Mangiferin significantly reduced inflammation in a mouse air pouch model by inhibiting the infiltration of monocytes and neutrophils and reducing the production of cytokines. These effects were mediated via inactivation of NLRP3 inflammasome complex and its downstream signalling molecules. Taken together these results suggest that PT-Mangiferin is potent anti-inflammatory compound that reduces inflammation and holds promise in development of herbal based anti-inflammatory therapeutics in future.",,31,1,ICMR,undefined,Indian Council of Medical Research,citing papers,0,2017-02

Many studies suggested that local inflammation, rather than mechanical compression, results in radiculopathy induced by LDH. On the molecular and cellular level, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome have been implicated in the regulation of neuroinflammation formation and progression. In this study, the autologous nucleus pulposus (NP) was implanted in the left L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) to mimic LDH in rats. We investigated the expression of NF-κB and the components of NLRP3 inflammasome in the DRG neurons in rats.

Type 1 diabetic rat model was established by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). MI/R was induced by ligating the left anterior descending artery (LAD) for 30 minutes followed by 2 h reperfusion. H9C2 cardiomyocytes were exposed to high glucose (HG, 30 mM) conditions and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) stimulation. The myocardial infarct size, CK-MB, and LDH release in the diabetic rats subjected to MI/R were significantly higher than those in the nondiabetic rats, accompanied with increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation and increased pyroptosis. Inhibition of inflammasome activation with BAY11-7082 significantly decreased the MI/R injury. In vitro studies showed similar effects, as BAY11-7082 or the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine, attenuated HG and H/R-induced H9C2 cell injury. In conclusion, hyperglycaemia-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation may be a ROS-dependent process in pyroptotic cell death, and NLRP3 inflammasome-induced pyroptosis aggravates MI/R injury in diabetic rats.",,138,1,,81300674,National Natural Science Foundation of China,citing papers,0,2017-01

NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 7 (NALP7) is one inflammasome constituent, but little is known about its cellular handling. Here we show a mechanism for NALP7 protein stabilization and activation of the inflammasome by Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonism with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the synthetic acylated lipopeptide Pam3CSK4. NALP7 is constitutively ubiquitinated and recruited to the endolysosome for degradation. With TLR ligation, the deubiquitinase enzyme, STAM-binding protein (STAMBP) impedes NALP7 trafficking to lysosomes to increase NALP7 abundance. STAMBP deubiquitinates NALP7 and STAMBP knockdown abrogates LPS or Pam3CSK4-induced increases in NALP7 protein. A small-molecule inhibitor of STAMBP deubiquitinase activity, BC-1471, decreases NALP7 protein levels and suppresses IL-1b release after TLR agonism. These findings describe a unique pathway of inflammasome regulation with the identification of STAMBP as a potential therapeutic target to reduce pro-inflammatory stress.",,23,1,NIH,P01HL114453,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2017-01

Our previous study indicated that total saponins of Panax japonicus (SPJ) rhizoma and Chikusetsu saponin V, one main component of SPJ, could exert the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study aimed to investigate the in vivo and Ex vivo anti-inflammatory activities of another main component of SPJ, namely Chikusetsu saponin IVa (CS). CS could significantly inhibited HFD-induced lipid homeostasis, and inhibited inflammation in adipose tissue, as reflected by the decreased mRNA expression levels of inflammationrelated genes and secretion of the chemokines/cytokines, inhibited the accumulation of adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) and shifted their polarization from M1 to M2, suppressed HFD-induced expression of NLRP3 inflammasome component genes and decreased IL-1β and Caspase-1 production in mice. Moreover, CS treatment also inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Meanwhile, CS treatment inhibited an NLRP3-induced ASC pyroptosome formation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pyroptosis. Furthermore, CS treatment suppressed HFD-induced NF-κB signaling in vivo and LPS-induced NF-κB activation as reflected by the fact that their phosphorylated forms and the ratios of pNF-κB/NF-κB, pIKK/IKK, and pIκB/IκB were all decreased in EAT from HFD-fed mice treated with CS as compared with those of HFD mice.

In this report, we investigated the underlining mechanisms by which DRibbles induced T-cell activation, particularly how DRibbles activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We found that DRibbles could induce a rapid differentiation of monocytes and DC precursor (pre-DC) cells into functional APCs. DRibbles triggered innate receptor signaling via Toll-like Receptors (TLR)-2, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2), but not TLR3, TLR5, or TLR9. DRibbles induced PBMCs to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IL-1β. DRibbles induced IL-1β release from PBMC or THP-1 cells without LPS priming, but required the core machinery of NLRP3 inflammasomes. Active endocytosis was required for inflammasome activation and cross presentation, and blocking endosome acidification or the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway resulted in opposite effects on these two processes. Our data show that DRibbles could induce strong innate immune responses via multiple pattern recognition receptors, and explain why DRibbles could function as excellent antigen carriers to induce adaptive immune responses to both tumor cells and viruses. In contrast to the well-established inhibitory effect of autophagy on the inflammasome activation of APCs, our study demonstrates that isolated autophagosomes (DRibbles) from antigen donor cells activate inflammasomes by providing first and second signals required for IL-1β production by PMBC.",,24,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2016-08

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin on NLRP3 inflammasome in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells and explore its underlying mechanism. Methods: Human monocytic THP-1 cells were pretreated with atorvastatin for 1 h and then induced by PMA for 48 h. Total protein was collected for real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Cytokine IL-1β release was detected by ELISA assay. And the NF-κB p65 translocation was detected by cellular NF-κB translocation kit. Results: It was shown that atorvastatin significantly reduced the expression of NLRP3, the cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β in PMA-induced THP-1 cells. Moreover, Bay (a NF-κB inhibitor) treatment greatly suppressed the expression of NLRP3, the cleavage of caspase-1 and IL-1β in PMA-induced THP-1 cells, suggesting that the activation of NF-κB pathway takes part in regulating the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome. In addition, atorvastatin markedly inhibited the up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and the activation of nuclear factor kappa b (NF-κB) in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells.

Based on its reported antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties, we investigated whether shikonin suppresses the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Inflammasomes are cytosolic protein complexes that serve as scaffolds for recruitment and activation of caspase-1, which, in turn, results in cleavage and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. NLRP3 inflammasome activation involves two steps: priming, i.e. the activation of NF-êB pathway, and inflammasome assembly. While shikonin has previously been reported to suppress the priming step, we demonstrated that shikonin also inhibits the second step of inflammasome activation induced by soluble and particulate NLRP3 instigators in primed immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Shikonin decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in response to nigericin more potently than acetylshikonin. Our results showed that shikonin also inhibits AIM2 inflammasome activation by double stranded DNA. Shikonin inhibited ASC speck formation and caspase-1 activation in murine macrophages and suppressed the activity of isolated caspase-1, demonstrating that it directly targets caspase-1. Complexing shikonin with β-lactoglobulin reduced its toxicity while preserving the inhibitory effect on NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting that shikonin with improved bioavailability might be interesting for therapeutic applications in inflammasome-mediated conditions.",,19,1,ARRS,J3-5503,Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS,citing papers,0,2016-07

Excess urinary oxalate, whether from primary or enteric hyperoxaluria, can lead to oxalate deposition in the kidney. Oxalate crystals are associated with renal inflammation, fibrosis, and progressive renal failure. It has long been known that as the glomerular filtration rate becomes reduced in chronic kidney disease (CKD), there is striking elevation of plasma oxalate. Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that elevation of plasma oxalate in CKD may promote renal inflammation and more rapid progression of CKD independent of primary cause. Recent findings The inflammasome has recently been identified to play a critical role in oxalate-induced renal inflammation. Oxalate crystals have been shown to activate the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome (also known as NALP3, NLRP3, or cryopyrin), resulting in release of IL-1β and macrophage infiltration. Deletion of inflammasome proteins in mice protects from oxalate-induced renal inflammation and progressive renal failure. Summary The findings reviewed in this article expand our understanding of the relevance of elevated plasma oxalate levels leading to inflammasome activation. We propose that inhibiting oxalate-induced inflammasome activation, or lowering plasma oxalate, may prevent or mitigate progressive renal damage in CKD, and warrants clinical trials.",chronic kidney disease | inflammasome | innate immune system | oxalate,40,0,NIH,P30DK079310,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2016-07

IL-1β is synthesized as immature pro-IL-1β, which is cleaved by activated caspase-1. Caspase-1 is, in turn, activated by a multi-protein complex known as an inflammasome. In this study, we investigated the inflammatory response of a prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) to T. vaginalis and, specifically, the capacity of T. vaginalis to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. METHODS: RWPE-1 cells were stimulated by live T. vaginalis, and subsequent expression of pro-IL-1β, IL-1β, NLRP3, ASC and caspase-1 was determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting. IL-1β and caspase-1 production was also measured by ELISA. To evaluate the effects of NLRP3 and caspase-1 on IL-1β production, the activated RWPE-1 cells were transfected with small interfering RNAs to silence the NLRP3 and caspase-1 genes. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was observed by fluorescence microscopy. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by spectrofluorometry. RESULTS: When RWPE-1 cells were stimulated with live T. vaginalis, the mRNA and protein expression of IL-1β, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 increased. Moreover, silencing of NLRP3 and caspase-1 attenuated T. vaginalis-induced IL-1β secretion. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI and high extracellular potassium ion suppressed the production of IL-1β, caspase-1, and the expression of NLRP3 and ASC proteins. The specific NF-κB inhibitor, Bay 11–7082, inhibited IL-1β production, and also inhibited the production of caspase-1, ASC and NLRP3 proteins. CONCLUSIONS: T. vaginalis induces the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human prostate epithelial cells via ROS and potassium ion efflux, and this results in IL-1β production. This is the first evidence for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the inflammatory response by prostate epithelial cells infected with T. vaginalis.

While genetic factors and neuroinflammation contribute significantly to AD pathogenesis, whether increased cholesterol level is a causative factor or a result of AD is equivocal. Prenylation of proteins regulating neuronal functions requires mevalonate-derived farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). The observation that the levels of FPP and GGPP, but not that of cholesterol, are elevated in AD patients is consistent with the finding that statins, competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, reduce FPP and GGPP levels and amyloid β protein production in preclinical studies. Retrospective studies show inverse correlations between incidence of AD and the intake and serum levels of the HMG CoA reductase-suppressive tocotrienols; tocopherols show mixed results. Tocotrienols, but not tocopherols, block the processing and nuclear localization of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, the transcriptional factor for HMG CoA reductase and FPP synthase, and enhance the degradation of HMG CoA reductase. Consequently, tocotrienols deplete the pool of FPP and GGPP and potentially blunt prenylation-dependent AD pathogenesis. The antiinflammatory activity of tocotrienols further contributes to their protection against AD. The mevalonate- and inflammation-suppressive activities of tocotrienols may represent those of an estimated 23,000 mevalonate-derived plant secondary metabolites called isoprenoids, many of which are neuroprotective.

Parthenin, like artemisinin, has an effect on Plasmodium blood stage development. We extended the evaluation of parthenin as a potential therapeutic for the transmissible stages of Plasmodium falciparum as it transitions between human and mosquito, with the aim of gaining potential mechanistic insight into the inhibitory activity of this compound. We posited that if parthenin targets different biological pathways in the parasite, this in turn could pave the way for the development of druggable compounds that could prevent the spread of artemisininresistant parasites. We examined parthenin's effect on male gamete activation and the ookinete-to-oocyst transition in the mosquito as well as on stage V gametocytes that are present in peripheral blood. Parthenin arrested parasite development for each of the stages tested. The broad inhibitory properties of parthenin on the evaluated parasite stages may suggest different mechanisms of action between parthenin and artemisinin. Parthenin's cytotoxicity notwithstanding, its demonstrated activity in this study suggests that structurally related SQLs with a better safety profile deserve further exploration. We used our battery of assays to test parthenolide, which has a more compelling safety profile. Parthenolide demonstrated activity nearly identical to that of parthenin against P. falciparum, highlighting its potential as a possible transmission-blocking drug scaffold.

We demonstrated that (i) pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin; PKC-α inhibitor, Go6976; p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and NF-κB inhibitor, Bay11-7082 inhibited the expression and activation of proMMP-2 induced by ET-1; (ii) ET-1 treatment to the cells stimulated NADPH oxidase and PKCα activity, p38MAPK phosphorylation as well as NF-κB activation by translocation of NF-κBp65 subunit from cytosol to the nucleus, and subsequently by increasing its DNA-binding activity; (iii) ET-1 increases MT1-MMP expression, which was inhibited upon pretreatment with apocynin, Go6976, SB293580, and Bay 11-7082; (iv) ET-1 treatment to the cells downregulated TIMP-2 level. Although apocynin and Go6976 pretreatment reversed ET-1 effect on TIMP-2 level, yet pretreatment of the cells with SB203580 and Bay 11-7082 did not show any discernible change in TIMP-2 level by ET-1.

The use of the YSK12-MEND resulted in a gene silencing efficiency in excess of 90%, with a median effective dose (ED50) of 1.5 nM, whereas the maximum gene silencing efficiency of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX was less than 60% and the ED50 was 25 nM. Furthermore, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1, an immune suppressive molecule in DCs, silenced in the mouse DC by the YSK12-MEND showed a drastic enhancement in cytokine production, resulting in the significant suppression of tumor growth when it was applied to DC-based therapy against a mouse lymphoma.

Inappropriate activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the progression of many noncommunicable diseases such as gout, type II diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Inhibiting the inflammasome may significantly reduce damaging inflammation and is therefore regarded as a therapeutic target. Currently approved inhibitors of interleukin-1β are rilonacept, canakinumab, and anakinra.

The Tat pathway contributes to the virulence of numerous bacterial pathogens that cause disease in humans, cattle and poultry. Thus, the Tat pathway has the potential to be a novel therapeutic target. Deciphering the Tat protein transport mechanism has been challenging since the active translocon only assembles transiently in the presence of substrate and a proton motive force. To identify inhibitors of Tat transport that could be used as biochemical tools and possibly as drug development leads, we developed a high throughput screen (HTS) to assay the effects of compounds in chemical libraries against protein export by the Escherichia coli Tat pathway. The primary screen is a live cell assay based on a fluorescent Tat substrate that becomes degraded in the cytoplasm when Tat transport is inhibited. Consequently, low fluorescence in the presence of a putative Tat inhibitor was scored as a hit. Two diverse chemical libraries were screened, yielding average Z′-factors of 0.74 and 0.44, and hit rates of ∼0.5% and 0.04%, respectively. Hits were evaluated by a series of secondary screens. Electric field gradient (Δψ) measurements were particularly important since the bacterial Tat transport requires a Δψ. Seven low IC50 hits were eliminated by Δψ assays, suggesting ionophore activity. As Δψ collapse is generally toxic to animal cells and efficient membrane permeability is generally favored during the selection of library compounds, these results suggest that secondary screening of hits against electrochemical effects should be done early during hit validation. Though none of the short-listed compounds inhibited Tat transport directly, the screening and follow-up assays developed provide a roadmap to pursue Tat transport inhibitors.",,8,1,NIH,U54HG005032,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2016-02

Chronic glucocorticoids (GCs) exposure has deleterious effects on the structure and function of neurons and is associated with development and progression of AD. However, little is known about the proinflammatory effects of chronic GCs exposure on neurodegeneration in brain. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic dexamethasone (DEX) treatment (5. mg/kg, s.c. for 7, 14, 21 and 28. days) on behavior, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammatory parameters of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain-containing 1 (NLRP-1) inflammasome in male mice. The results showed that DEX treatment for 21 and 28. days significantly reduced the spontaneous motor activity and exploratory behavior of the mice. In addition, these mice showed significant neurodegeneration and a decrease of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus CA3. DEX treatment for 7, 14, 21 and 28. days significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Moreover, DEX treatment for 21 and 28. days significantly increased the proteins expression of NLRP-1, Caspase-1, Caspase-5, apoptosis associated speck-like protein (ASC), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), p-NF-κB, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-18 and IL-6 in the frontal cortex and hippocampus brain tissue.

The cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, are implicated in both acute and chronic neuroinflammatory disorders. The cells of macrophage lineage represent the powerhouse of inflammasome activation in the CNS, although other cells including astrocytes and neurons exhibit inflammasome activation in stimulus and species restricted manner. The outcomes of inflammasome activation in the CNS are wide ranging encompassing both protective and pathogenic consequences depending on the individual PAMP/DAMP, inflammasome, cell type and species. The activation of inflammasomes is a complex sequence of events that lends itself to opportunities for modulation at multiple steps and demands further exploration. However, with the current understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of inflammasome inhibitors, it is feasible to target inflammasome activation at an early stage to delay neurological disease onset and progression. A major concern remains as to whether targeting at the level of inflammasome or blocking the cytokines will be beneficial for control of neuropathogenesis. Given an early prediction of disease, targeting upstream at the level of inflammasome induction would optimize outcomes by not only limiting levels of cytokine release into the brain microenvironment, but also by reducing cell death due to pyroptosis. As new therapies are developed targeting the sensor, adaptor and effector components of inflammasomes, the prospect of regulating inflammasome activation at multiple stages may become a clinical reality, permitting improved outcomes for inflammasome-driven neurological diseases.",Cytokines | Inflammasome | Interleukin-1 | Neuroinflammation | Pyroptosis,0,0,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2016-01

The accumulation of Alu RNA, resulting from DICER1 deficiency, is shown capable of triggering the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and causing caspase-8-activated apoptosis in an IL-18/MyD88-dependent manner, which provides a new source of evidence for the interplay between cell death and inflammasome.

This response is tightly regulated since any aberrant activation of immune responses would have severe pathological consequences such as sepsis or chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

Here we tested the hypothesis that either a selective pharmacological inhibition or a genetic downregulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome results in reduction of the diet-induced metabolic alterations. Male C57/BL6 wild-type mice and NLRP3-/- littermates were fed control diet or high-fat, high-fructose diet (HD). A subgroup of HD-fed wild-type mice was treated with the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (3 mg/kg intraperitoneally [IP]). HD feeding increased plasma and hepatic lipids and impaired glucose homeostasis and renal function. Renal and hepatic injury was associated with robust increases in profibrogenic markers, while only minimal fibrosis was recorded. None of these metabolic abnormalities were detected in HD-fed NLRP3-/- mice, and they were dramatically reduced in HD-mice treated with the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor. BAY 11-7082 also attenuated the diet-induced increase in NLRP3 inflammasome expression, resulting in inhibition of caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 production (in liver and kidney). Interestingly, BAY 11-7082, but not gene silencing, inhibited nuclear factor (NF)-κB nuclear translocation. Overall, these results demonstrate that the selective pharmacological modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome attenuates the metabolic abnormalities and the related organ injury/dysfunction caused by chronic exposure to HD, with effects similar to those obtained by NLRP3 gene silencing.",,32,1,UNITO,undefined,Università degli Studi di Torino,citing papers,0,2015-11

Crosstalk between Toll-like receptor-4 signaling and the neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein, major histocompatibility class 2 transcription activator, incompatibility locus protein from Podospora anserina, and telomerase-associated protein (NACHT), leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome against pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns can cause exaggerated inflammation. We previously established that the Toll-like receptor-4- interacting SPA4 peptide suppresses gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Toll-like receptor-4 ligand)- induced nuclear factor-κB and inflammatory response. In the present study, we hypothesized that the SPA4 peptide exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the crosstalk between Toll-like receptor-4 signaling and the NLRP3 inflammasome. We evaluated binding of the lipopolysaccharide-ligand to cell-surface Toll-like receptor-4 in the presence or absence of adenosine triphosphate (an NLRP3 inflammasome inducer) by flow cytometry. The expression and activity of NLRP3 inflammasome-related parameters were studied in cells challenged with lipopolysaccharide and adenosine triphosphate using molecular and immunologic methods. The cells were challenged with lipopolysaccharide and treated with SPA4 peptide before (pre-adenosine triphosphate) or after (post-adenosine triphosphate) secondary challenge with adenosine triphosphate. Our data demonstrate that the Toll-like receptor-4-interacting SPA4 peptide does not affect the binding of lipopolysaccharide to Toll-like receptor-4 in the presence or absence of adenosine triphosphate. We also found that the SPA4 peptide inhibits mRNA and cellular protein levels of pro-interleukin-1β and NLRP3, formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase activity, and release of interleukin-1β. Furthermore, the SPA4 peptide treatment reduced the secreted levels of interleukin-1β from cells overexpressing Toll-like receptor-4 compared with cells expressing the dominant-negative form of Toll-like receptor-4.

Although the presence of amyloid deposits of α-synuclein (α-syn) is the main pathological feature, PD brains also present a severe permanent inflammation, which largely contributes to neuropathology. Although α-syn has recently been implicated in this process, the molecular mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated the ability of different α-syn aggregates to trigger inflammatory responses.We showed that α- syn induced inflammation through activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and the nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome only when folded as amyloid fibrils. Oligomeric species, thought to be the primary species responsible for the disease, were surprisingly unable to trigger the same cascades.As neuroinflammation is a key player in PD pathology, these results put fibrils back to the fore and rekindles discussions about the primary toxic species contributing to the disease. Our data also suggest that the inflammatory properties of α-syn fibrils are linked to their intrinsic structure, most probably to their cross-β structure.

Methods Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, with 10 rats in each group: spontaneous breathing control group, normal tidal volume (VT) group (VT 8 mL/kg) and high VT group (VT 40 mL/kg). All of the rats underwent tracheotomy. Then rats in spontaneous breathing control group were kept to have spontaneous breathing, while rats in normal VT group and high VT group received mechanical ventilation. After 4 hours, the rats were sacrificed by carotid artery bleeding, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), blood serum and lung tissue were collected. Lung wet/dry ratios (W/D) were measured. Light microscopy and electron microscopy were performed to observe the pathological changes in lung tissue, and the ultrastructural changes in alveolar macrophages. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to measure the total protein content in the BALF and the interleukins (IL-1β and IL-18) in the serum and BALF. The mRNA expressions and protein levels of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), caspase-1, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) in alveolar macrophages were assayed by real-time fluorescent quantization reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western Blot.

NLRs encode a central nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) consisting of the NAIP, CIITA, HET-E and TP1 (NACHT) domain and the NACHT associated domain (NAD), which facilitates receptor oligomerization and downstream inflammasome signaling. The NBD contains highly conserved regions, known as Walker motifs, that are required for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. The NLR containing a PYRIN domain (PYD) 7 (NLRP7) has been recently shown to assemble an ASC and caspase-1-containing high molecular weight inflammasome complex in response to microbial acylated lipopeptides and Staphylococcus aureus infection. However, the molecular mechanism responsible for NLRP7 inflammasome activation is still elusive. Here we demonstrate that the NBD of NLRP7 is an ATP binding domain and has ATPase activity. We further show that an intact nucleotide-binding Walker A motif is required for NBD-mediated nucleotide binding and hydrolysis, oligomerization, and NLRP7 inflammasome formation and activity. Accordingly, THP-1 cells expressing a mutated Walker A motif display defective NLRP7 inflammasome activation, interleukin (IL)-1β release and pyroptosis in response to acylated lipopeptides and S. aureus infection.

While cell and tissue damage due to acute hypoxia mostly leads to cell necrosis, in chronic hypoxia, cells that are located closer to vessels are able to survive adapting their phenotype through the expression of a number of genes, including proinflammatory receptors for alarmins. These receptors are activated by alarmins released by necrotic cells and generate signals for master transcription factors such as NFkB, AP1, etc. which control hundreds of genes for innate immunity and damage repair. Clinical consequences of chronic inflammatory reparative response activation include cell and tissue remodeling, damage in the primary site and, the systemic involvement of distant organs and tissues. Thus every time a tissue environment becomes stably hypoxic, inflammation can be activated followed by chronic damage and cell death or repair with vessel proliferation and fibrosis. This pathway can occur in cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke, diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, chronic and autoimmune diseases and age-related diseases.

Parthenolide present in extracts of the herb feverfew has demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect. However, the effect of parthenolide on the Akt/mTOR and NF-κB pathway activation-induced productions of inflammatory mediators in keratinocytes has not been studied. Using human keratinocytes, we investigated the effect of parthenolide on the inflammatory mediator production in relation to the Toll-like receptor-4-mediated-Akt/mTOR and NF-κB pathways, which regulate the transcription genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. Parthenolide, Akt inhibitor, Bay 11-7085, and N-acetylcysteine each attenuated the lipopolysaccharide-induced production of IL-1β and PGE2, increase in the levels of cyclooxygenase, formation of reactive oxygen species, increase in the levels of Toll-like receptor-4, and activation of the Akt/mTOR and NF-κB in keratinocytes. The results show that parthenolide appears to attenuate the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of inflammatory mediators in keratinocytes by suppressing the Toll-like receptor-4-mediated activation of the Akt, mTOR, and NF-κB pathways. The activation of signaling transduction pathways appear to be regulated by reactive oxygen species.

TLRs are a phylogenetically conserved diverse family of sensors that drive innate immune responses following interactions with PAMPs. TLR3 and TLR4 recognize viral dsRNA Poly (I:C) and bacterial endotoxin LPS, respectively. Importantly, these receptors differ in their downstream adaptor molecules. Thus far, only a few studies have investigated the effects of TLR3 and TLR4 in macrophages. However, a genome-wide search for the effects of these TLRs has not been performed in microglia using RNA-seq. Gene expression patterns were determined for the BV-2 microglial cell line when stimulated with viral dsRNA Poly (I:C) or bacterial endotoxin LPS to identify novel transcribed genes, as well as investigate how differences in downstream signaling could influence gene expression in innate immunity. Results: Sequencing assessment and quality evaluation revealed that common and unique patterns of proinflammatory genes were significantly up-regulated in response to TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation. However, the IFN/viral response gene showed a stronger response to TLR3 stimulation than to TLR4 stimulation. Unexpectedly, TLR3 and TLR4 stimulation did not activate IFN-ß and IRF3 in BV-2 microglia. Most importantly, we observed that previously unidentified transcription factors (TFs) (i.e., IRF1, IRF7, and IRF9) and the epigenetic regulators KDM4A and DNMT3L were significantly up-regulated in both TLR3- and TLR4-stimulated microglia. We also identified 29 previously unidentified genes that are important in immune regulation. In addition, we confirmed the expressions of key inflammatory genes as well as pro-inflammatory mediators in the supernatants were significantly induced in TLR3-and TLR4-stimulated primary microglial cells. Moreover, transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and isoforms, as well as differential promoter usage, revealed a complex pattern of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation upon infection with TLR3 and TLR4. Furthermore, TF motif analysis (-950 to +50 bp of the 5' upstream promoters) revealed that the DNA sequences for NF-κB, IRF1, and STAT1 were significantly enriched in TLR3- and TLR4-stimulated microglia. Conclusions: These unprecedented findings not only permit a comparison of TLR3-and TLR4-stimulated genes but also identify new genes that have not been previously implicated in innate immunity.",Gene regulation | Innate immunity | Microglia | RNA sequencing | Toll-like receptor,35,1,MSIP,2011-0030049,"Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning",citing papers,0,2015-07

Pyroptosis is a caspase-1-dependent pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death, mediated by the activation of inflammasomes. To understand the pharmacological basis of the therapeutic effects of FAEs, the anti-pyroptotic activity of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) and its hydrolysis metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) was studied in a model of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis of human macrophages. Phorbol myristate acetate-differentiated THP-1 cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (5 μg/ml; 4 h), then pulsed with ATP (5 mM; 1 h). MMF, DMF, or parthenolide (positive control) were added 1 h before the ATP pulse. The pyroptotic cell death was evaluated by morphological examination and quantified by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase leakage. The ATP-triggered death of THP-1 cells (60.4 ± 4.0%) was significantly (P < 0.01) prevented by DMF, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (pIC<inf>50</inf> and maximal effect were 6.6 and 67.6 ± 1.2%, respectively). MMF was less efficacious than DMF. These effects were accompanied by a decreased intracellular activation of caspase-1 and interleukin-1β release from ATP-treated cells, thus suggesting that FAEs antagonise the effects of ATP by preventing the activation of the pyroptotic molecular cascade leading to cell death. These results indicate that FAEs are endowed with anti-pyroptotic activity, which may contribute to their therapeutic effects.",Dimethyl fumarate | Macrophages | Pyroptosis,16,0,UNITO,undefined,Università degli Studi di Torino,citing papers,0,2015-06

This is unlikely due to increased mitochondrial production but rather to extramitochondrial sources such as NADPH oxidase or xanthine oxidase. We have reported a xanthine oxidase-mediated increase in ROS production in many experimental models from isolated cells to humans. Originally, ROS were considered as detrimental and thus as a likely cause of cell damage associated with exhaustion. In the past decade, evidence showing that ROS act as signals has been gathered and thus the idea that antioxidant supplementation in exercise is always recommendable has proved incorrect. In fact, we proposed that exercise itself can be considered as an antioxidant because training increases the expression of classical antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase and, in general, lowering the endogenous antioxidant enzymes by administration of antioxidant supplements may not be a good strategy when training. Antioxidant enzymes are not the only ones to be activated by training. Mitochondriogenesis is an important process activated in exercise. Many redox-sensitive enzymes are involved in this process. Important signaling molecules like MAP kinases, NF-κB, PGC-1α, p53, heat shock factor, and others modulate muscle adaptation to exercise. Interventions aimed at modifying the production of ROS in exercise must be performed with care as they may be detrimental in that they may lower useful adaptations to exercise.",muscle | PGC-1? | Redoxsignaling | Skeletal | Vitamins,103,0,EC,CM1001,European Commission,citing papers,0,2015-06

A multi-protein complex of the innate immune system, the NLRP3 inflammasome regulates cleavage and secretion of proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1b. The inflammasome detects various pathogen-Associated molecule patterns and damage-Associated molecule patterns, which then leads to a series of immune-inflammatory reactions. Methods: To explore the role of inflammasome activation in the underlying biological mechanisms of depression, we established a mouse model of depression with unpredictable chronic mild stress. Results: Mice subjected to chronic mild stress for 4 weeks had significantly higher serum corticosterone levels, serum interleukin- 1b levels, and hippocampal active interleukin-1b protein levels. They also displayed depressive-like symptoms, including decreased sucrose preference and increased immobility time. Moreover, the hippocampi of chronic mild stress-exposed mice had significantly higher activity of caspase-1, which accompanied by higher protein levels of NLRP3 and the apoptotic speckcontaining protein with a card. Pretreatment with the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor VX-765 decreased serum and hippocampal levels of interleukin-1b protein and significantly moderated the depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic mild stress. Conclusions: These data suggest the NLRP3 inflammasome mediates stress-induced depression via immune activation.

In this context, how intracellular pathogens such as Francisella activate the inflammasome is incompletely understood, particularly regarding the relative importance of priming versus activation steps. To better understand these events we compared Francisella strains that differ in virulence and ability to induce inflammasome activation for their relative effects on step one vs. step two. When using the rapid priming model, i.e., 30 min priming by live or heat killed Francisella strains (step 1), followed by ATP (step 2), we found no difference in IL-18 release, p20 caspase-1 release and ASC oligomerization between Francisella strains (F. novicida, F. holarctica -LVS and F. tularensis Schu S4). This priming is fast, independent of bacteria viability, internalization and phagosome escape, but requires TLR2-mediated ERK phosphorylation. In contrast to their efficient priming capacity, Francisella strains LVS and Schu S4 were impaired in inflammasome triggering compared to F. novicida.

Through the screening of NF-κB inhibitors by a luciferase reporter gene assay, we identified parthenolide (PAR) as the most potent NF-κB inhibitor, among several PAR analogue compounds. This study was undertaken to determine whether PAR inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production, cartilage degradation, and inflammatory arthritis. Method: The mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Proteoglycan content and release were determined by measuring glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels using the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) dye-binding assay. The potential role of PAR in treatment of arthritis was studied using a collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model. Results: We established that PAR, as a prototype compound, suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α-induced increases in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukin (IL)-1β mRNA in chondrocytes. In addition, PAR prevented proteoglycan degradation triggered by pro-inflammatory cytokines. PAR treatment at the onset of CIA symptoms significantly reduced synovitis, inflammation, and pannus formation scores. Reduced synovial inflammation after PAR treatment was also reflected in significantly less bone erosion and cartilage damage. Conclusions: These data indicate a protective effect of PAR on the catabolic insults of pro-inflammatory cytokines on chondrocyte metabolism and GAG release in vitro and in CIA. PAR had anti-inflammatory and structure-modifying effects on experimental arthritis, suggesting that PAR may be useful as a potential alternative or adjunct therapy for inflammatory arthritis.",,23,0,NHMRC,247909,National Health and Medical Research Council,citing papers,0,2015-05

TRXR and inflammasome activity promoted filopodia formation, cellular release of reduced TRX, and generation of extracellular thiol pathway- dependent, procoagulant microparticles (MPs). Additionally, inflammasome-induced activation of an intracellular caspase-1/ calpain cysteine protease cascade degraded filamin, thereby severing bonds between the cytoskeleton and tissue factor (TF), the cell surface receptor responsible for coagulation activation. This cascade enabled TF trafficking from rafts to filopodia and ultimately onto phosphatidylserine-positive, highly procoagulant MPs.

Although the function of inflammasomes in immune response and disease development is well studied, the molecular mechanism by which inflammasomes are activated and assembled remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that β-arrestin1, a key regulator of the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway, was required for nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and NLR family CARD domain-containing protein 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation, but it had no effect on absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome activation. Moreover, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) pyroptosome, which is ASC aggregation mediating caspase-1 activation, was also impaired in β-arrestin1-deficient macrophages upon NLRP3 or NLRC4, but not AIM2 inflammasome activation. Mechanistic study revealed that β-arrestin1 specifically interacted with NLRP3 and NLRC4 and promoted their self-oligomerization. In vivo, in a monosodium urate crystal (MSU)-induced NLRP3-dependent peritonitis model, MSU-induced IL-1β production and neutrophil flux were significantly reduced in β-arrestin1 knockout mice. Additionally, β-arrestin1 deficiency rescued the weight loss of mice upon logphase Salmonella typhimurium infection, with less IL-1β production. Taken together, our results indicate that β-arrestin1 plays a critical role in the assembly and activation of two major canonical inflammasomes, and it may provide a new therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases.",,17,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2015-02

Procaspase-1 autocatalyzes its cleavage and activation, resulting in maturation of the precursor forms of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 into active proinflammatory cytokines and initiation of pyroptotic cell death. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of diseases, including genetically inherited autoinflammatory conditions as well as chronic diseases in which NLRP3 is abnormally activated.

Death from sepsis is understood to be a complex process, driven by a lack of normal immune homeostatic functions and excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to multi-organ failure. The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, one of whose members was initially discovered in Drosophila, performs an important role in the recognition of microbial pathogens. These pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), upon sensing invading microorganisms, activate intracellular signal transduction pathways. NOD signaling is also involved in the recognition of bacteria and acts synergistically with the TLR family in initiating an efficient immune response for the eradication of invading microbial pathogens. TLRs and NOD1/NOD2 respond to different pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Modulation of both TLR and NOD signaling is an area of research that has prompted much excitement and debate as a therapeutic strategy in the management of sepsis.

We investigated the effect of parthenolide (PTL) on the chronic constriction injury to the sciatic nerve (CCI)-induced neuropathy in rat. We analyzed spinal changes in glial markers and M1 and M2 polarization factors, as well as intracellular signaling pathways. PTL (5 μg; i.t.) was preemptively and then daily administered for 7 days after CCI. PTL attenuated the allodynia and hyperalgesia and increased the protein level of IBA1 (a microglial/macrophage marker) but did not change GFAP (an astrocyte marker) on day 7 after CCI. PTL reduced the protein level of M1 (IL-1β, IL-18, and iNOS) and enhanced M2 (IL-10, TIMP1) factors. In addition, it downregulated the phosphorylated form of NF-κB, p38MAPK, and ERK1/2 protein level and upregulated STAT3. In primary microglial cell culture we have shown that IL-1β, IL-18, iNOS, IL-6, IL-10, and TIMP1 are of microglial origin. Summing up, PTL directly or indirectly attenuates neuropathy symptoms and promotes M2 microglia/macrophages polarization.

Therefore, agents that target discrete activation steps could represent very important drugs. We reported previously that ILG, a chalcone from Glycyrrhiza uralensis, inhibits LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Here, we show that ILG potently inhibits the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome, and the effect is independent of its inhibitory potency on TLR4. The inhibitory effect of ILG was stronger than that of parthenolide, a known inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. GL, a triterpenoid from G. uralensis, had similar inhibitory effects on NLRP3 activity, but high concentrations of GL were required. In contrast, activation of the AIM2 inflammasome was inhibited by GL but not by ILG. Moreover, GL inhibited NLRP3-and AIM2-activated ASC oligomerization, whereas ILG inhibited NLRP3-activated ASC oligomerization. Low concentrations of ILG were highly effective in IAPP-induced IL-1βproduction compared with the sulfonylurea drug glyburide. In vivo analyses revealed that ILG potently attenuated HFD-induced obesity, hypercholesterolemia, and insulin resistance.

The compilation of these and other factors in a given mechanistic context is sometimes referred to as the ""inflammome"". Humans and other higher-order mammals have evolved (over time) several discrete inflammomes to counter the effects of pathogens. However, when these inflammomes are induced inappropriately, they drive the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. The vast majority of biological anti-inflammatory treatments currently being developed are focused on the post hoc inhibition of downstream effectors by anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies and receptor antagonists. This prevailing ""end-point treatment"" has even directed a new disease classification paradigm, namely a cytokine-based disease classification, as opposed to a traditional diagnosis based on a particular tissue or organ system dysfunction. Although this approach has a number of advantages, it omits the processes that led to the generation of the inflammatory effectors in the first place. In this review, we will expand the cytokine-based disease taxonomy into an inflammome-based taxonomy that includes interventions that subvert a priori cytokine development and can complement post hoc inhibition.",Anti-inflammatory agents | Inflammation,2,0,NIAID,P01AI056172,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,citing papers,0,2014-11

Expression of E-cadherin is strongly reduced in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and its downregulation is connected to invasiveness and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinomas. The previous study showed that the supernatant from activated macrophages can downregulate the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. The partial known molecular mechanism is that tyrosine kinases c-Src- and EGFR phosphorylate β-catenin and E-cadherin leading to destabilization of E-cadherin/β-catenin complex. The aim of this study is to clarify other mechanism by which activated macrophages downregulate the expression of E-cadherin. We detect the expression of E-cadherin and macrophage infiltration in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues by double-staining immunohistochemistry and evaluate the relationship between macrophages and E-cadherin expression in hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro experiments. We found that reduced expression of E-cadherin was associated with macrophage infiltration along the border between the tumor nest and stroma in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues. Besides, protein expression of E-cadherin was significantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma cells co-cultured with macrophages derived from THP-1 cells. Consistently, mRNA expression of E-cadherin was also decreased in cancer cells co-cultured with THP-1-differentiated macrophages. Moreover, the downregulation of E-cadherin expression was companied by upregulation of Slug expression in cancer cells with conditional medium from THP-1-differentiated macrophage culture. The change in expression of E-cadherin and Slug was abrogated when NF–κB signaling pathway was blocked. All the findings suggested that macrophages contributed to the decreased expression of E-cadherin by NF–κB/Slug pathway in hepatocellular carcinomas.",E-Cadherin | Hepatocellular carcinoma | NF–κB | Tumor-associated macrophage,9,0,,81071705,,citing papers,0,2014-10

The activation of inflammasome pathways is linked to the pathogenesis of various prevalent disorders including cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis, ischemic injury, cardiomyopathy, and Kawasaki disease.

Key to many inflammatory diseases is the cytokine, Interleukin-1 (IL-1). Due to its apical role in initiating the inflammatory response, dysregulated IL-1 signalling results in a number of pathologies. Treatment of inflammatory diseases with anti-IL-1 therapies has offered many therapeutic benefits, however current therapies are protein based, with all the accompanying limitations. The non-conventional pathways involved in IL-1 signalling provide a number of potential therapeutic targets for clinical intervention and this has led to the exploitation of a number of model organisms for the study of IL-1 biology. Murine models have long been used to study IL-1 processing and release, but do not allow direct visualisation in vivo. Recently, fish models have emerged as genetically tractable and optically transparent inflammatory disease models. These models have raised questions on the evolutionary origins of the IL-1 family and the conservation in its processing and activation. Here we review the current understanding of IL-1 evolution in fish and discuss the study of IL-1 processing in these models. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Inflammasome | Inflammation | Interleukin-1 | Zebrafish,29,0,MRC,G0701932,Medical Research Council,citing papers,0,2014-01

We investigated the effects of inflammasome blockade in diabetes-related wound-healings defects, in genetically diabetic mice. Experimental Approach An incisional skin wound model was produced on the back of female diabetic C57BL/KsJ-m +/+ Leptdb mice (db+/db+) and their normal littermates (db +/m+). Animals were treated daily with two inflammasome blocking agents, BAY 11-7082 (20 mg·kg-1 i.p.), or Brilliant Blue G (BBG, 45.5 mg·kg-1 i.p.), or vehicle. Mice were killed on 3, 6 and 12 days after skin injury to measure expression of the NOD-like receptor NLRP3, caspase-1, VEGF, the inflammasome adapter protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) and the chemokine CXCL12. Wound levels of IL-1β and IL-18 were also measured, along with histological assessments of wound tissue and the time to complete wound closure. Key Results During healing, the diabetic mice exhibited increased activation of NLRP3, caspase-1, ASC, IL-1β and IL-18 they also showed a reduced expression of VEGF and CXCL12.Treatment with BAY 11-7082 or BBG, to block activation of the inflammasome, decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory molecules. Histological evaluation indicated that inflammasome blockade improved the impaired healing pattern, at day 12 in diabetic mice, along with a decreased time to complete skin healing. Conclusions and Implications These data strongly suggest that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is one of the key contributors to the delayed healing of wounds in diabetic mice. © 2013 The British Pharmacological Society.",diabetes | inflammasome | wound healing,45,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2014-01

A major response induced by several Gram-negative bacteria is the activation of caspase-1 via the Nlrc4 inflammasome. Upon activation, caspase-1 regulates the processing of proIL-1β and proIL-18 leading to the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18, and induction of pyroptosis. The activation of the Nlrc4 inflammasome requires the presence of an intact type III or IV secretion system that mediates the translocation of small amounts of flagellin or PrgJ-like rod proteins into the host cytosol to induce Nlrc4 activation. Using the Salmonella system, it was shown that Naip2 and Naip5 link flagellin and the rod protein PrgJ, respectively, to Nlrc4. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Nlrc4 at Ser533 by Pkcδ was found to be critical for the activation of the Nlrc4 inflammasome. Here, we show that Naip2 recognizes the Shigella T3SS inner rod protein MxiI and induces Nlrc4 inflammasome activation. The expression of MxiI in primary macrophages was sufficient to induce pyroptosis and IL-1β release, which were prevented in macrophages deficient in Nlrc4. In the presence of MxiI or Shigella infection, MxiI associated with Naip2, and Naip2 interacted with Nlrc4. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Naip2, but not Naip5, inhibited Shigella-induced caspase-1 activation, IL-1β maturation and Asc pyroptosome formation. Notably, the Pkcδ kinase was dispensable for caspase-1 activation and secretion of IL-1β induced by Shigella or Salmonella infection. These results indicate that activation of caspase-1 by Shigella is triggered by the rod protein MxiI that interacts with Naip2 to induce activation of the Nlrc4 inflammasome independently of the Pkcδ kinase. © 2014 Suzuki et al.",,65,1,NIAID,21?10053,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,citing papers,0,2014-01

We now show that caspase-3-mediated apoptosis accounts for the death of only a small fraction of CD4 T cells corresponding to those that are both activated and productively infected. The remaining over 95% of quiescent lymphoid CD4 T cells die by caspase-1-mediated pyroptosis triggered by abortive viral infection. Pyroptosis corresponds to an intensely inflammatory form of programmed cell death in which cytoplasmic contents and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, are released. This death pathway thus links the two signature events in HIV infection-CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation-and creates a pathogenic vicious cycle in which dying CD4 T cells release inflammatory signals that attract more cells to die. This cycle can be broken by caspase 1 inhibitors shown to be safe in humans, raising the possibility of a new class of 'anti-AIDS' therapeutics targeting the host rather than the virus. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Induction of NF-κB activation seems to be mediated through IKK, as transfection of cells with either IKKα or IKKβ siRNA prevented U46619-induced phosphorylation of IκB-α and NF-κBp65 DNA-binding activity. U46619 treatment to the cells also downregulated the TIMP-2 level. Pretreatment of the cells with SB203580 and Bay11-7082 did not show any discernible change in TIMP-2 level by U46619. Overall, U46619-induced activation of proMMP-2 is mediated via involvement of p38MAPK- NFκB-MT1MMP signaling pathway with concomitant downregulation of TIMP-2 expression in bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",MT1-MMP | NF-κB | p MAPK 38 | proMMP-2 | TIMP-2,6,0,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2014-01

NLRs are characterized by a central nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain found in P-loop NTPases. In this review, we detail the functional and structural properties of the NACHT domain of a subfamily of NLRs, the NLRPs (NLR containing a pyrin domain), based on previous studies, sequence analysis, homology modeling, and structure predictions. Several NLRPs have been found to regulate inflammatory responses through the assembly of oligomeric caspase 1-activating platforms known as inflammasomes, the 3-dimensional structure of the NLRP NACHT domain has still not been solved. Homology modeling suggests that sequence variability within the NACHT domains of different NLRP family members may alter the topology of the ATP-binding pocket. Based on this finding, we discuss the potential therapeutic prospects aligned with the NACHT domain and the development of selective inhibitors of inflammasome activity. © 2013 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.",NACHT domain | NLR | NLRP | nucleotide-binding | STAND ATPase,43,0,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2013-10

Parthenolide (PN) has been proved to elicit a wide range of biological activities through its anti-inflammatory action in the treatment of migraine, arthritis, and atherosclerosis. To decide whether this effect applies to ischemic injury in brain, we therefore investigate the potential neuroprotective role of PN and the underlying mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into Saline, Vehicle, and PN groups and a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used. PN administered intraperitoneally immediately after cerebral ischemia and once daily on the following days. At time points after MCAO, neurological deficit, infarct volume, and brain water content were measured. Immunohistochemistry, western blot and RT-PCR were used to analyze the expression of NF-B and caspase-1 in ischemic brain tissue. Phospho-p38MAPK and claudin-5 were detected by western blot. The results indicated that PN dramatically ameliorated neurological deficit, brain water content, and infarct volume, downregulated NF-B, phospho-p38MAPK, and caspase-1 expressions, and upregulated claudin-5 expression in ischemic brain tissue. Conclusions. PN protected the brain from damage caused by MCAO; this effect may be through downregulating NF-B, phosho-p38MAPK, and caspase-1 expressions and ameliorating BBB permeability. © 2013 Lipeng Dong et al.",,40,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2013-08

Here we show that amyloid fibrils of human lysozyme, which are associated with severe systemic amyloidoses, induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines through activation of the NLRP3 (NLR, pyrin domain containing 3) inflammasome and the Toll-like receptor 2, two innate immune receptors that may be involved in immune responses associated to amyloidoses. More importantly, our data clearly suggest that the induction of inflammatory responses by amyloid fibrils is linked to their intrinsic structure, because the monomeric form and a non-fibrillar type of lysozyme aggregates are both unable to trigger cytokine secretion. These lysozyme species lack the so-called cross-β structure, a characteristic structural motif common to all amyloid fibrils irrespective of their origin. Since fibrils of other bacterial and endogenous proteins have been shown to trigger immunological responses, our observations suggest that the cross-β structural signature might be recognized as a generic danger signal by the immune system. © 2013 Springer Basel.",Amyloid-induced inflammation | Cross-β structure | NLRP3 inflammasome | Toll-like receptors,30,0,MRC,IAP P6/19,Medical Research Council,citing papers,0,2013-08

Furthermore, reactive oxygen species generation or a change in cell volume was not necessary for NLRP3 activation. Instead, the only common activity induced by all NLRP3 agonists was the permeation of the cell membrane to K+ and Na+. Notably, reduction of the intracellular K+ concentration was sufficient to activate NLRP3, whereas an increase in intracellular Na+ modulated but was not strictly required for inflammasome activation. These results provide a unifying model for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in which a drop in cytosolic K+ is the common step that is necessary and sufficient for caspase-1 activation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..",,985,1,NIH,5 R25 GM086262,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2013-06

Aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting from disruption of either PTP or PTK function, has been shown to be the cause of major human diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Consequently, the characterization of small-molecule inhibitors of these kinases and phosphatases may not only provide molecular probes with which to define the significance of particular signaling events, but also may have therapeutic implications. BAY-11-7082 is an anti-inflammatory compound that has been reported to inhibit IκB kinase activity. The compound has an α,β-unsaturated electrophilic center, which confers the property of being a Michael acceptor; this suggests that it may react with nucleophilic cysteine-containing proteins, such as PTPs. In this study, we demonstrated that BAY-11-7082 was a potent, irreversible inhibitor of PTPs. Using mass spectrometry, we have shown that BAY-11-7082 inactivated PTPs by forming a covalent adduct with the active-site cysteine. Administration of the compound caused an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation in RAW 264 macrophages, similar to the effects of the generic PTP inhibitor sodium orthovanadate. These data illustrate that BAY-11-7082 is an effective pan-PTP inhibitor with cell permeability, revealing its potential as a new probe for chemical biology approaches to the study of PTP function. Furthermore, the data suggest that inhibition of PTP function may contribute to the many biological effects of BAY-11-7082 that have been reported to date.

THP-1 non-adherent human monocytic cells differentiate into plastic-adherent macrophages via α vβ3 integrin, by ERK activation in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). This has proven to be a valuable model for investigating functional monocyte/macrophage diversity. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is a Th1-cytokine that is crucial in macrophage activation. In this study, we investigated the effects of IFN-γ on adhesion and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells. IFN-γ is incapable of inducing cell attachment and TNF production; however, it cumulatively upregulated PMA-induced basal adhesion and TNF production. IFN-γ increased αV integrin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression and among these PMA-induced cell surface adhesion molecules, the blocking antibody for αV integrin suppressed adhesion and TNF production. Furthermore, IFN-γ enhanced PMA-induced NF-κB phosphorylation and not ERK phosphorylation. Accordingly, the NF-κB pathway inhibitor (BAY 11-7082) inhibited the enhancing effect of IFN-γ on adhesion and TNF production. By contrast, the MEK inhibitor (U0126) almost completely eliminated PMA-induced basal adhesion and TNF production.

Human periodontal ligament tissue-derived MSCs (PDLSCs) have been isolated, and their differentiation potential was found to be defective due to b-catenin signaling indirectly regulated by inflammatory microenvironments. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is well studied in inflammation by many different groups. The role of NF-κB needs to be studied in PDLSCs, although genetic evidences have recently shown that NF-κB inhibits osteoblastic bone formation in mice. However, the mechanism as to how inflammation leads to the modulation of β-catenin and NF-κB signaling remains unclear. In this study, we investigated b-catenin and NF-κB signaling through regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3b activity (GSK-3b, which modulates b-catenin and NF-κB signaling) using a specific inhibitor LiCl and a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY 294002. We identified that NF-κB signaling might be more important for the regulation of osteogenesis in PDLSCs from periodontitis compared with β-catenin. BAY 11-7082 (an inhibitor of NF-κB) could inhibit phosphorylation of p65 and partly rescue the differentiation potential of PDLSCs in inflammation. Our data indicate that NF-κB has a central role in regulating osteogenic differentiation of PDLSCs in inflammatory microenvironments. Given the molecular mechanisms of NF-κB in osteogenic differentiation governed by inflammation, it can be said that NF-κB helps in improving stem cell-mediated inflammatory bone disease therapy. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",GSK-3β | Inflammation | NF-κB | Osteogenic differentiation | Periodontal ligament stem cell,76,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2013-02

Here we show that nitric oxide (NO) inhibited the NLRP3-mediated ASC pyroptosome formation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in myeloid cells from both mice and humans. Meanwhile, endogenous NO derived from iNOS (inducible form of NO synthase) also negatively regulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Depletion of iNOS resulted in increased accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in response to LPS and ATP, which was responsible for the increased IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation. iNOS deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of NO production enhanced NLRP3-dependent cytokine production in vivo, thus increasing mortality from LPS-induced sepsis in mice, which was prevented by NLRP3 deficiency. Our results thus identify NO as a critical negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome via the stabilization of mitochondria.

Assembly of this complex is triggered by a range of structurally diverse damage or pathogen associated stimuli, and the signaling pathways through which these act are poorly understood. Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. It can be reversed by deubiquitinase enzymes (DUBs) that remove ubiquitin moieties from the protein thus modifying its fate. DUBs present specificity toward different ubiquitin chain topologies and are crucial for recycling ubiquitin molecules before protein degradation as well as regulating key cellular processes such as protein trafficking, gene transcription, and signaling.Wereport here that small molecule inhibitors of DUB activity inhibit inflammasome activation. Inhibition of DUBs blocked the processing and release of IL-1β in both mouse and human macrophages.DUBactivity was necessary for inflammasome association as DUB inhibition also impairedASColigomerization and caspase-1 activation without directly blocking caspase-1 activity.

Inflammasome activation results in the recruitment and activation of caspase-1, which is required for the production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) and IL-18 that can modulate both adaptive and innate immune responses through effects on leukocyte survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Recent studies suggest that inflammasome activity may also play important roles in several nonmicrobial disease states associated with chronic inflammation. For example, NLRP3 inflammasome expression and IL-1ß production are both increased in obesity, and recent work has implicated NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a variety of obesity-linked conditions including gout, type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic liver disease, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. Further, many of the factors associated with these conditions, including elevated plasma glucose, fatty acids, uric acid and cholesterol crystals, and ß-amyloid, have been shown to be elevated during obesity and to stimulate NLRP3 inflammasome expression or activation. Since chronic NLRP3 activation appears to play important roles in several common disease states, better understanding of inflammasome regulation and function may lead to better therapeutic approaches. Several agents that attenuate NLRP3 inflammasome activity or inhibit its primary effector, IL-1ß, are currently under development or in early clinical trials as therapeutics to treat these common disease conditions. This chapter will review new research on inflammasome activation, its role in obesity and other chronic inflammatory states, and the status of approaches to attenuate NLRP3 inflammasome activity.",,5,0,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2013-01

The inflammasome is one of the most critical arms of host innate immunity, which is a protein complex controlling maturation of IL-1β. To clarify whether T. schoenleinii is able to activate the inflammasome, we analyzed human monocytic cell line THP-1 for IL-1β production upon infection with T. schoenleinii strain isolated from Tinea favosa patients, and rapid IL-1β secretion from THP-1 cells was observed. Moreover, applying competitive inhibitors and gene specific silencing with shRNA, we found that T. schoenleinii induced IL-1β secretion, ASC pyroptosome formation as well as caspase-1 activation were all dependent on NLRP3. Cathepsin B activity, ROS production and K+ efflux were required for the inflammasome activation by T. schoenleinii.

TAT-mediated secretion appreciably contributes to virulence in both animal and plant models of bacterial infection. Consequently, TAT function is an attractive target for small-molecular-weight compounds that alone or in conjunction with extant antimicrobial agents could become novel therapeutics. The TAT-transported hemolytic phospholipase C (PlcH) of P. aeruginosa and its multiple orthologs produced by the above pathogens can be detected by an accurate and reproducible colorimetric assay using a synthetic substrate that detects phospholipase C activity. Such an assay could be an effective indicator of TAT function. Using carefully constructed recombinant strains to precisely control the expression of PlcH, we developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to evaluate, in duplicate, >80,000 small-molecular-weight compounds as possible TAT inhibitors. Based on additional TAT-related functional assays, purified PlcH protein inhibition experiments, and repeat experiments of the initial screening assay, 39 compounds were selected from the 122 initial hits. Finally, to evaluate candidate inhibitors for TAT specificity, we developed a TAT titration assay that determines whether inhibition of TAT-mediated secretion can be overcome by increasing the levels of TAT expression. The compounds N-phenyl maleimide and Bay 11-7082 appear to directly affect TAT function based on this approach. Copyright © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

We found that a decrease in extracellular osmolarity induced a K+-dependent conformational change of the preassembled NLRP3-inactive inflammasome during cell swelling, followed by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1, which was controlled by transient receptor potential channels during RVD. Both mechanisms were necessary for interleukin-1β processing. Increased extracellular osmolarity prevented caspase-1 activation by different known NLRP3 activators. Collectively, our data identify cell volume regulation as a basic conserved homeostatic mechanism associated with the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and reveal a mechanism for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",,230,1,WT,11922/PI/09,Fundación Séneca,citing papers,0,2012-09

However, the combined effect of geldanamycin and parthenolide on epithelial ovarian cancer cells has not been studied. In respect of cell death process, we investigated the promoting effect of parthenolide on geldanamycin-induced apoptosis in the human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines OVCAR-3 and SK-OV-3. Geldanamycin induced a decrease in Bid, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and survivin protein levels; an increase in Bax and tumour suppressor p53 levels; loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential; cytochrome c release; activation of caspases (-8, -9 and -3); cleavage of PARP-1; and increase in the reactive oxygen species formation. Parthenolide enhanced geldanamycin-induced changes in the apoptosis-related protein levels, reactive oxygen species formation, nuclear damage and cell death. The combined effect was inhibited by the addition of oxidant scavengers. The results suggest that parthenolide may potentiate the apoptotic effect of geldanamycin on ovarian carcinoma cell lines by the activation of the caspase-8- and Bid-dependent pathway and the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. The apoptosis-promoting effect seems to be mediated by the stimulatory effect on the formation of reactive oxygen species. © 2012 Nordic Pharmacological Society.",,13,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2012-09

In our search for new entities with anti-inflammatory potential, the extracts of the whole plant of Saussurea heteromalla (family-Asteraceae), collected from Himalayas, were evaluated in the high throughput screen for TNF-α and IL-6 inhibitors. The extract blocked TNF-α and IL-6 production in LPS stimulated THP-1 cells (human acute monocyte leukemia cell line) completely at 10 and 30 μg/ml. The plant has been found as a new source of chlorojanerin, a guaianolide type of sesquiterpene lactone. Chlorojanerin was shown to be significantly effective in inhibiting TNF-α and IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells (IC50 = 2.3 ± 0.2 μM and 1.8 ± 0.7 μM respectively). The compound also blocked TNF-α and IL-6 production from LPS-stimulated human monocytes (IC50 = 1.5 ± 0.4 and 0.7 ± 0.2 μM respectively) and synovial cells from a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (IC50 < 0.03 and 0.5 μM respectively). Transcriptional profiling of the LPS stimulated THP-1 cells revealed that chlorojanerin exerted its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the expression of 8 genes involved in activating the transcription factor - NF-κB. Real time analysis of these genes validated the effect of chlorojanerin on the classical downstream targets of NF-κB. Thus, this study clearly delineated 8 genes which were specifically mitigated due to the effect of chlorojanerin on NF-κB induced signaling at the mRNA level. Further, chlorojanerin at 5 μM also inhibited the binding of NF-κB in a GFP reporter assay system by 55.5% thus validating the microarray gene expression data. This work is a step towards the isolation and characterization of lead anti-inflammatory agents from the extract of Saussurea heteromalla, which can be developed into better therapeutic molecules targeted towards some specific inflammatory diseases. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

The pathogenesis of CINCA syndrome patients who carry NLRP3 mutations as somatic mosaicism has not been precisely described because of the difficulty in separating individual cells based on the presence or absence of the mutation. Here we report the generation of NLRP3-mutant and nonmutant-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from 2 CINCA syndrome patients with somatic mosaicism, and describe their differentiation into macrophages (iPS-MPs). We found that mutant cells are predominantly responsible for the pathogenesis in these mosaic patients because only mutant iPSMPs showed the disease relevant phenotype of abnormal IL-1β secretion. We also confirmed that the existing antiinflammatory compounds inhibited the abnormal IL-1β secretion, indicating that mutant iPS-MPs are applicable for drug screening for CINCA syndrome and other NLRP3-related inflammatory conditions. Our results illustrate that patient-derived iPSCs are useful for dissecting somatic mosaicism and that NLRP3-mutant iPSCs can provide a valuable platform for drug discovery for multiple NLRP3-related disorders. © 2012 by The American Society of Hematology.",,42,1,JSPS,22249042,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,citing papers,0,2012-08

Primary and cancerous (RAW264.7 cells) macrophages were activated by lipopolysaccharide, a ligand of toll-like receptor 4. As reported previously, BAY strongly suppressed the production of nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and tumor necrosis factor-α and reduced the translocation of p65, major subunit of nuclear factor-κB, and its upstream signaling events such as phosphorylation of IκBα, IKK, and Akt. In addition, BAY also suppressed the translocation and activation of activator protein-1, interferon regulatory factor-3, and signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 by inhibiting the phosphorylation or activation of extracellular signal-related kinase, p38, TANK-binding protein, and Janus kinase-2.

Ethanol and neuroinflammation are known to reduce neurogenesis. We have found that ethanol induces neuroinflammation supporting the hypothesis that ethanol induction of neuroinflammation contributes to ethanol inhibition of neurogenesis. To identify the key proinflammatory molecule that may be responsible for ethanol-impaired neurogenesis we used an ex vivo model of organotypic hippocampal-entorhinal cortex brain slice cultures. Here, we demonstrated a key role of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β signaling in mediating ethanol inhibition of neurogenesis. Ethanol inhibition of neurogenesis was reversed by neutralizing antibody to IL-1β or blockade of the IL-1β receptor with antagonist IL-1RIa. Ethanol-impaired neurogenesis is associated with strong induction of IL-1β and inflammasome proteins NALP1 and NALP3 in both neurons and astrocytes. Blockade of IL-1β synthesis with inflammasome inhibitors Parthenolide and Bay11708 significantly reversed ethanol inhibited neurogenesis. Furthermore, we also found that IL-1β and inflammasome proteins NALP1 and NALP3 are increased in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes in postmortem alcoholic human brain. Together, these novel findings demonstrate that targeting inflammasome-IL-1β signaling can normalize ethanol-impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, which may have therapeutic implications for treatment of cognitive impairment associated with hippocampal dysfunction in alcoholics. © 2012 Zou and Crews.",Alcohol | Brain slice culture | Il-1β | Inflammasomes | neurogenesis | Neuroprogenitors,89,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2012-06

Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) is a key inflammatory mediator. Secretion of biologically active IL-1β involves inflammasome-mediated processing. Little is known about the contribution of IL-1β and the inflammasomes in CF inflammatory disease. This study examines inflammasome-mediated IL-1β production in CF bronchial epithelial cell lines and human patients with CF. Results: Bronchial epithelial cell lines were found to produce negligible amounts of basal or stimulated IL-1β compared to hematopoeitic cells and they did not significantly upregulate caspase-1 activity upon inflammasome stimulation. In contrast, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from both CF and healthy control subjects produced large amounts of IL-1β and strongly upregulated caspase-1 activity upon inflammasome stimulation. PBMCs from CF patients and controls displayed similar levels of caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production when stimulated with inflammasome activators. This IL-1β production was dependent on NF-κB activity and could be enhanced by priming with LPS. Finally, chemical inhibition of CFTR activity in control PBMCs and THP-1 cells did not significantly alter IL-1β or IL-8 production in response to P. aeruginosa. Conclusion: Hematopoeitic cells appear to be the predominant source of inflammasome-induced pro-inflammatory IL-1β in CF. PBMCs derived from CF subjects display preserved inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in response to the major CF pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, our data do not support the hypothesis that increased IL-1β production in CF subjects is due to an intrinsic increase in NF-κB activity through loss of CFTR function. © 2012 Tang et al.",,48,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2012-05

NF-κB pathway is one of the central machinery initiating and propagating inflammatory responses. The present study envisaged the involvement of NF-κB inflammatory cascade in the pathophysiology of diabetic neuropathy using BAY 11-7082, an IκB phosphorylation inhibitor. Streptozotocin was used to induce diabetes in Sprauge Dawley rats. BAY 11-7082 (1 & 3 mg/kg) was administered to diabetic rats for 14 days starting from the end of six weeks post diabetic induction. Diabetic rats developed deficits in nerve functions and altered nociceptive parameters and also showed elevated expression of NF-κB (p65), IκB and p-IκB along with increased levels of IL-6 & TNF-α and inducible enzymes (COX-2 and iNOS). Furthermore, there was an increase in oxidative stress and decrease in Nrf2/HO-1 expression. We observed that BAY 11-7082 alleviated abnormal sensory responses and deficits in nerve functions. BAY 11-7082 also ameliorated the increase in expression of NF-κB, IκB and p-IκB. BAY 11-7082 curbed down the levels of IL-6, TNF-α, COX-2 and iNOS in the sciatic nerve. Lowering of lipid peroxidation and improvement in GSH levels was also seen along with increased expression of Nrf2/HO-1. Thus it can be concluded that NF-κB expression and downstream expression of proinflammatory mediators are prominent features of nerve damage leading to inflammation and oxidative stress and BAY 11-7082 was able to ameliorate experimental diabetic neuropathy by modulating neuroinflammation and improving antioxidant defence. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Inflammasomes may operate at the cell-autonomous level to eliminate malignant precursors through programmed cell death or, conversely, may stimulate the production of trophic factors for cancer cells and their stroma. In inflammatory cells, caspase-1 activation can fuel a cycle that leads to sterile inflammation and carcinogenesis, whereas in antigen-presenting cells, inflammasomes can stimulate anticancer immune responses. The inhibition of inflammasomes or neutralization of their products, mainly interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, has profound effects on carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Thus, inflammasomes are promising therapeutic targets in cancer-related clinical conditions.

IL-1β secretion requires the protease caspase-1, which is activated following recruitment to inflammasomes. Endogenous danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from necrotic cells activate caspase-1 through an NLRP3-inflammasome. Here, we show that the endogenous lipid metabolite sphingosine (Sph) acts as a DAMP by inducing the NLRP3-inflammasome-dependent secretion of IL-1β from macrophages. This process was dependent upon serine/threonine protein phosphatases since the PP1/PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A inhibited Sph-induced IL-1β release. IL-1β release induced by other well-characterized NLRP3-inflammasome activators, such as ATP and uric acid crystals, in addition to NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasome activators was also blocked by these inhibitors. Thus, we propose Sph as a new DAMP, and that a serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1/PP2A)-dependent signal is central to the endogenous host mechanism through which diverse stimuli regulate inflammasome activation. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Many innate immune receptors take part in the inflammatory response and induce transcriptional activation leading to the production of a host of cytokines, chemokines and other inflammatory mediators. The IL-1β cytokines are exceptional in that they not only require transcriptional activation but also a proteolytic processing into biologically active cytokines. This activation step is mediated by caspase-1, which in turn is controlled by cytosolic multimolecular complexes named inflammasomes. The NLRP3 inflammasome responds to aggregated or crystalline material, as well as to microbes or pore-forming toxins, but activation mechanisms are not fully understood. The importance of this innate signaling complex is highlighted by the existence of several mechanisms that regulate NLRP3 activation at different levels.

Previous studies identified a class of diarylsulfonylurea containing compounds called Cytokine Release Inhibitory Drugs (CRIDs) that inhibited the post-translational processing of IL-1β. Further work identified Glutathione S-Transferase Omega 1 (GSTO1) as a possible target of these CRIDs. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the inhibitory activity of the CRID CP-456,773 (termed CRID3) in light of recent advances in the area of inflammasome activation, and to clarify the potential role of GSTO1 in the regulation of IL-1β production. Methodology and Results: In murine bone marrow derived macrophages, CRID3 inhibited IL-1β secretion and caspase 1 processing in response to stimulation of NLRP3 and AIM2 but not NLRC4. CRID3 also prevented AIM2 dependent pyroptosis in contrast to the NLRP3 inhibitors glyburide and parthenolide, which do not inhibit AIM2 activation. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting assays indicated that CRID3 inhibited the formation of ASC complexes or 'specks' in response to NLRP3 and AIM2 stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation assays show that GSTO1 interacted with ASC. Significance: These results identify CRID3 as a novel inhibitor of the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes and provide an insight into the mechanism of action of this small molecule. In addition GSTO1 may be a component of the inflammasome that is required for ASC complex formation. © 2011 Coll, O'Neill.",,103,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2011-12

Methods: Cultured THP-1 (acute monocytic leukemia cell line) cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone (control group), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), LPS plus apigenin (25/50 μmol/L) or LPS plus Z-VAD (a caspase inhibitor). The supernatant was harvested and the content of secreted interleukin (IL)-1β was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effects of apigenin on the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-caspase-1 were determined by Western blot. And the effect of apigenin on the nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation was detected by reporter gene assay. Results: MTT assays showed that the cytotoxicity of apigenin was low. Apigenin could significantly inhibit the LPS-induced secretion of IL-1β in THP-1 cells. The concentration of IL-1β was (362 ± 64) pg/ml in the control group, (1549 ± 320) pg/ml in the LPS group, (397 ± 150) pg/ml in the LPS plus 25 μmol/L apigenin group and (268 ± 142) pg/ml in the LPS plus 50 μmol/L apigenin group (P <0.05). The results of Western blot indicated that apigenin inhibited the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-caspase-1. It could also inhibit the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB. The value of relative light unit was 0.6 ± 0.1 in the control group, 32.7 ± 0.8 in the LPS group, 12.9 ± 1.8 in the LPS plus 25 μmol/L apigenin group and 10.0 ± 3.2 in the LPS plus 50 μmol/L apigenin group respectively (P < 0.05).

We sought to determine whether human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP), the main component of islet amyloid, might contribute to islet inflammation by recruiting and activating macrophages. Early aggregates of hIAPP, but not nonamyloidogenic rodent islet amyloid polypeptide, caused release of CCL2 and CXCL1 by islets and induced secretion of TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL10 by C57BL/6 bone marrow-derived macrophages. hIAPP-induced TNF-α secretion was markedly diminished in MyD88-, but not TLR2- or TLR4-deficient macrophages, and in cells treated with the IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) anakinra. To determine the significance of IL-1 signaling in hIAPP-induced pancreatic islet dysfunction, islets from wild-type or hIAPP-expressing transgenic mice were transplanted into diabetic NOD/SCID recipients implanted with mini-osmotic pumps containing IL-1Ra (50 mg/kg/d) or saline. IL-1Ra significantly improved the impairment in glucose tolerance observed in recipients of transgenic grafts 8 wk following transplantation. Islet grafts expressing hIAPP contained amyloid deposits in close association with F4/80-expressing macrophages. Transgenic grafts contained 50% more macrophages than wild-type grafts, an effect that was inhibited by IL-1Ra. Our results suggest that hIAPP-induced islet chemokine secretion promotes macrophage recruitment and that IL-1R/MyD88, but not TLR2 or TLR4 signaling is required for maximal macrophage responsiveness to prefibrillar hIAPP. These data raise the possibility that islet amyloid-induced inflammation contributes to β cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes and islet transplantation.

Here we report that ESAT-6-promoted necrotic death in THP-1 human macrophages is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome, as shown by RNA interference and pharmacological inhibitions. Phagosomes containing ESAT-6-expressing M. tuberculosis recruit markers previously associated with damaged phagosomal membrane, such as galectin-3 and ubiquitinated protein aggregates. In addition, ESAT-6 promoted lysosomal permeabilization by M. tuberculosis. ESAT-6 mutants defective for ubiquitination were unable to trigger NLRP3 activation and necrotic death. Furthermore, Syk tyrosine kinase, recently implicated in NLRP3 activation during fungal and malarial infections, was necessary for mediating the ESAT-6-promoted necrosis and NLRP3 activation. Our results thus link phagosomal damage and Syk activity to NLRP3-mediated necrotic death triggered by M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 during infection. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,133,1,NIAID,R22AI026170,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,citing papers,0,2011-09

The substances interfere with the activation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor NFκB, by inhibiting NFκB directly (parthenolide) or by interfering with the inactivation of the NFκB inhibitory protein IκB-α (Bay 11-7082). Beyond that, the substances may be effective in part by nongenomic effects. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may undergo apoptosis-like cell death (eryptosis) characterized by cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine exposure, and cell shrinkage. Thus, erythrocytes allow the study of nongenomic mechanisms contributing to suicidal cell death, e.g. Ca 2+ leakage or glutathione depletion. The present study utilized Western blotting to search for NFκB and IκB-α expression in erythrocytes, FACS analysis to determine cytosolic Ca 2+ (Fluo3 fluorescence), phosphatidylserine exposure (annexin V binding), and cell volume (forward scatter), as well as an enzymatic method to determine glutathione levels. As a result, both NFκB and IκB-α are expressed in erythrocytes. Targeting the NFκB pathway by Bay 11-7082 (IC 50 ≈ 10 μM) and parthenolide (IC 50 ≈ 30 μM) triggered suicidal erythrocyte death as shown by annexin V binding and decrease of forward scatter. Bay 11-7082 treatment further increased intracellular Ca 2+ and led to depletion of reduced glutathione. The effects of Bay 11-7082 and parthenolide on annexin V binding could be fully reversed by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. In conclusion, the pharmacological inhibitors of NFκB, Bay 11-7082 and parthenolide, interfere with the survival of erythrocytes involving mechanisms other than disruption of NFκB-dependent gene expression. © 2011 S.

RelBlo DCs, generated in the presence of an nuclear factor-κB inhibitor, induce T-regulatory (Treg) cells and suppress inflammation in a model of rheumatoid arthritis. Interleukin (IL)-1β is overexpressed in humans and mice at risk of type 1 diabetes, dysregulates Treg cells, and accelerates diabetes in NOD mice. We investigated the relationship between IL-1β production and the response to RelBlo DCs in the prediabetic period. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We injected RelBlo DCs subcutaneously into 4- or 14-week-old NOD mice and tracked the incidence of diabetes and effect on Treg cell function. We measured the expression of proinflammatory cytokines by stimulated splenocytes and unstimulated islets from mice of different ages and strains and proliferative and cytokine responses of T effectors to Treg in vitro. RESULTS: Tolerizing RelBlo DCs significantly inhibited diabetes progression when administered to 4-week-old but not 14-week-old mice. IL-1β production by NOD splenocytes and mRNA expression by islets increased from 6 to 16 weeks of age when major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted islet antigen presentation to autoreactive T-cells occurred. IL-1 reduced the capacity of Treg cells to suppress effector cells and promoted their conversion to Th17 cells. RelBlo DCs exacerbated the IL-1-dependent decline in Treg function and promoted Th17 conversion. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1β, generated by islet-autoreactive cells in MHC-susceptible mice, accelerates diabetes by differentiating Th17 at the expense of Treg. Tolerizing DC therapies can regulate islet autoantigen priming and prevent diabetes, but progression past the IL-1β/IL-17 checkpoint signals the need for other strategies. © 2011 by the American Diabetes Association.",,26,1,,undefined,,citing papers,0,2011-01

Recent data impressively demonstrate that activating mutations in a human gene involved in proIL-1β maturation or loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) cause excessive activity of this cytokine. This can result in life-threatening systemic and local inflammation, particularly in the skin. Interestingly, experiments in mice revealed that epidermal keratinocytes can secrete large amounts of IL-1α, which induces an inflammatory response in the skin. Secretion of IL-1 requires caspase-1 activity, and activation of the protease takes place in innate immune complexes, called inflammasomes. As keratinocytes express and activate caspase-1 in an inflammasome-dependent manner, these epithelial cells might be critically involved in the innate immunity of the skin. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on IL-1 and inflammasomes in the skin, particularly their involvement in skin homeostasis and disease. In addition, we discuss the hypothesis that keratinocytes are not only static bricks of the epidermal wall, but immunologically active cells critically involved in different (auto)-inflammatory (skin) diseases. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.",Caspase-1 | IL-1 | Inflammasome | Inflammation | Skin,109,0,ESF,31EM30-126141,European Science Foundation,citing papers,0,2010-09

Inflammation and hence the innate immune response to chlamydial infection contributes significantly to tissue damage, particularly by secreting proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β from monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. Here we demonstrate that C. trachomatis or Chlamydia muridarum infection of a monocytic cell line leads to caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion through a process requiring the NLRP3 inflammasome. Thus, secretion of IL-1β decreased significantly when cells were depleted of NLRP3 or treated with the anti-inflammatory inhibitors parthenolide or Bay 11-7082, which inhibit inflammasomes and the transcription factor NF-κB. As for other infections causing NRLP3 inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation in monocytes is triggered by potassium efflux and reactive oxygen species production. However, anti-oxidants inhibited IL-1β secretion only partially. Atypically for a bacterial infection, caspase-1 activation during chlamydial infection also involves partially the spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which is usually associated with a pathogen recognition receptor for fungal pathogens. Secretion of IL-1β during infection by many bacteria requires both microbial products from the pathogen and an exogenous danger signal, but chlamydial infection provides both the pathogen-associated molecular patterns and danger signals necessary for IL-1β synthesis and its secretion from human monocytes. Use of inhibitors that target the inflammasome in animals should therefore dampen inflammation during chlamydial infection. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Chlamydia | Inflammasome | Innate immunity | Monocytes | Nod-like receptor,69,0,NIH,R01AI079004,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,0,2010-08
