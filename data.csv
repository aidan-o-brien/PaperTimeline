The locus coeruleus (LC), a small nucleus in the pons of the brainstem, is widely recognized as one of the earliest sites of neurofibrillary tangle formation in AD. Patients with AD exhibit significant neuronal loss in the LC, resulting in a marked reduction of its size and function. The LC, which vastly innervates several regions of the brain, is the primary source of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) in the central nervous system. Considering that NE is a major modulator of behavior, contributing to neuroprotection and suppression of neuroinflammation, degeneration of the LC in AD and the ultimate dysregulation of the LC–NE system has detrimental effects in the brain. In this review, we detail the neuroanatomy and function of the LC, its essential role in neuroprotection, and how this is dysregulated in AD. We discuss AD-related neuropathologic changes in the LC and mechanisms by which LC neurons are selectively vulnerable to insult. Further, we elucidate the neurotoxic effects of LC de-innervation both locally and at projection sites, and how this augments disease pathology, progression and severity. We summarize how preservation of the LC–NE system could be used in the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases affected by LC degeneration.",Alzheimer’s disease | Locus coeruleus | Norepinephrine | Selective vulnerability | Tau,5,1,NIA,20a22,National Institute on Aging,origin paper,0,2021-05-01

The hippocampus and cortex are selectively vulnerable in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), however the degree of involvement of the different brain regions differs among patients. We classified corticolimbic patterns of neurofibrillary tangles in postmortem tissue to capture extreme and representative phenotypes. We combined bulk RNA sequencing with digital pathology to examine hippocampal vulnerability in AD. We identified hippocampal gene expression changes associated with hippocampal vulnerability and used machine learning to identify genes that were associated with AD neuropathology, including SERPINA5, RYBP, SLC38A2, FEM1B, and PYDC1. Further histologic and biochemical analyses suggested SERPINA5 expression is associated with tau expression in the brain.

In frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the high expressing TMEM106B risk haplotype was shown to increase susceptibility for FTD with TDP-43 inclusions (FTD-TDP) and to modify disease penetrance in progranulin mutation carriers (FTD-GRN). To elucidate the biological function of TMEM106B and determine whether lowering TMEM106B may be a viable therapeutic strategy, we performed brain transcriptomic analyses in 8-month-old animals from our recently developed Tmem106b-/- mouse model. We included 10 Tmem106b+/+ (wild-type), 10 Tmem106b+/- and 10 Tmem106-/- mice. The most differentially expressed genes (153 downregulated and 60 upregulated) were identified between Tmem106b-/- and wild-type animals, with an enrichment for genes implicated in myelination-related cellular processes including axon ensheathment and oligodendrocyte differentiation. Co-expression analysis also revealed that the most downregulated group of correlated genes was enriched for myelination-related processes. We further detected a significant loss of OLIG2-positive cells in the corpus callosum of Tmem106b-/- mice, which was present already in young animals (21 days) and persisted until old age (23 months), without worsening. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed a reduction of differentiated but not undifferentiated oligodendrocytes cellular markers. While no obvious changes in myelin were observed at the ultrastructure levels in unchallenged animals, treatment with cuprizone revealed that Tmem106b-/- mice are more susceptible to cuprizone-induced demyelination and have a reduced capacity to remyelinate, a finding which we were able to replicate in a newly generated Tmem106b CRISPR/cas9 knock-out mouse model. Finally, using a TMEM106B HeLa knock-out cell line and primary cultured oligodendrocytes, we determined that loss of TMEM106B leads to abnormalities in the distribution of lysosomes and PLP1. Together these findings reveal an important function for TMEM106B in myelination with possible consequences for therapeutic strategies aimed at lowering TMEM106B levels.",cuprizone | lysosome trafficking | myelin | oligodendrocytes | TMEM106B,11,1,NIH,R35 NS097261,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2020-06-01

We established the international FTLD-TDP whole-genome sequencing consortium to thoroughly characterize the known genetic causes of FTLD-TDP and identify novel genetic risk factors. Through the study of 1131 unrelated Caucasian patients, we estimated that C9orf72 repeat expansions and GRN loss-of-function mutations account for 25.5% and 13.9% of FTLD-TDP patients, respectively. Mutations in TBK1 (1.5%) and other known FTLD genes (1.4%) were rare, and the disease in 57.7% of FTLD-TDP patients was unexplained by the known FTLD genes. To unravel the contribution of common genetic factors to the FTLD-TDP etiology in these patients, we conducted a two-stage association study comprising the analysis of whole-genome sequencing data from 517 FTLD-TDP patients and 838 controls, followed by targeted genotyping of the most associated genomic loci in 119 additional FTLD-TDP patients and 1653 controls. We identified three genome-wide significant FTLD-TDP risk loci: one new locus at chromosome 7q36 within the DPP6 gene led by rs118113626 (p value = 4.82e − 08, OR = 2.12), and two known loci: UNC13A, led by rs1297319 (p value = 1.27e − 08, OR = 1.50) and HLA-DQA2 led by rs17219281 (p value = 3.22e − 08, OR = 1.98). While HLA represents a locus previously implicated in clinical FTLD and related neurodegenerative disorders, the association signal in our study is independent from previously reported associations. Through inspection of our whole-genome sequence data for genes with an excess of rare loss-of-function variants in FTLD-TDP patients (n ≥ 3) as compared to controls (n = 0), we further discovered a possible role for genes functioning within the TBK1-related immune pathway (e.g., DHX58, TRIM21, IRF7) in the genetic etiology of FTLD-TDP. Together, our study based on the largest cohort of unrelated FTLD-TDP patients assembled to date provides a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape of FTLD-TDP, nominates novel FTLD-TDP risk loci, and strongly implicates the immune pathway in FTLD-TDP pathogenesis.",DPP6 | HLA | Immunity | TBK1 | UNC13A | Whole-genome sequencing FTLD-TDP,35,0,NIH,K01 AG049152,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2019-06-01

We determined whether there are distinct TDP-43 types in non-FTLD brains. From a cohort of 553 brains (Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage 0–VI), excluding cases meeting criteria for FTLD, we identified those that had screened positive for TDP-43. We reviewed 14 different brain regions in these TDP-43 positive cases and classified them into those with “typical” TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions (TDP type-α), and those in which TDP-43 immunoreactivity was adjacent to/associated with NFTs in the same neuron (TDP type-β). We compared pathological, genetic (APOE4, TMEM106B and GRN variants), neuroimaging and clinical data between types, as well as compared neuroimaging between types and a group of TDP-43 negative cases (n = 309). Two-hundred forty-one cases were classified as TDP type-α (n = 131, 54%) or TDP type-β (n = 110, 46%). Type-α cases were older than type-β at death (median 89 years vs. 87 years; p = 0.02). Hippocampal sclerosis was present in 78 (60%) type-α cases and 16 (15%) type-β cases (p < 0.001). Type-α cases showed a pattern of widespread TDP-43 deposition commonly extending into temporal, frontal and brainstem regions (84% TDP-43 stage 4–6) while in type-β cases deposition was predominantly limbic, located in amygdala, entorhinal cortex and subiculum of the hippocampus (84% TDP-43 stages 1–3) (p < 0.001). There was a difference in the frequency of TMEM106B protective (GG) and risk (CC) haplotypes (SNP rs3173615 encoding p.T185S) in type-α cases compared to type-β cases (GG/CG/CC: 8%/42%/50% vs. 24%/49%/27%; p = 0.01). Type-α cases had smaller amygdala (− 10.6% [− 17.6%, − 3.5%]; p = 0.003) and hippocampal (− 14.4% [− 21.6%, − 7.3%]; p < 0.001) volumes on MRI at death compared to type-β cases, although both types had smaller amygdala and hippocampal volumes compared to TDP-43 negative cases (− 7.77%, − 21.6%; p < 0.001).

TMEM106B encodes a type II transmembrane protein with unknown function. Genetic variants in TMEM106B associated with reduced TMEM106B levels have been identified as disease modifiers in individuals with GRN mutations and C9ORF72 expansions. Recently, loss of Tmem106b has been reported to protect the FTLD-like phenotypes in Grn-/- mice. Here, we generated Tmem106b-/- mice and examined whether loss of Tmem106b could rescue FTLD-like phenotypes in an AAV mouse model of C9ORF72-repeat induced toxicity. Our results showed that neither partial nor complete loss of Tmem106b was able to rescue behavioral deficits induced by the expression of (GGGGCC)66 repeats (66R). Loss of Tmem106b also failed to ameliorate 66R-induced RNA foci, dipeptide repeat protein formation and pTDP-43 pathological burden. We further found that complete loss of Tmem106b increased astrogliosis, even in the absence of 66R, and failed to rescue 66R-induced neuronal cell loss, whereas partial loss of Tmem106b significantly rescued the neuronal cell loss but not neuroinflammation induced by 66R. Finally, we showed that overexpression of 66R did not alter expression of Tmem106b and other lysosomal genes in vivo, and subsequent analyses in vitro found that transiently knocking down C9ORF72, but not overexpression of 66R, significantly increased TMEM106B and other lysosomal proteins. In summary, reducing Tmem106b levels failed to rescue FTLD-like phenotypes in a mouse model mimicking the toxic gain-of-functions associated with overexpression of 66R. Combined with the observation that loss of C9ORF72 and not 66R overexpression was associated with increased levels of TMEM106B, this work suggests that the protective TMEM106B haplotype may exert its effect in expansion carriers by counteracting lysosomal dysfunction resulting from a loss of C9ORF72.",,13,1,NIH,P01NS084974,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2018-05-01

Subsequent genetic association analyses showed an increased burden of TIA1 LCD mutations in ALS patients compared to controls (p = 8.7 × 10−6). Postmortem neuropathology of five TIA1 mutations carriers showed a consistent pathological signature with numerous round, hyaline, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive inclusions. TIA1 mutations significantly increased the propensity of TIA1 protein to undergo phase transition. In live cells, TIA1 mutations delayed stress granule (SG) disassembly and promoted the accumulation of non-dynamic SGs that harbored TDP-43. Moreover, TDP-43 in SGs became less mobile and insoluble. The identification of TIA1 mutations in ALS/FTD reinforces the importance of RNA metabolism and SG dynamics in ALS/FTD pathogenesis.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | frontotemporal dementia | frontotemporal lobar degeneration | liquid-liquid phase separation | low-complexity domain | membrane-less organelle | stress granules | T cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1 | TDP-43,275,1,HHMI,U01AG006576,Howard Hughes Medical Institute,papers by authors,0,2017-08-01

Sleep is critical to the maintenance of homeostatic and circadian function, and chronic sleep disturbances have significant cognitive and physical health consequences that likely exacerbate disease severity. Sleep-wake cycles are regulated by neuromodulatory centers located in the brainstem, the hypothalamus, and the basal forebrain, many of which are vulnerable to the accumulation of abnormal protein deposits associated with neurodegenerative conditions. In AD, while sleep disturbances are commonly attributed to the accumulation of amyloid beta, patients often first experience sleep issues prior to the appearance of amyloid beta plaques, on a timeline that more closely corresponds to the first appearance of abnormal tau neurofibrillary tangles in sleep/wake regulating areas of the brainstem. Sleep disturbances also occur in pure tauopathies, providing further support that tau is a major contributor. Here, we provide an overview of the neuroanatomy of sleep/wake centers discovered in animal models, and review the evidence that tau-driven neuropathology is a primary driver of sleep disturbance in AD.",Alzheimer's disease | Human | Neuropathology | Progressive supranuclear palsy | Sleep-promoting | Tauopathies | Wake-promoting,0,0,NIH,K24053435,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2021-12-01

We compared the diagnostic value of both biomarkers in cognitively unimpaired participants and patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease syndromes, or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) syndromes. Methods: In this retrospective multicohort diagnostic performance study, we analysed plasma samples, obtained from patients aged 18–99 years old who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease syndromes (Alzheimer's disease dementia, logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, or posterior cortical atrophy), FTLD syndromes (corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia, or semantic variant primary progressive aphasia), or mild cognitive impairment; the participants were from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Memory and Aging Center, San Francisco, CA, USA, and the Advancing Research and Treatment for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Consortium (ARTFL; 17 sites in the USA and two in Canada). Participants from both cohorts were carefully characterised, including assessments of CSF p-tau181, amyloid-PET or tau-PET (or both), and clinical and cognitive evaluations. Plasma p-tau181 and p-tau217 were measured using electrochemiluminescence-based assays, which differed only in the biotinylated antibody epitope specificity. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to determine diagnostic accuracy of both plasma markers using clinical diagnosis, neuropathological findings, and amyloid-PET and tau-PET measures as gold standards. Difference between two area under the curve (AUC) analyses were tested with the Delong test. Findings: Data were collected from 593 participants (443 from UCSF and 150 from ARTFL, mean age 64 years [SD 13], 294 [50%] women) between July 1 and Nov 30, 2020. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 were correlated (r=0·90, p<0·0001). Both p-tau217 and p-tau181 concentrations were increased in people with Alzheimer's disease syndromes (n=75, mean age 65 years [SD 10]) relative to cognitively unimpaired controls (n=118, mean age 61 years [SD 18]; AUC=0·98 [95% CI 0·95–1·00] for p-tau217, AUC=0·97 [0·94–0·99] for p-tau181; pdiff=0·31) and in pathology-confirmed Alzheimer's disease (n=15, mean age 73 years [SD 12]) versus pathologically confirmed FTLD (n=68, mean age 67 years [SD 8]; AUC=0·96 [0·92–1·00] for p-tau217, AUC=0·91 [0·82–1·00] for p-tau181; pdiff=0·22). P-tau217 outperformed p-tau181 in differentiating patients with Alzheimer's disease syndromes (n=75) from those with FTLD syndromes (n=274, mean age 67 years [SD 9]; AUC=0·93 [0·91–0·96] for p-tau217, AUC=0·91 [0·88–0·94] for p-tau181; pdiff=0·01). P-tau217 was a stronger indicator of amyloid-PET positivity (n=146, AUC=0·91 [0·88–0·94]) than was p-tau181 (n=214, AUC=0·89 [0·86–0·93]; pdiff=0·049). Tau-PET binding in the temporal cortex was more strongly associated with p-tau217 than p-tau181 (r=0·80 vs r=0·72; pdiff<0·0001, n=230). Interpretation: Both p-tau217 and p-tau181 had excellent diagnostic performance for differentiating patients with Alzheimer's disease syndromes from other neurodegenerative disorders. There was some evidence in favour of p-tau217 compared with p-tau181 for differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease syndromes versus FTLD syndromes, as an indication of amyloid-PET-positivity, and for stronger correlations with tau-PET signal. Pending replication in independent, diverse, and older cohorts, plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 could be useful screening tools to identify individuals with underlying amyloid and Alzheimer's disease tau pathology.

Still, sleep and wake disorders are often misdiagnosed and undertreated in typical AD. Better characterization of sleep-wake features in AD clinical variants is an unmet gap of high importance because these differing patterns may require tailored treatment strategies.

Results: At diagnosis, women with bvFTD showed greater atrophy burden in the frontotemporal regions compared to men despite similar clinical characteristics. For a similar amount of atrophy, women demonstrated better-than-expected scores on executive function and fewer changes in apathy, sleep, and appetite than men. Discussion: Our findings suggest that women might have greater behavioral and executive reserve than men, and neurodegeneration must be more severe in women to produce symptoms similar in severity to those in men.",cognitive reserve | diagnosis | frontotemporal dementia | magnetic resonance imaging | neuroimaging | progression | resilience | survival,4,1,NIH,SLT002/16/00408,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2021-08-01

Early-onset Alzheimer's disease, defined as manifesting before age 65, is viewed as a relatively pure form of Alzheimer's disease with a more homogeneous neuropathological substrate. We sought to compare the frequency of common neuropathological diagnoses in a consecutive autopsy series of 96 patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (median age of onset = 55 years, 44 females) and 48 with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (median age of onset = 73 years, 14 females). The UCSF Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank database was reviewed to identify patients with a primary pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Prevalence and stage of Lewy body disease, limbic age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), argyrophilic grain disease, hippocampal sclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and vascular brain injury were compared between the two cohorts. We found at least one non-Alzheimer's disease pathological diagnosis in 98% of patients with early-onset Alzheimer's disease (versus 100% of late onset), and the number of comorbid diagnoses per patient was lower in early-onset than in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (median = 2 versus 3, Mann-Whitney Z = 3.00, P = 0.002). Lewy body disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy were common in both early and late onset Alzheimer's disease (cerebral amyloid angiopathy: 86% versus 79%, Fisher exact P = 0.33; Lewy body disease: 49% versus 42%, P = 0.48, respectively), although amygdala-predominant Lewy body disease was more common in early than late onset Alzheimer's disease (22% versus 6%, P = 0.02). In contrast, LATE (35% versus 8%, P < 0.001), hippocampal sclerosis (15% versus 3%, P = 0.02), argyrophilic grain disease (58% versus 41%, P = 0.052), and vascular brain injury (65% versus 39%, P = 0.004) were more common in late than in early onset Alzheimer's disease, respectively. The number of co-pathologies predicted worse cognitive performance at the time of death on Mini-Mental State Examination [1.4 points/pathology (95% confidence interval, CI-2.5 to-0.2) and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (1.15 point/pathology, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.84)], across early and late onset cohorts. The effect of sex on the number of co-pathologies was not significant (P = 0.17). Prevalence of at least one APOE ϵ4 allele was similar across the two cohorts (52% and 54%) and was associated with a greater number of co-pathologies (+0.40, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.79, P = 0.047), independent of age of symptom onset, sex, and disease duration. Females showed higher density of neurofibrillary tangles compared to males, controlling for age of onset, APOE ϵ4, and disease duration. Our findings suggest that non-Alzheimer's disease pathological diagnoses play an important role in the clinical phenotype of early onset Alzheimer's disease with potentially significant implications for clinical practice and clinical trials design.",Alzheimer's disease | Apo E | copathologies | early-onset | late-onset,5,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2021-07-01

However, the association between BMI and late-life obesity is controversial. Few studies have investigated the association between BMI and cognitive performance near the time of death using data from autopsy examination. We aimed to investigate the association between BMI and dementia in deceased individuals who underwent a full-body autopsy examination. Methods: Weight and height were measured before the autopsy exam. Cognitive function before death was investigated using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. The cross-sectional association between BMI and dementia was investigated using linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical variables. Results: We included 1,090 individuals (mean age 69.5 ± 13.5 years old, 46% women). Most participants (56%) had a normal BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), and the prevalence of dementia was 16%. Twenty-four percent of the sample had cancer, including 76 cases diagnosed only by the autopsy examination. Moderate and severe dementia were associated with lower BMI compared with participants with normal cognition in fully adjusted models (moderate: β = −1.92, 95% CI = −3.77 to −0.06, p = 0.042; severe: β = −2.91, 95% CI = −3.97 to −1.86, p < 0.001).

Prior case-control studies suggested that brain grey matter (GM) changes involving cortical (i.e, prefrontal areas) and subcortical structures (i.e, putamen, thalamus) could be associated with insomnia status. However, it remains unclear whether there is a gradient association between these regions and the severity of insomnia in older adults who could be at risk for dementia. Since depressive symptoms and sleep apnea can both feature insomniarelated factors, can impact brain health and are frequently present in older populations, it is important to include them when studying insomnia. Therefore, our goal was to investigate GM changes associated with insomnia severity in a cohort of healthy older adults, taking into account the potential effect of depression and sleep apnea as well. We hypothesized that insomnia severity is correlated with 1) cortical regions responsible for regulation of sleep and emotion, such as the orbitofrontal cortex and, 2) subcortical regions, such as the putamen. Methods 120 healthy subjects (age 74.8±5.7 years old, 55.7% female) were recruited from the Hillblom Healthy Aging Network at the Memory and Aging Center, UCSF. All participants were determined to be cognitively healthy following a neurological evaluation, neuropsychological assessment and informant interview. Participants had a 3T brain MRI and completed the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Berlin Sleep Questionnaire (BA) to assess sleep apnea. Cortical thickness (CTh) and subcortical volumes were obtained by the CAT12 toolbox within SPM12. We studied the correlation of CTh and subcortical volumes with ISI using multiple regressions adjusted by age, sex, handedness and MRI scan type. Additional models adjusting by GDS and BA were also performed. Results ISI and GDS were predominantly mild (4.9±4.2 and 2.5±2.9, respectively) and BA was mostly low risk (80%). Higher ISI correlated with lower CTh of the right orbitofrontal, right superior and caudal middle frontal areas, right temporo-parietal junction and left anterior cingulate cortex (p<0.001, uncorrected FWE). When adjusting by GDS, right ventral orbitofrontal and temporo-parietal junction remained significant, and left insula became significant (p<0.001, uncorrected FWE). Conversely, BA showed no effect. The results were no longer significant following FWE multiple comparisons. Regarding subcortical areas, higher putamen volumes were associated with higher ISI (p<0.01). Conclusions Our findings highlight a relationship between insomnia severity and brain health, even with relatively mild insomnia, and independent of depression and likelihood of sleep apnea. The results extend the previous literature showing the association of specific GM areas (i.e, orbitofrontal, insular and temporo-parietal junction) not just with the presence of insomnia, but across the spectrum of severity itself. Moreover, our results suggest subcortical structures (i.e., putamen) are involved as well. Longitudinal studies are needed to clarify how these insomnia-related brain changes in healthy subjects align with an increased risk of dementia Copyright:",,0,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2021-05-01

Histologic investigation showed that nearly all neurons in control brains display a pattern of diffuse cytoplasmic Rhes positivity. However, in the presence of abnormal tau, but not abnormal TDP-43, the patterns of neuronal cytoplasmic Rhes tend to present as either punctiform or entirely absent.

Few studies, however, have compared disease-related rates of psychosis prevalence in a large autopsy-based cohort, and it remains unclear how diseases differ with respect to the nature or content of the psychosis. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 372 patients with autopsy-confirmed neurodegenerative pathology: 111 with Alzheimer's disease, 59 with Lewy body disease and concomitant Alzheimer's disease, 133 with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with tau inclusions (including progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration or Pick's disease), and 69 with FTLD and TDP inclusions (FTLD-TDP, including types A-C). Psychosis content was classified by subtype, and the frequency of each subtype was compared among pathological diagnoses using logistic regression. A total of 111 of 372 patients had psychosis. Compared to other groups, patients with Lewy body disease/Alzheimer's disease pathology were significantly more likely to have hallucinations and were more likely to have more than one subtype of hallucination. Patients with Braak Parkinson stage 5-6 Lewy body disease were significantly more likely than those with no Lewy body disease to have visual hallucinations of misperception, peripheral hallucinations, hallucinations that moved, hallucinations of people/animals/objects, as well as delusions regarding a place and delusions of misidentification. The feeling of a presence occurred significantly more frequently in patients with Lewy body disease/Alzheimer's disease than all other pathologies. Patients with FTLD-TDP were significantly more likely to have delusions, and for the delusions to occur in the first 3 years of the disease, when compared to patients with Alzheimer's disease and FTLD-tau, though rates were not significantly greater than patients with Lewy body disease/Alzheimer's disease. Paranoia occurred more frequently in the FTLD-TDP and Lewy body disease/Alzheimer's disease categories compared to patients with Alzheimer's disease or FTLD-tau. Patients with FTLD-TDP pathology had delusions of misidentification as frequently as patients with Lewy body disease/Alzheimer's disease, and were significantly more likely to have self-elevating delusions such as grandiosity and erotomania compared to patients with other pathologies including FTLD-tau.

Objective: To assess the diagnostic and prognostic utility of 6 visual atrophy scales (VAS) and the Magnetic Resonance Parkinsonism Index (MRPI). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this diagnostic/prognostic study, data from 235 patients with bvFTD and 225 age- and magnetic resonance imaging-matched control individuals from 3 centers were collected from December 1, 1998, to September 30, 2019. One hundred twenty-one participants with bvFTD had high confidence of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) (bvFTD-HC), and 19 had low confidence of FTLD (bvFTD-LC). Blinded clinicians applied 6 previously validated VAS, and the MRPI was calculated with a fully automated approach. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were also measured for comparison. Data were analyzed from February 1 to June 30, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes of this study were bvFTD-HC or a neuropathological diagnosis of 4-repeat (4R) tauopathy and the clinical deterioration rate (assessed by longitudinal measurements of Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes). Measures of cerebral atrophy included VAS scores, the bvFTD atrophy score (sum of VAS scores in orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, anterior temporal, medial temporal lobe, and frontal insula regions), the MRPI, and other computerized quantifications of cortical and subcortical volumes. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were calculated for the differentiation of participants with bvFTD-HC and bvFTD-LC and controls. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the ability of atrophy measures to estimate longitudinal clinical deterioration. Results: Of the 460 included participants, 296 (64.3%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 62.6 (11.4) years. The accuracy of the bvFTD atrophy score for the differentiation of bvFTD-HC from controls (AUROC, 0.930; 95% CI, 0.903-0.957) and bvFTD-HC from bvFTD-LC (AUROC, 0.880; 95% CI, 0.787-0.972) was comparable to computerized measures (AUROC, 0.973 [95% CI, 0.954-0.993] and 0.898 [95% CI, 0.834-0.962], respectively). The MRPI was increased in patients with bvFTD and underlying 4R tauopathies compared with other FTLD subtypes (14.1 [2.0] vs 11.2 [2.6] points; P <.001). Higher bvFTD atrophy scores were associated with faster clinical deterioration in bvFTD (1.86-point change in Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes score per bvFTD atrophy score increase per year; 95% CI, 0.99-2.73; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: Based on these study findings, in bvFTD, VAS increased the diagnostic certainty of underlying FTLD, and the MRPI showed potential for the detection of participants with underlying 4R tauopathies. These widely available measures of atrophy can also be useful to estimate longitudinal clinical deterioration..",,1,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2021-03-01

In a small cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, we previously found an atypical, neuroglial tauopathy in cases harboring a TMEM106B rs1990622 A/A genotype. To test whether TMEM106B genotype affects the risk of developing atypical tauopathy under a recessive genotype model (presence versus absence of two major alleles: A/A vs. A/G and G/G). We characterized the atypical tauopathy neuropathologically and determined its frequency by TMEM106B rs1990622 genotypes in 90 postmortem cases with a primary diagnosis of FTLD/ALS-TDP [mean age at death 65.5 years (±8.1), 40% female]. We investigated the effect of this new atypical tauopathy on demographics and clinical and neuropsychological metrics. We also genotyped TMEM106B in an independent series with phenotypically similar cases. Sixteen cases (16/90, 17.7 %) showed the temporal-predominant neuro-astroglial tauopathy, and 93.7% of them carried an A/A genotype (vs. ~35% in a population cohort). The odds ratio of FTLD/ALS-TDP individuals with the A/A genotype showing neuro-astroglial tauopathy was 13.9. Individuals with this tauopathy were older at onset (p = 0.01). The validation cohort had a similarly high proportion of rs1990622 A/A genotype. TDP-43 and tau changes co-occur in a subset of neurons. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that TMEM106B polymorphisms may modulate neurodegeneration.

METHODS: We measured plasma t-tau and NfL with the Simoa platform in 265 participants: 167 FTLD-S, 43 AD-S, and 55 healthy controls (HC), including 82 pathology-proven cases (50 FTLD-tau, 18 FTLD-TDP, 2 FTLD-FUS, and 12 AD) and 98 participants with amyloid PET. We compared cross-sectional and longitudinal biomarker concentrations between groups, their correlation with clinical measures of disease severity, progression, and survival, and cortical thickness. RESULTS: Plasma NfL, but not plasma t-tau, discriminated FTLD-S from HC and AD-S from HC. Both plasma NfL and t-tau were poor discriminators between FLTD-S and AD-S. In pathology-confirmed cases, plasma NfL was higher in FTLD than AD and in FTLD-TDP compared to FTLD-tau, after accounting for age and disease severity. Plasma NfL, but not plasma t-tau, predicted clinical decline and survival and correlated with regional cortical thickness in both FTLD-S and AD-S. The combination of plasma NfL with plasma t-tau did not outperform plasma NfL alone. CONCLUSION: Plasma NfL is superior to plasma t-tau for the diagnosis and prediction of clinical progression of FTLD-S and AD-S. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that plasma NfL has superior diagnostic and prognostic performance vs plasma t-tau in FTLD and AD.",,4,0,NIA,K08 AG052648,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2021-02-01

Besides its major role in the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), it conveys signals originating from the brain, and from the circulatory system, shaping brain function in health and in pathology. Previous studies in rodents have revealed altered transcriptome both during aging and in various diseases of the central nervous system, including Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, a high-throughput sequencing of the CP transcriptome was performed in postmortem samples of clinically healthy individuals aged 50’s through 80’s. The data shows an age-related profile, with the main changes occurring in the transition from the 50’s to the 60’s, stabilizing thereafter. Specifically, neuronal and membrane functions distinguish the transcriptome between the 50’s and the 60’s, while neuronal and axon development and extracellular structure organization differentiate the 50’s from the 70’s. These findings suggest that changes in the CP transcriptome occur early in the aging process.

To identify and characterize selectively vulnerable neuronal populations, we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex and the superior frontal gyrus—brain regions where neurofibrillary inclusions and neuronal loss occur early and late in AD, respectively—from postmortem brains spanning the progression of AD-type tau neurofibrillary pathology. We identified RORB as a marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex and subsequently validated their depletion and selective susceptibility to neurofibrillary inclusions during disease progression using quantitative neuropathological methods.

All of these systems use semi-quantitative scoring (4- or 5-tier scales) of Lewy pathology (LP; i.e., Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites) in defined cortical and subcortical areas. While these systems are widely used, some suffer from low inter-rater reliability and/or an inability to unequivocally classify all cases with LP. To address these limitations, we devised a new system, the LP consensus criteria (LPC), which is based on the McKeith system, but applies a dichotomous approach for the scoring of LP (i.e., “absent” vs. “present”) and includes amygdala-predominant and olfactory-only stages. α-Synuclein-stained slides from brainstem, limbic system, neocortex, and olfactory bulb from a total of 34 cases with LP provided by the Newcastle Brain Tissue Resource (NBTR) and the University of Pennsylvania brain bank (UPBB) were scanned and assessed by 16 raters, who provided diagnostic categories for each case according to Braak, McKeith, Leverenz, Beach, and LPC systems. In addition, using LP scores available from neuropathological reports of LP cases from UPBB (n = 202) and NBTR (n = 134), JT (UPBB) and JA (NBTR) assigned categories according to all staging systems to these cases. McKeith, Leverenz, and LPC systems reached good (Krippendorff’s α ≈ 0.6), while both Braak and Beach systems had lower (Krippendorff’s α ≈ 0.4) inter-rater reliability, respectively. Using the LPC system, all cases could be unequivocally classified by the majority of raters, which was also seen for 97.1% when the Beach system was used. However, a considerable proportion of cases could not be classified when using Leverenz (11.8%), McKeith (26.5%), or Braak (29.4%) systems. The category of neocortical LP according to the LPC system was associated with a 5.9 OR (p < 0.0001) of dementia in the 134 NBTR cases and a 3.14 OR (p = 0.0001) in the 202 UPBB cases. We established that the LPC system has good reproducibility and allows classification of all cases into distinct categories.

Methods: One hundred one participants underwent PIB and FDG PET during life and neuropathological assessment. PET scans were visually interpreted by 3 raters blinded to clinical information. PIB PET was rated as positive or negative for cortical retention, whereas FDG scans were read as showing an Alzheimer disease (AD) or non-AD pattern. Neuropathological diagnoses were assigned using research criteria. Majority visual reads were compared to intermediate–high AD neuropathological change (ADNC). Results: One hundred one participants were included (mean age = 67.2 years, 41 females, Mini-Mental State Examination = 21.9, PET-to-autopsy interval = 4.4 years). At autopsy, 32 patients showed primary AD, 56 showed non-AD neuropathology (primarily frontotemporal lobar degeneration [FTLD]), and 13 showed mixed AD/FTLD pathology. PIB showed higher sensitivity than FDG for detecting intermediate–high ADNC (96%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 89–100% vs 80%, 95% CI = 68–92%, p = 0.02), but equivalent specificity (86%, 95% CI = 76–95% vs 84%, 95% CI = 74–93%, p = 0.80). In patients with congruent PIB and FDG reads (77/101), combined sensitivity was 97% (95% CI = 92–100%) and specificity was 98% (95% CI = 93–100%). Nine of 24 patients with incongruent reads were found to have co-occurrence of AD and non-AD pathologies. Interpretation: In our sample enriched for younger onset cognitive impairment, PIB-PET had higher sensitivity than FDG-PET for intermediate–high ADNC, with similar specificity. When both modalities are congruent, sensitivity and specificity approach 100%, whereas mixed pathology should be considered when PIB and FDG are incongruent.

In this work, the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD) proposes an agenda for integration to deliver a Knowledge to Action Framework (KtAF). First, we summarize evidence-based strategies (epidemiology, genetics, biomarkers, clinical trials, nonpharmacological interventions, networking, and translational research) and align them to current global strategies to translate regional knowledge into transformative actions. Then we characterize key sources of complexity (genetic isolates, admixture in populations, environmental factors, and barriers to effective interventions), map them to the above challenges, and provide the basic mosaics of knowledge toward a KtAF. Finally, we describe strategies supporting the knowledge creation stage that underpins the translational impact of KtAF.",biomarkers | clinical trials | dementia | epidemiology | evidence-based recommendations | genetics | knowledge to action framework | Latin America | networking and translational research | nonpharmacological interventions,12,1,NIH,FB 0003,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2021-02-01

With age, there is also diminished function of the adaptive immune system, and modest decreases in circulating B- and T-lymphocytes. Lymphocytes traffic through the human brain and reside there in small numbers, but it is unknown how this changes with age. Thus we investigated whether B- and T-lymphocyte numbers change with age in the normal human brain. We examined 16 human subjects in a pilot study and then 40 human subjects from a single brain bank, ranging in age from 44–96 years old, using rigorous criteria for defining neuropathological changes due to age alone. We immunostained post-mortem cortical tissue for B- and T-lymphocytes using antibodies to CD20 and CD3, respectively. We quantified cell density and made a qualitative assessment of cell location in cortical brain sections, and reviewed prior studies. We report that density and location of both B- and T-lymphocytes do not change with age in the normal human cortex.

The objective of this study was to validate the associations between reduced neuronal synchrony within alpha oscillations and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) density in autopsy examination, in patients with AD. Methods: In a well-characterized clinicopathological cohort of AD patients (n = 13), we quantified neuronal synchrony within alpha (8–12 Hz) and delta-theta (2–8 Hz) oscillations, using magnetoencephalography during the disease course, within six selected neocortical and hippocampal regions, including angular gyrus, superior temporal gurus, middle frontal gyrus, primary motor cortex, CA1, and subiculum, and correlated these with regional NFT density quantified at histopathological examination. Results: Abnormal synchrony in alpha, but not in delta-theta, significantly predicted the NFT density at post mortem neuropathological examination. Discussion: Reduced alpha synchrony is a sensitive neurophysiological index associated with pathological tau, and a potential network biomarker for clinical trials, to gauge the extent of network dysfunction and the degree of rescue in treatments targeting tau pathways in AD.",alpha oscillations | Alzheimer's disease | magnetoencephalography | neurofibrillary tangle density | neuropathology | neurophysiology,0,0,NIH,AG062196,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2021-01-01

Additionally, morphological brain changes after exercising were reported in PD animal models. However, these lifestyle-related changes were not evaluated in postmortem brain tissue. Objective: We aimed to evaluate, by immunohistochemistry, astrocytes, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and structural proteins expression (neurofilaments and microtubules - MAP2) changes in postmortem brain samples of individuals with Lewy body pathology. Methods: Braak PD stage≥III samples, classified by neuropathology analysis, from The Biobank for Aging Studies were classified into active (n=12) and non-active (n=12) groups, according to physical activity lifestyle, and paired by age, sex and Braak staging. Substantia nigra and basal ganglia were evaluated. Results: Groups were not different in terms of age or gender and had similar PD neuropathological burden (p=1.00). We observed higher TH expression in the active group in the substantia nigra and the basal ganglia (p=0.04). Astrocytes was greater in the non-active subjects in the midbrain (p=0.03) and basal ganglia (p=0.0004). MAP2 levels were higher for non-active participants in the basal ganglia (p=0.003) and similar between groups in the substantia nigra (p=0.46). Neurofilament levels for non-active participants were higher in the substantia nigra (p=0.006) but not in the basal ganglia (p=0.24). Conclusion: Active lifestyle seems to promote positive effects on brain by maintaining dopamine synthesis and structural protein expression in the nigrostriatal system and decrease astrogliosis in subjects with the same PD neuropathology burden.",Aging | Astrocytes | Dopamine | Lewy bodies | Life style | Parkinson disease | Postmortem examination,0,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,4,2021-01-01

Hypertension and diabetes are widely recognized as risk factors for B-ASC. Recent research indicates other and more complex risk factors and pathogenetic mechanisms. Here, we describe aspects of the unique architecture of brain arterioles, histomorphologic features of B-ASC, relevant neuroimaging findings, epidemiology and association with aging, established genetic risk factors, and the co-occurrence of B-ASC with other neuropathologic conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE). There may also be complex physiologic interactions between metabolic syndrome (e.g., hypertension and inflammation) and brain arteriolar pathology. Although there is no universally applied diagnostic methodology, several classification schemes and neuroimaging techniques are used to diagnose and categorize cerebral small vessel disease pathologies that include B-ASC, microinfarcts, microbleeds, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). In clinical-pathologic studies that factored in comorbid diseases, B-ASC was independently associated with impairments of global cognition, episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed, and has been linked to autonomic dysfunction and motor symptoms including parkinsonism. We conclude by discussing critical knowledge gaps related to B-ASC and suggest that there are probably subcategories of B-ASC that differ in pathogenesis. Observed in over 80% of autopsied individuals beyond 80 years of age, B-ASC is a complex and under-studied contributor to neurologic disability.",Arteriosclerosis | cAVU | Neuroimaging | Neuropathology | Senescence | SVD,11,0,NIH,G0400074,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2021-01-01

This study aimed to verify if β-amyloid Alzheimer's disease-type burden was associated with lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD) and with current depressive symptoms in a large population-based autopsy study. Methods: : We included 1013 deceased subjects submitted to autopsy (mean age=74.3±11.6 years, 49% men) in a community sample. β-amyloid burden was measured in all cases based on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria for presence and density of neuritic plaques. Lifetime MDD was defined when at least one previous episode according to the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – DSM (SCID). Depressive symptoms and cognitive impairment were determined using the depression item of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (D-NPI>0) and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR>0.5) respectively. Results: : Lifetime MDD, late life depression (LLD) and current depressive symptoms were associated with cognitive impairment (p<0.001). Additionally, neuritic plaques were associated with cognitive impairment (p<0.001). Moderate or frequent neurite plaque density was not associated with MDD, LLD or current depressive symptoms in multiple logistic models adjusted for age, gender, and cognitive impairment. Limitations: : In this cross-sectional study, all neuropsychiatric and cognitive assessment were based on informant-report of deceased participants. Conclusions: : Different clinical depictions of depression were associated with dementia in this large community sample of elderly individuals with multiethnic backgrounds. Notwithstanding, they were unrelated to β-amyloid pathology in the brain areas studied.

Additionally, numerous studies indicate an altered synaptic function during disease progression. To gain new insights into the molecular processes underlying the alteration of synaptic function in PD, a proteomic study was performed. Therefore, synaptosomes were isolated by density gradient centrifugation from SNpc tissue of individuals at advanced PD stages (N = 5) as well as control subjects free of pathology (N = 5) followed by mass spectrometry-based analysis. In total, 362 proteins were identified and assigned to the synaptosomal core proteome. This core proteome comprised all proteins expressed within the synapses without regard to data analysis software, gender, age, or disease. The differential analysis between control subjects and PD cases revealed that CD9 antigen was overrepresented and fourteen proteins, among them Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), mitochondrial, 39S ribosomal protein L37, neurolysin, and Methionine-tRNA ligase (MARS2) were underrepresented in PD suggesting an alteration in mitochondrial translation within synaptosomes.",mitochondrial pathology | mitochondrial translation | Parkinson’s disease | proteomics | substantia nigra pars compacta | synaptosomes,2,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2020-12-01

Loss-of-function mutations in progranulin (GRN) are a major cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and brains from GRN carriers with FTD (FTD-GRN) exhibit signs of lysosomal dysfunction. Lysosomal dysfunction may induce compensatory increases in secretion of exosomes, EVs secreted from the endolysosomal system, so we hypothesized that progranulin insufficiency would increase EV levels in the brain. Methods: We analyzed levels and protein contents of brain EVs from Grn–/– mice, which model the lysosomal abnormalities of FTD-GRN patients. We then measured brain EVs in FTD-GRN patients. To assess the relationship of EVs with symptomatic disease, we measured plasma EVs in presymptomatic and symptomatic GRN mutation carriers. Results: Grn–/– mice had elevated brain EV levels and altered EV protein contents relative to wild-type mice. These changes were age-dependent, occurring only after the emergence of pathology in Grn–/– mice. FTD-GRN patients (n = 13) had elevated brain EV levels relative to controls (n = 5). Symptomatic (n = 12), but not presymptomatic (n = 7), GRN carriers had elevated plasma EV levels relative to controls (n = 8). Interpretation: These data show that symptomatic FTD-GRN patients have elevated levels of brain and plasma EVs, and that this effect is modeled in the brain of Grn–/– mice after the onset of pathology. This increase in EVs could influence FTD disease progression, and provides further support for EVs as potential FTD biomarkers.",exosome | extracellular vesicle | frontotemporal dementia | progranulin,2,1,NIA,K08AG052648,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,2,2020-12-01

In behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a disorder of social-emotional function, von Economo neurons (VENs), and fork cells are among the initial neuronal targets. These large layer 5 projection neurons are concentrated in the anterior cingulate and frontoinsular (FI) cortices, regions that anchor the salience network, a large-scale system linked to social-emotional function. Here, we studied patients with bvFTD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or both, given that these syndromes share common pathobiological and genetic factors. Our goal was to determine how neuron type-specific TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) pathobiology relates to atrophy in specific brain structures and to loss of emotional empathy, a cardinal feature of bvFTD. We combined questionnaire-based empathy assessments, in vivo structural MR imaging, and quantitative histopathological data from 16 patients across the bvFTD/ALS spectrum. We show that TDP-43 pathobiology within right FI VENs and fork cells is associated with salience network atrophy spanning insular, medial frontal, and thalamic regions.

Microglia can thus be expected to have similar cell sizes and even distribution both across brain structures and across species with different brain sizes. To test this hypothesis, we determined microglial cell densities (the inverse of cell size) using immunocytochemistry to Iba1 in samples of free cell nuclei prepared with the isotropic fractionator from brain structures of 33 mammalian species belonging to males and females of five different clades. We found that microglial cells constitute;7% of non-neuronal cells in different brain structures as well as in the whole brain of all mammalian species examined. Further, they vary little in cell density compared with neuronal cell densities within the cerebral cortex, across brain structures, across species within the same clade, and across mammalian clades. As a consequence, we find that one microglial cell services as few as one and as many as 100 neurons in different brain regions and species, depending on the local neuronal density. We thus conclude that the addition of microglial cells to mammalian brains is governed by mechanisms that constrain the size of these cells and have remained conserved over 200 million years of mammalian evolution.

Furthermore, stripping techniques require antibody-specific optimization, validation, and quality control steps. New method: Aiming to create protocols for multiplex localization of neurodegenerative-related processes, without the need for specialized equipment, we evaluated several antibody stripping techniques. We also recommend quality control steps to validate stripping efficacy and ameliorate concerns of cross-reactivity and false positives based on extensive testing. Results: A protocol using β-mercaptoethanol and SDS consistently enables reliable antibody stripping across multiple rounds of staining and minimizes the odds of cross-reactivity while preserving tissue adhesion and antigen integrity in human postmortem tissue. Comparison with existing methods: Our proposed method is optimal for standard lab settings and shows consistent efficacy despite the intricacies of suboptimal human postmortem tissue and the need to strip markers bound to highly aggregated proteins. Additionally, it incorporates quality control steps to validate antibody stripping. Conclusions: Multiplex immunofluorescence methods for studying neurodegenerative diseases in human postmortem tissue are feasible even in standard laboratories. Nevertheless, evaluation of stripping parameters during optimization and validation phases of experiments is prudent.",Immunofluorescence | Immunohistochemistry | Multiplex histology | Neuropathology | Postmortem human brain tissue,4,0,NIH,K24AG053435,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2020-06-01

With this growth and increasing use, appropriate implementation and interpretation are paramount. Various biomarkers feature nuanced differences in strengths, limitations, and biases that must be considered when investigating disease etiology and clinical utility. For example, neuropathological investigations of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis can fall in disagreement with conclusions reached by biomarker-based investigations. Considering the varied strengths, limitations, and biases of different research methodologies and approaches may help harmonize disciplines within the neurodegenerative disease field. Purpose of review: Along with separate review articles covering fluid and imaging biomarkers in this issue of Alzheimer's Research and Therapy, we present the result of a discussion from the 2019 Biomarkers in Neurodegenerative Diseases course at the University College London. Here, we discuss themes of biomarker use in neurodegenerative disease research, commenting on appropriate use, interpretation, and considerations for implementation across different neurodegenerative diseases. We also draw attention to areas where biomarker use can be combined with other disciplines to understand issues of pathophysiology and etiology underlying dementia. Lastly, we highlight novel modalities that have been proposed in the landscape of neurodegenerative disease research and care.",Alzheimer's disease | Amyloid | Biomarkers | Cerebrospinal fluid | Magnetic resonance imaging | Neurodegenerative diseases | Neurofilament light chain | Plasma biomarkers | Positron emission tomography | Tau,8,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2020-05-01

In this work, we describe clinical, genetic, neuroanatomical and neuropathological (only in one case) features of two patients with tv-FTD carrying C9orf72 repeat expansion. The first patient (AB) presented with a 1-year disease duration showing focal right anterior temporal lobe (ATL) atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The second patient (BC) came to medical attention 13 years after disease onset and showed a prominent bilateral ATL involvement. Both patients showed naming deficits, impairment in identifying known faces and proper names, and personality changes with new onset behavioral rigidity, and progressing language difficulties to single-word and sentence comprehension difficulties. They were classified as tv-FTD. Clinical, cognitive and MRI follow-up were performed. As cognitive impairment progressed, MRI atrophy worsened in ATL and frontotemporal areas in both patients. Both cases had clear family histories of neurological and/or psychiatric disease. Genetic testing revealed a C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion in both cases. BC passed away after 15 years of disease and autopsy showed the expected TDP-type B pathology.

The radiotracer fluorine F 18-labeled (18F)-flortaucipir (FTP) detects tau pathology in Alzheimer disease, and positron emission tomography (PET) with FTP shows elevated binding in individuals at risk for CTE. No study, however, has assessed the correlation between in vivo FTP PET and postmortem tau in CTE. Objective: To assess the regional association between in vivo FTP binding and postmortem tau pathology in a patient with pathologically confirmed CTE. Design, Setting, and Participants: A white male former National Football League player with 17 years of US football exposure was clinically diagnosed with traumatic encephalopathy syndrome at a neurology tertiary referral center. 18F-Fludeoxyglucose, carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh compound B, and FTP PET were performed 52 months prior to death, and magnetic resonance imaging, 50 months prior to death. Brain images were assessed qualitatively for abnormalities blinded to autopsy data. Autopsy was performed using a neurodegenerative research protocol. The FTP standardized uptake value ratios (inferior cerebellar gray reference region) and W-score (age-adjusted z-score) maps were compared with phosphorylated tau immunohistochemical analysis with monoclonal antibody CP13. Main Outcomes and Measures: Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between antemortem FTP PET and tau pathology at autopsy. Results: Flortaucipir uptake was distributed in a patchy, frontotemporal-predominant pattern that overlapped with regions showing neurodegeneration on magnetic resonance imaging and hypometabolism on 18F-fludeoxyglucose PET. Pathological assessment revealed stage 4 CTE; limbic argyrophilic grain disease; stage 2 limbic-predominant, age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy; and Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage 3. 18F-Flortaucipir W-maps matched areas of high postmortem tau burden in left fusiform and inferior temporal gyri and juxtacortical frontal white matter. High FTP W-scores with low tau burden were found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, motor cortex, and calcarine cortex. No regions with low FTP W-scores corresponded to areas with high pathological tau burden. A modest correlation, which did not reach statistical significance (ρ = 0.35, P =.17), was found between FTP standardized uptake value ratio and tau area fraction at the regional level. Conclusions and Relevance: In this patient, FTP PET findings during life showed a modest correspondence with postmortem pathology in CTE. These findings suggest that FTP may have limited utility as a tau biomarker in CTE.",,11,0,NIH,16-443577,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2020-04-01

Aging-related astrogliopathy (ARTAG) is a relatively recent term encompassing a broad array of tau deposition in astroglia outside the range of traditional tauopathies. White matter thorn-shaped astrocyte (WM-TSA) clusters, a specific ARTAG subtype, has been associated with atypical language presentation of AD in a small study lacking replication. To interrogate the impact of WM-TSA in modifying clinical phenotype in AD, we investigated a clinicopathologic sample of 83 persons with pure cortical AD pathology and heterogeneous clinical presentations.MethodsWe mapped WM-TSA presence and density throughout cortical areas and interrogated whether WM-TSA correlated with atypical AD presentation or worse performance in neuropsychological testing.ResultsWM-TSA was present in nearly half of the cases and equally distributed in typical and atypical AD presentations. Worsening language and visuospatial functions were correlated with higher WM-TSA density in language-related and visuospatial-related regions, respectively. These findings were unrelated to regional neurofibrillary tangle burden. Next, unsupervised clustering divided the participants into 2 groups: A high-WM-TSA (n = 9) and low-WM-TSA (n = 74) pathology signature. The high-WM-TSA group scored significantly worse in language but not in other cognitive domains.ConclusionsThe negative impact of WM-TSA pathology to language and possibly visuospatial networks suggests that WM-TSA is not as benign as other ARTAG types and may be explored as a framework to understand the mechanisms and impact of astrocytic tau deposition in AD in humans.",,10,0,NIH,R01AG056573,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2020-03-01

Although activation of brain insulin signaling has been shown to be neuroprotective, to preserve memory in AD models, and appears beneficial in patients, the role of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) remains incompletely understood. We found reduced active/inactive IGF1 ratio and increased IGF1R expression in postmortem hippocampal tissue from AD patients, suggesting impaired brain IGF1 signaling in AD. Active/inactive IGF-1 ratio was also reduced in the brains of mouse models of AD. We next investigated the possible protective role of IGF1 in AD models. We used a recombinant adenoviral vector, RAd-IGF1, to drive the expression of IGF1 in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures prior to exposure to AβOs, toxins that accumulate in AD brains and have been implicated in early synapse dysfunction and memory impairment. Cultures transduced with RAd-IGF1 showed decreased binding of AβOs to neurons and were protected against AβO-induced neuronal oxidative stress and loss of dendritic spines. Significantly, in vivo transduction with RAd-IGF1 blocked memory impairment caused by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of AβOs in mice. Our results demonstrate altered active IGF1 and IGF1R levels in AD hippocampi, and suggest that boosting brain expression of IGF1 may comprise an approach to prevent neuronal damage and memory loss in AD.",Adenovirus | Dementia | Hippocampus | Human brain | Insulin-like growth factor I | Memory,8,0,NIH,K24AG053435,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2020-03-01

We sought to compare antemortem 18F-flortaucipir PET to neuropathology in a consecutive series of patients with a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative conditions. Twenty patients were included [mean age at PET 61 years (range 34-76); eight female; median PET-to-autopsy interval of 30 months (range 4-59 months)]. Eight patients had primary Alzheimer's disease pathology, nine had non-Alzheimer tauopathies (progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, argyrophilic grain disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with MAPT mutations), and three had non-tau frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Using an inferior cerebellar grey matter reference, 80-100-min 18F-flortaucipir PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were created. Mean SUVRs were calculated for progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and neurofibrillary tangle Braak stage regions of interest, and these values were compared to SUVRs derived from young, non-autopsy, cognitively normal controls used as a standard for tau negativity. W-score maps were generated to highlight areas of increased tracer retention compared to cognitively normal controls, adjusting for age as a covariate. Autopsies were performed blinded to PET results. There was excellent correspondence between areas of 18F-flortaucipir retention, on both SUVR images and W-score maps, and neurofibrillary tangle distribution in patients with primary Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Patients with non-Alzheimer tauopathies and non-tau frontotemporal lobar degeneration showed a range of tracer retention that was less than Alzheimer's disease, though higher than age-matched, cognitively normal controls. Overall, binding across both tau-positive and tau-negative non-Alzheimer disorders did not reliably correspond with post-mortem tau pathology. 18F-flortaucipir SUVRs in subcortical regions were higher in autopsy-confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration than in controls, but were similar to values measured in Alzheimer's disease and tau-negative neurodegenerative pathologies. Quantification of 18F-flortaucipir SUVR images at Braak stage regions of interest reliably detected advanced Alzheimer's (Braak VI) pathology. However, patients with earlier Braak stages (Braak I-IV) did not show elevated tracer uptake in these regions compared to young, tau-negative controls. In summary, PET-toautopsy comparisons confirm that 18F-flortaucipir PET is a reliable biomarker of advanced Braak tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. The tracer cannot reliably differentiate non-Alzheimer tauopathies and may not detect early Braak stages of neurofibrillary tangle pathology.",Alzheimer's disease | Neurofibrillary tangle | Neuropathology | Positron emission tomography | Tau,14,0,NIA,R01-AG038791,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2020-01-01

Clinically, these patients are described with different terms, such as semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), semantic dementia (SD), or right temporal variant frontotemporal dementia (FTD) depending on whether the predominant symptoms affect language, semantic knowledge for object or people, or socio-emotional behaviors. ATL atrophy presents with various degrees of lateralization, with right-sided cases considered rarer even though estimation of their prevalence is hampered by the paucity of studies on well-characterized, pathology-proven cohorts. Moreover, it is not clear whether left and right variants show a similar distribution of atrophy within the ATL cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Here we study the largest cohort to-date of pathology-proven TDP-43-C cases diagnosed during life as svPPA, SD or right temporal variant FTD. We analyzed clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging data from 30 cases, a subset of which was followed longitudinally. Guided by recent structural and functional parcellation studies, we constructed four bilateral ATL regions of interest (ROIs). The computation of an atrophy lateralization index allowed the comparison of atrophy patterns between the two hemispheres. This led to an automatic, imaging-based classification of the cases as left-predominant or right-predominant. We then compared the two groups in terms of regional atrophy patterns within the ATL ROIs (cross-sectionally) and atrophy progression (longitudinally). Results showed that 40% of pathology proven cases of TDP-43-C diagnosed with a temporal variant presented with right-lateralized atrophy. Moreover, the findings of our ATL ROI analysis indicated that, irrespective of atrophy lateralization, atrophy distribution within both ATLs follows a medial-to-lateral gradient. Finally, in both left and right cases, atrophy appeared to progress to the contralateral ATL, and from the anterior temporal pole to posterior temporal and orbitofrontal regions. Taken together, our findings indicate that incipient right predominant ATL atrophy is common in TDP-43-C pathology, and that distribution of damage within the ATLs appears to be the same in left- and right- sided variants. Thus, regardless of differences in clinical phenotype and atrophy lateralization, both temporal variants of FTD should be viewed as a spectrum presentation of the same disease.",Anterior temporal lobe | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | FTLD-TDP type C | Semantic dementia | Semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia | Temporal variant,5,1,NIH,03-75271 DHS/ADP/ARCC,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2020-01-01

The assay detected seeds in 106–109-fold dilutions of 4R tauopathy brain tissue but was orders of magnitude less responsive to brain with other types of tauopathy, such as from Alzheimer’s disease cases. The analytical sensitivity for synthetic 4R tau fibrils was ~ 50 fM or 2 fg/sample. A novel dimension of this tau RT-QuIC testing was the identification of three disease-associated classes of 4R tau seeds; these classes were revealed by conformational variations in the in vitro amplified tau fibrils as detected by thioflavin T fluorescence amplitudes and FTIR spectroscopy. Tau seeds were detected in postmortem cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from all neuropathologically confirmed PSP and CBD cases but not in controls. CSF from living subjects had weaker seeding activities; however, mean assay responses for cases clinically diagnosed as PSP and CBD/corticobasal syndrome were significantly higher than those from control cases.

Increasing experimental evidence suggests that misfolded disease proteins exhibit prion-like properties, including the ability to seed corruptive templating and self-propagation along axons. Direct evidence for transneuronal spread in patients, however, remains limited. To test predictions made by the transneuronal spread hypothesis in human tissues, we asked whether tau deposition within axons of the corticospinal and corticopontine pathways can be predicted based on clinical syndromes and cortical atrophy patterns seen in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Sixteen patients with Pick’s disease, 21 with corticobasal degeneration, and 3 with FTLD-MAPT were included, spanning a range of clinical syndromes across the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum. Cortical involvement was measured using a neurodegeneration score, a tau score, and a composite score based on semiquantitative ratings and complemented by an MRI-based cortical atrophy W-map based on antemortem imaging. Midbrain cerebral peduncle and pontine base descending fibers were divided into three subregions, representing prefrontopontine, corticospinal, and parieto-temporo-occipital fiber pathways. Tau area fraction was calculated in each subregion and related to clinical syndrome and cortical measures. Within each clinical syndrome, there were predicted relationships between cortical atrophy patterns and axonal tau deposition in midbrain cerebral peduncle and pontine base. Between syndromes, contrasting and predictable patterns of brainstem axonal tau deposition emerged, with, for example, greater tau in prefrontopontine fibers in behavioral variant FTD and in corticospinal fibers in corticobasal syndrome.

Most pathogenic GRN mutations result in progranulin haploinsufficiency, which is thought to cause frontotemporal dementia in GRN mutation carriers. Progranulin haploinsufficiency may drive frontotemporal dementia pathogenesis by disrupting lysosomal function, as patients with GRN mutations on both alleles develop the lysosomal storage disorder neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and frontotemporal dementia patients with GRN mutations (FTD-GRN) also accumulate lipofuscin. The specific lysosomal deficits caused by progranulin insufficiency remain unclear, but emerging data indicate that progranulin insufficiency may impair lysosomal sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes. We investigated the effects of progranulin insufficiency on sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in the inferior frontal gyrus of FTD-GRN patients using fluorogenic activity assays, biochemical profiling of enzyme levels and posttranslational modifications, and quantitative neuropathology. Of the enzymes studied, only β-glucocerebrosidase exhibited impairment in FTD-GRN patients. Brains from FTD-GRN patients had lower activity than controls, which was associated with lower levels of mature β-glucocerebrosidase protein and accumulation of insoluble, incompletely glycosylated β-glucocerebrosidase. Immunostaining revealed loss of neuronal β-glucocerebrosidase in FTD-GRN patients. To investigate the effects of progranulin insufficiency on β-glucocerebrosidase outside of the context of neurodegeneration, we investigated β-glucocerebrosidase activity in progranulin-insufficient mice. Brains from Grn -/- mice had lower β-glucocerebrosidase activity than wild-type littermates, which was corrected by AAV-progranulin gene therapy. These data show that progranulin insufficiency impairs β-glucocerebrosidase activity in the brain. This effect is strongest in neurons and may be caused by impaired β-glucocerebrosidase processing.",Frontotemporal dementia | Glycosphingolipid | Lysosome | Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis | Progranulin | β-Glucocerebrosidase,15,1,NIH,P30CA138313,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2019-12-01

However, the role of these cells and B lymphocytes in the human PvAT adjacent to unstable atherosclerotic plaques has not been investigated. Moreover, previous studies were inconclusive on whether PvAT inflammation was restricted to the surroundings of the atheroma plaque. Methods and Results Coronary arteries were freshly dissected with the surrounding PvAT. Atherosclerotic plaques were classified according to the internationally accepted anatomopathological criteria. Immune cells in the PvAT were detected using immunohistochemistry and then quantified. We used linear and logistic regressions with robust standard errors, adjusted for possible confounding factors. In 246 atherosclerotic plaques (205 stable and 41 unstable plaques) from 82 participants (mean age=69.0±14.4 years; 50% men), the percentage of arterial obstruction was positively correlated with the densities of CD68+ macrophages (P=0.003) and CD20+ B lymphocytes (P=0.03) in the periplaque PvAT. The number of cells was greater in the periplaque PvAT than in the distal PvAT (macrophages, P<0.001; B lymphocytes, P=0.04). In addition, the density of macrophages in the periplaque PvAT was greater in the presence of unstable plaques (P=0.03) and was also greater near unstable plaques than in the distal PvAT (P=0.001). CD3+ T lymphocytes were not associated with percentage of obstruction and stable/unstable plaque composition. Conclusions The density of CD20+ B lymphocytes and CD68+ macrophages in periplaque PvAT was increased with plaque size, and the CD68+ macrophages were greater near unstable atherosclerotic plaques than near stable lesions. This inflammation was more intense in the periplaque PvAT than in the PvAT distal to the atherosclerotic plaques.",atherosclerosis | B cell | coronary artery disease | inflammation | macrophages | pericoronary adipose tissue,9,1,NIA,K24 AG053435,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2019-12-01

However, we lack a systematic understanding of the cellular pathways controlling prion-like propagation of aggregation. To uncover such pathways, here we performed CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screens in a human cell-based model of propagation of tau aggregation monitored by FRET. Our screens uncovered that knockdown of several components of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, including charged multivesicular body protein 6 (CHMP6), or CHMP2A in combination with CHMP2B (whose gene is linked to familial FTD), promote propagation of tau aggregation. We found that knocking down the genes encoding these proteins also causes damage to endolysosomal membranes, consistent with a role for the ESCRT pathway in endolysosomal membrane repair. Leakiness of the endolysosomal compartment significantly enhanced prion-like propagation of tau aggregation, likely by making tau seeds more available to pools of cytoplasmic tau. Together, these findings suggest that endolysosomal escape is a critical step in tau propagation in neurodegenerative diseases.",,29,1,NIH,ALTF 1193–2015,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2019-12-01

We determined patient-specific “epicenters” at baseline, located each patient's epicenters in the healthy functional connectome, and derived two region-wise graph theoretical metrics to predict future atrophy: (1) shortest path length to the epicenter and (2) nodal hazard, the cumulative atrophy of a region's first-degree neighbors. Using these predictors and baseline atrophy, we could accurately predict longitudinal atrophy in most patients. The regions most vulnerable to subsequent atrophy were functionally connected to the epicenter and had intermediate levels of baseline atrophy.

Post-industrialized countries are particularly prone to an ever-increasing number of ageing individuals and ageing-associated neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with volume loss in the affected brain. MRI diagnoses and monitoring of subtle volume changes in the ageing/diseased brains have the potential to become standard diagnostic tools. Even with the superior resolution of 7 T MRI scanners, the microstructural changes comprising cell types, cell numbers, and cellular processes, are still undetectable. Knowledge of origin, nature, and progression for microstructural changes are necessary to understand pathogenetic stages in the relentless neurodegenerative diseases, as well as to develop therapeutic tools that delay or stop neurodegenerative processes at their earliest stage. We illustrate the gap in resolution by comparing the identical regions of the post-mortem in situ 7 T MR images (virtual autopsy or virtopsy) with the histological observations in serial sections through the same brain. We also described the protocols and limitations associated with these comparisons, as well as the necessity of supercomputers and data management for “Big data”. Analysis of neuron and/or glial number by using a body of mathematical tools and guidelines (stereology) is time-consuming, cumbersome, and still restricted to trained human investigators. Development of tools based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) could considerably accelerate studies on localization, onset, and progression of neuron loss. Finally, these observations could disentangle the mechanisms of volume loss into stages of reversible atrophy and/or irreversible fatal cell death. This AI- and ML-based cooperation between virtopsy and histology could bridge the present gap between virtual reality and neuropathology. It could also culminate in the creation of an imaging-associated comprehensive database.

Methods: We assessed the frequency of neuropathological lesions and their association with cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating scale ≥0.5) in the 80 or over age group compared to younger participants, using logistic regression models adjusted for sex, race and education. Results: Except for infarcts and siderocalcinosis, all neuropathological lesions were more common in the 80 or over age group (n = 412) compared to 50–79 year olds (n = 677). Very old participants had more than twice the likelihood of having ≥2 neuropathological diagnoses than younger participants (OR = 2.66, 95% CI = 2.03–3.50). Neurofibrillary tangles, infarcts and hyaline arteriolosclerosis were associated with cognitive impairment in the two age groups. Siderocalcinosis was associated with cognitive impairment in the younger participants only, while Lewy body disease was associated with cognitive impairment in the very old only. In addition, we found that the association of infarcts and multiple pathologies with cognitive impairment was attenuated in very old adults (Infarcts: P for interaction = 0.04; and multiple pathologies: P = 0.05). However, the predictive value for the aggregate model with all neuropathological lesions showed similar discrimination in both age groups [Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.778 in younger participants and AUROC = 0.765 in the very old]. Conclusion and relevance: Despite a higher frequency of neuropathological findings in the very old group, as found in studies with high-income populations, we found attenuation of the effect of infarcts rather than neurofibrillary tangles and plaques as reported previously.",80 and over | aged | Alzheimer’s disease | dementia | neuropathology | vascular dementia | very old,8,0,NIA,K24AG053435,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2019-11-01

Early and selective loss of von Economo neurons (VENs) and fork cells within the frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) is observed in patients with sporadic behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), including FTLD with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau). Recently, we further showed that these specialized neurons show preferential aggregation of TDP-43 in FTLD-TDP. Whether VENs and fork cells are prone to tau accumulation in FTLD-tau remains unclear, and no previous studies of these neurons have focused on patients with pathogenic variants in the gene encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (FTLD-tau/MAPT). Here, we examined regional profiles of tau aggregation and neurodegeneration in 40 brain regions in 8 patients with FTLD-tau/MAPT and 7 with Pick's disease (PiD), a sporadic form of FTLD-tau that often presents with bvFTD. We further qualitatively assessed the cellular patterns of frontoinsular tau aggregation in FTLD-tau/MAPT using antibodies specific for tau hyperphosphorylation, acetylation, or conformational change. ACC and mid-insula were among the regions most affected by neurodegeneration and tau aggregation in FTLD-tau/MAPT and PiD. In these two forms of FTLD-tau, severity of regional neurodegeneration and tau protein aggregation were highly correlated across regions. In FTLD-tau/MAPT, VENs and fork cells showed disproportionate tau protein aggregation in patients with V337 M, A152T, and IVS10 + 16 variants, but not in patients with the P301L variant. As seen in FTLD-TDP, our data suggest that VENs and fork cells represent preferentially vulnerable neuron types in most, but not all of the MAPT variants we studied.",Anterior cingulate cortex | Insula | MAPT | Selective vulnerability | Tau | von Economo neurons,9,1,NIH,AG023501,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2019-10-01

The impact of early tau pathology in wake-promoting neurons (WPNs) remains unclear. Methods: We performed stereology in postmortem brains from AD individuals and healthy controls to identify quantitative differences in morphological metrics in WPNs. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration were included as disease-specific controls. Results: The three nuclei studied accumulate considerable amounts of tau inclusions and showed a decrease in neurotransmitter-synthetizing neurons in AD, PSP, and corticobasal degeneration. However, substantial neuronal loss was exclusively found in AD. Discussion: WPNs are extremely vulnerable to AD but not to 4 repeat tauopathies. Considering that WPNs are involved early in AD, such degeneration should be included in the models explaining sleep-wake disturbances in AD and considered when designing a clinical intervention. Sparing of WPNs in PSP, a condition featuring hyperinsomnia, suggest that interventions to suppress the arousal system may benefit patients with PSP.",Alzheimer's disease | Autopsy | Corticobasal degeneration | Histamine | Human | Locus coeruleus | Orexin | Progressive supranuclear palsy | Sleep | Tauopathies | Unbiased stereology | Wake-promoting | Wakefulness,30,0,NIA,301035/2015-6,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2019-10-01

The previous studies have suggested differential neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) burden between amnestic and logopenic primary progressive aphasia presentations of AD. In this study, we explored the regional distribution of NFT pathology and its relationship to AD presentation across five different clinical syndromes. We assessed NFT density throughout six selected neocortical and hippocampal regions using thioflavin-S fluorescent microscopy in a well-characterized clinicopathological cohort of pure AD cases enriched for atypical clinical presentations. Subjects underwent apolipoprotein E genotyping and neuropsychological testing. Main cognitive domains (executive, visuospatial, language, and memory function) were assessed using an established composite z score. Our results showed that NFT regional burden aligns with the clinical presentation and region-specific cognitive scores. Cortical, but not hippocampal, NFT burden was higher among atypical clinical variants relative to the amnestic syndrome. In analyses of specific clinical variants, logopenic primary progressive aphasia showed higher NFT density in the superior temporal gyrus (p = 0.0091), and corticobasal syndrome showed higher NFT density in the primary motor cortex (p = 0.0205) relative to the amnestic syndrome. Higher NFT burden in the angular gyrus and CA1 sector of the hippocampus were independently associated with worsening visuospatial dysfunction. In addition, unbiased hierarchical clustering based on regional NFT densities identified three groups characterized by a low overall NFT burden, high overall burden, and cortical-predominant burden, respectively, which were found to differ in sex ratio, age, disease duration, and clinical presentation. In comparison, the typical, hippocampal sparing, and limbic-predominant subtypes derived from a previously proposed algorithm did not reproduce the same degree of clinical relevance in this sample.

Novel MRI approaches now provide an opportunity to quantify structural features of the locus coeruleus in vivo during disease progression. In combination with neuropathological biomarkers, in vivo locus coeruleus imaging could help to understand the contribution of locus coeruleus neurodegeneration to clinical and pathological manifestations in Alzheimer’s disease, atypical neurodegenerative dementias and Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, as the functional sensitivity of the noradrenergic system is likely to change with disease progression, in vivo measures of locus coeruleus integrity could provide new pathophysiological insights into cognitive and behavioural symptoms. Locus coeruleus imaging also holds the promise to stratify patients into clinical trials according to noradrenergic dysfunction. In this article, we present a consensus on how non-invasive in vivo assessment of locus coeruleus integrity can be used for clinical research in neurodegenerative diseases.

According to the most conventional sleep model, wake-promoting neurons (WPNs) and sleep-promoting neurons (SPNs) compete for network dominance, creating a systematic “switch” that results in either the sleep or awake state. WPNs and SPNs are ubiquitous in the brainstem and diencephalon, areas that together contain <1% of the neurons in the human brain. Interestingly, many of these WPNs and SPNs co-express and co-release various types of the neurotransmitters that often have opposing modulatory effects on the network. Co-transmission is often beneficial to structures with limited numbers of neurons because it provides increasing computational capability and flexibility. Moreover, co-transmission allows subcortical structures to bi-directionally control postsynaptic neurons, thus helping to orchestrate several complex physiological functions such as sleep. Here, we present an in-depth review of co-transmission in hypothalamic WPNs and SPNs and discuss its functional significance in the sleep–wake network.",,4,0,NIMH,R56MH107042,National Institute of Mental Health,papers by authors,1,2019-09-01

These interactions are sensitive to proteolysis, which alters the ensemble of cellular N and C termini. Here we describe a mechanism wherein caspase activity reveals latent C termini that are then recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. Using expanded knowledge of CHIP’s binding specificity, we predicted hundreds of putative interactions arising from caspase activity. Subsequent validation experiments confirmed that CHIP binds the latent C termini at tauD421 and caspase-6D179. CHIP binding to tauD421, but not tauFL, promoted its ubiquitination, while binding to caspase-6D179 mediated ubiquitin-independent inhibition. Given that caspase activity generates tauD421 in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), these results suggested a concise model for CHIP regulation of tau homeostasis. Indeed, we find that loss of CHIP expression in AD coincides with the accumulation of tauD421 and caspase-6D179.

Co-occurrence of neurological and psychiatric symptoms are observed among mental disorders, representing a challenge for their differential diagnosis. Psychiatrists and neurologists have faced challenges in diagnosing old adults presenting behavioral changes. This is the case for early frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and bipolar disorder. In its initial stages, FTD is characterized by behavioral or language disturbances in the absence of cognitive symptoms. Consequently, patients with the behavioral subtype of FTD (bv-FTD) can be initially misdiagnosed as having a psychiatric disorder, typically major depression disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). Bipolar disorder is associated with a higher risk of dementia in older adults and with cognitive impairment, with a subset of patients presents a neuroprogressive pattern during the disease course. No mendelian mutations were identified in BD, whereas three major genetic causes of FTD have been identified. Clinical similarities between BD and bv-FTD raise the question whether common molecular pathways might explain shared clinical symptoms. Here, we reviewed existing data on clinical and molecular similarities between BD and FTD to propose biological pathways that can be further investigated as common or specific markers of BD and FTD.",Biomarkers | Bipolar disorder | Frontotemporal dementia | Neurodegeneration | Neuropsychiatric symptoms,11,0,NIA,K24AG053435,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2019-07-01

Structural and functional MRI measures can assess the integrity of these networks and have been proposed as biomarkers of disease progression for clinical trials. The relationship between in vivo imaging measures and pathological features, at the single subject level, remains largely unknown. Patient-specific maps of atrophy and seed-based intrinsic connectivity disruption, as compared to normal controls, were obtained for 27 patients subsequently diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 16, seven males, age at death 68.9 ± 6.0 years, imaging-to-pathology interval = 670.2 ± 425.1 days) or corticobasal degeneration (n = 11, two males, age at death 66.7 ± 5.4 years, imaging-to-pathology interval = 696.2 ± 482.2 days). A linear mixed effect model with crossed random effects was used to test regional and single-subject level associations between post-mortem regional measures of neurodegeneration and tau inclusion burden, on the one hand, and regional volume loss and seed-based intrinsic connectivity reduction, on the other. A significant association was found between tau inclusion burden and in vivo volume loss, at the regional level and independent of neurodegeneration severity, in both progressive supranuclear palsy [n = 340 regions; beta 0.036; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.001, 0.072; P = 0.046] and corticobasal degeneration (n = 215 regions; beta 0.044; 95% CI: 0.009, 0.079; P = 0.013). We also found a significant association between post-mortem neurodegeneration and in vivo volume loss in both progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 340 regions; beta 0.155; 95% CI: 0.061, 0.248; P = 0.001) and corticobasal degeneration (n = 215 regions; beta 0.277; 95% CI: 0.104, 0.450; P = 0.002).

Our data suggest that in vivo structural imaging measures reflect independent contributions from neurodegeneration and tau burden in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Seed-based measures of intrinsic connectivity dysfunction showed less reliable predictive value when used as in vivo biomarkers of tauopathy.

We evaluated the prevalence of primary progressive aphasia in a series of pathologically confirmed cases of FTD-MND spectrum. Methods: Pathologically confirmed cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration-motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND) were obtained from the UCSF brain bank. Cases were analyzed for presence of language impairment via retrospective chart review of research visits that include neurologic exam, in-depth cognitive testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging. Forty one cases were included. Thirty two were diagnosed with FTD-MND, while nine cases were diagnosed as MND-only from clinical evaluation. Results: Ten FTLD-MND cases (31%) presented with prominent or isolated language involvement consistent with a diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), which we called progressive aphasia with motor neuron disease (PA-MND). Of these, three cases that mirrored the non-fluent variant of PPA (nfvPPA) were named nfvPA-MND. The imaging pattern of these nfvPA-MND showed atrophy strictly confined to the frontal and anterior temporal language cortical areas. Another group of seven cases that resembled patients with the semantic variant PPA (svPPA) were named svPA-MND. The group of svPPA-MND on imaging analysis showed selective atrophy of the temporal lobe and orbitofrontal cortex. Conclusions: Language impairment was a frequent phenotype of FTD-MND associated with focal atrophy patterns within the language networks. This data suggest patients with FTD-MND can present quite often with language phenotype of nfvPPA and svPPA, as opposed to exclusive bvFTD symptoms.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | dementia | frontotemporal dementia | imaging | motor neuron disease | Neuropathology | primary progressive aphasia,11,0,NIH,P0519279,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2019-04-01

Methods: We used unbiased stereological tools to estimate the degree of cortical pathology in serial gallocyanin-stained brain sections through the complete hemispheres of three subjects with genetically verified ChAc and a range of disease durations. We compared these results with our previous data of five Huntington's disease (HD) and five control cases. Pathoarchitectonic changes were exemplarily documented in TE1 of a 61-year-old female HD-, a 60-year-old female control case, and ChAc3. Results: Macroscopically, the cortical volume of our ChAc cases (ChAc1–3) remained close to normal. However, the average number of neurones was reduced by 46% in ChAc and by 33% in HD (P = 0.03 for ChAc & HD vs. controls; P = 0.64 for ChAc vs. HD). Terminal HD cases featured selective laminar neurone loss with pallor of layers III, V and VIa, a high density of small, pale, closely packed radial fibres in deep cortical layers VI and V, shrinkage, and chromophilia of subcortical white matter. In ChAc, pronounced diffuse astrogliosis blurred the laminar borders, thus masking the complete and partial loss of pyramidal cells in layer IIIc and of neurones in layers III, V and VI. Conclusion: ChAc is a neurodegenerative disease with distinct cortical neurodegeneration. The hypertrophy of the peripheral neuropil space of minicolumns with coarse vertical striation was characteristic of ChAc. The role of astroglia in the pathogenesis of this disorder remains to be elucidated.",minicolumn | neurodegenerative disease | neurone number | selective vulnerability | stereology,7,0,NIA,1098,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2019-04-01

In our studies, we inoculated MSA and control patient samples into Tg mice constructed using a P1 artificial chromosome to express wild-type (WT), A30P, and A53T human α-synuclein on a mouse α-synuclein knockout background [Tg(SNCA +/+ )Nbm, Tg(SNCA*A30P +/+ )Nbm, and Tg(SNCA*A53T +/+ )Nbm]. In contrast to studies using TgM83 +/− mice, motor deficits were not observed by 330–400 days in any of the Tg(SNCA)Nbm mice after inoculation with MSA brain homogenates. However, using a cell-based bioassay to measure α-synuclein prions, we found brain homogenates from Tg(SNCA*A53T +/+ )Nbm mice inoculated with MSA patient samples contained α-synuclein prions, whereas control mice did not. Moreover, these α-synuclein aggregates retained the biological and biochemical characteristics of the α-synuclein prions in MSA patient samples. Intriguingly, Tg(SNCA*A53T +/+ )Nbm mice developed α-synuclein pathology in neurons and astrocytes throughout the limbic system. This finding is in contrast to MSA-inoculated TgM83 +/− mice, which develop exclusively neuronal α-synuclein aggregates in the hindbrain that cause motor deficits with advanced disease. In a crossover experiment, we inoculated TgM83 +/− mice with brain homogenate from two MSA patient samples or one control sample first inoculated, or passaged, in Tg(SNCA*A53T +/+ )Nbm animals. Additionally, we performed the reverse experiment by inoculating Tg(SNCA*A53T +/+ )Nbm mice with brain homogenate from the same two MSA samples and one control sample first passaged in TgM83 +/− animals. The TgM83 +/− mice inoculated with mouse-passaged MSA developed motor dysfunction and α-synuclein prions, whereas the mouse-passaged control sample had no effect. Similarly, the mouse-passaged MSA samples induced α-synuclein prion formation in Tg(SNCA*A53T +/+ )Nbm mice, but the mouse-passaged control sample did not. The confirmed transmission of α-synuclein prions to a second synucleinopathy model and the ability to propagate prions between two distinct mouse lines while retaining strain-specific properties provides compelling evidence that MSA is a prion disease.",Neurodegeneration | Proteinopathies | Transmission models | α-Synuclein,33,0,NIH,AG005134,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2019-03-01

Similar depositions have been reported within the olfactory epithelium (OE), a tissue that can be biopsied in vivo. The degree to which such biopsies are useful in identifying AD is controversial. This postmortem study had 3 main goals: first, to quantify the relative densities of AD-related proteins in 3 regions of the olfactory neuroepithelium, namely, the nasal septum, middle turbinate, and superior turbinate; second, to establish whether such densities are correlated among these epithelial regions as well as with semi-quantitative ratings of general brain cortex pathology; and third, to evaluate correlations between the protein densities and measures of antemortem cognitive function. Methods: Postmortem blocks of olfactory mucosa were obtained from 12 AD cadavers and 24 controls and subjected to amyloid-beta and PHF-tau immunohistochemistry. Results: We observed marked heterogeneity in the presence of the biomarkers of tau and amyloid-beta among the targeted olfactory epithelial regions. No significant difference was observed between the cadavers with AD and the controls regarding the concentration of these proteins in any of these epithelial regions. Only one correlation significant was evident, namely, that between the tau protein densities of the middle and the upper turbinate (r =.58, P =.002). Conclusion: AD-related biomarker heterogeneity, which has not been previously demonstrated, makes comparisons across studies difficult and throws into question the usefulness of OE amyloid-beta and PHF-tau biopsies in detecting AD.",aging | Alzheimer’s disease | immunohistochemistry | olfaction | olfaction disorders | olfactory mucosa,3,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2019-03-01

The effects of these proteins in the brain are complex, and each can present with several different clinical syndromes. Clinical efficacy trials of drugs targeting these proteins must use endpoints that are meaningful to all participants despite the variability in symptoms across patients. There are many candidate clinical measures, including neuropsychological scores and functional measures. Brain imaging is another potentially attractive outcome that can be precisely quantified and provides evidence of disease modification. Most imaging studies in frontotemporal dementia have been cross-sectional, and few have compared longitudinal changes in cortical volume with changes in other measures such as perfusion and white matter integrity. The current study characterized longitudinal changes in 161 patients with three frontotemporal dementia syndromes: behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 77) and the semantic (n = 45) and non-fluent (n = 39) variants of primary progressive aphasia. Visits included comprehensive neuropsychological and functional assessment, structural MRI (3 T), diffusion tensor imaging, and arterial spin labelled perfusion imaging. The goal was to identify measures that are appropriate as clinical trial outcomes for each group, as well as those that might be appropriate for trials that would include more than one of these groups. Linear mixed effects models were used to estimate changes in each measure, and to examine the correlation between imaging and clinical changes. Sample sizes were estimated based on the observed effects for theoretical clinical trials using bootstrapping techniques to provide 95% confidence intervals for these estimates. Declines in functional and neuropsychological measures, as well as frontal and temporal cortical volumes and white matter microstructure were detected in all groups. Imaging changes were statistically significantly correlated with, and explained a substantial portion of variance in, the change in most clinical measures. Perfusion and diffusion tensor imaging accounted for variation in clinical decline beyond volume alone. Sample size estimates for atrophy and diffusion imaging were comparable to clinical measures. Corpus callosal fractional anisotropy led to the lowest sample size estimates for all three syndromes. These findings provide further guidance on selection of trial endpoints for studies in frontotemporal dementia and support the use of neuroimaging, particularly structural and diffusion weighted imaging, as biomarkers. Diffusion and perfusion imaging appear to offer additional utility for explaining clinical change beyond the variance explained by volume alone, arguing for considering multimodal imaging in treatment trials.",biomarkers | brain atrophy and diffusion imaging | cognition | memory and executive function | primary progressive aphasia,29,1,NIH,AG032306,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2019-02-01

Methods: We performed 18F-flortaucipir imaging in patients with the FTD syndromes (n = 45): nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) (n = 11), corticobasal syndrome (CBS) (n = 10), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) (n = 10), semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA) (n = 2) and FTD associated pathogenic genetic mutations microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) (n = 6), chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) (n = 5), and progranulin (GRN) (n = 1). All patients underwent MRI and β-amyloid biomarker testing via 11C-PiB or cerebrospinal fluid. 18F-flortaucipir uptake in patients was compared to 53 β-amyloid negative normal controls using voxelwise and pre-specified region of interest approaches. Results: On qualitative assessment, patients with nfvPPA showed elevated 18F-flortacupir binding in the left greater than right inferior frontal gyrus. Patients with CBS showed elevated binding in frontal white matter, with higher cortical gray matter uptake in a subset of β-amyloid-positive patients. Five of ten patients with sporadic bvFTD demonstrated increased frontotemporal binding. MAPT mutation carriers had elevated 18F-flortaucipir retention primarily, but not exclusively, in mutations with Alzheimer's-like neurofibrillary tangles. However, tracer retention was also seen in patients with svPPA, and the mutations C9ORF72, GRN predicted to have TDP-43 pathology. Quantitative region-of-interest differences between patients and controls were seen only in inferior frontal gyrus in nfvPPA and left insula and bilateral temporal poles in MAPT carriers. No significant regional differences were found in CBS or sporadic bvFTD. Two patients underwent postmortem neuropathological examination. A patient with C9ORF72, TDP-43-type B pathology, and incidental co-pathology of scattered neurofibrillary tangles in the middle frontal, inferior temporal gyrus showed corresponding mild 18F-flortaucipir retention without additional uptake matching the widespread TDP-43 type B pathology. A patient with sporadic bvFTD demonstrated punctate inferior temporal and hippocampus tracer retention, corresponding to the area of severe argyrophilic grain disease pathology. Conclusions: 18F-flortaucipir in patients with FTD and predicted tauopathy or TDP-43 pathology demonstrated limited sensitivity and specificity.

The earliest stages of TDP-43 pathobiology are not well-characterized, and whether neurodegeneration results from TDP-43 loss-of-function or aggregation remains unclear. In the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD), patients undergo selective dropout of von Economo neurons (VENs) and fork cells within the frontoinsular (FI) and anterior cingulate cortices. Here, we examined TDP-43 pathobiology within these vulnerable neurons in the FI across a clinical spectrum including 17 patients with sporadic bvFTD, MND, or both. In an exploratory analysis based on our initial observations, we further assessed ten patients with C9orf72-associated bvFTD/MND. VENs and fork cells showed early, disproportionate TDP-43 aggregation that correlated with anatomical and clinical severity, including loss of emotional empathy. The presence of a TDP-43 inclusion was associated with striking nuclear and somatodendritic atrophy. An intriguing minority of neurons lacked detectable nuclear TDP-43 despite the apparent absence of a cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusion. These cells showed neuronal atrophy comparable to inclusion-bearing neurons, suggesting that the loss of nuclear TDP-43 function promotes neurodegeneration, even when TDP-43 aggregation is inconspicuous or absent.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) | C9orf72 | Empathy | Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) | TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) | Von Economo neuron (VEN),27,0,NIH,P01AG019724,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2019-01-01

We conducted a case–control genetic association study comparing pathologically diagnosed FTLD patients (n = 94) to cognitively normal older adults (n = 3541), and found suggestive evidence that gene-wide aggregate rare variant burden in MFSD8 is associated with FTLD risk. Because homozygous mutations in MFSD8 cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), similar to homozygous mutations in GRN, we assessed rare variants in MFSD8 for relevance to FTLD through experimental follow-up studies. Using post-mortem tissue from middle frontal gyrus of patients with FTLD and controls, we identified increased MFSD8 protein levels in MFSD8 rare variant carriers relative to non-variant carrier patients with sporadic FTLD and healthy controls. We also observed an increase in lysosomal and autophagy-related proteins in MFSD8 rare variant carrier and sporadic FTLD patients relative to controls. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that MFSD8 was expressed in neurons and astrocytes across subjects, without clear evidence of abnormal localization in patients. Finally, in vitro studies identified marked disruption of lysosomal function in cells from MFSD8 rare variant carriers, and identified one rare variant that significantly increased the cell surface levels of MFSD8. Considering the growing evidence for altered autophagy in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, our findings support a role of NCL genes in FTLD risk and suggest that MFSD8-associated lysosomal dysfunction may contribute to FTLD pathology.",Autophagy | Frontotemporal dementia | Genetics | Lysosomes | Neurodegeneration | Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,9,0,NIH,AG048030,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2019-01-01

We found statistically significant layer- and region-specific lower neuron densities in our OCD cases that added to a deficit of 25% in AM and AL and to a deficit of 21% in MO, respectively. The volumes of the OFC areas were similar between the OCD and control groups.

Moreover, all studies so far used imaging studies to evaluate visceral fat and this association has not been described yet using autopsy material, which allows the direct quantification of abdominal fat. We aimed to investigate the association between direct measurements of abdominal visceral fat and cognitive impairment in an autopsy study. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we collected information on sociodemographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and cognitive status from subjects aged 50 or older at time of death in a general autopsy service in Brazil. Abdominal visceral fat was obtained in natura by the dissection of perirenal, mesenteric, omental, and mesocolon fat. The associations of total abdominal visceral fat with cognitive impairment [clinical dementia rating (CDR) score ≥0.5] and CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) were evaluated using logistic regression and negative binomial regression models, respectively. All analyses were adjusted for height, age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, stroke, smoking, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. In addition, we compared the discrimination of visceral fat, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) measurements in predicting cognitive impairment. Results: We evaluated 234 participants (mean age = 71.2 ± 12.9 years old, 59% male). Abdominal visceral fat was inversely associated with cognitive impairment (OR = 0.46, CI = 0.30; 0.70, p < 0.0001) and with CDR-SB scores (β = −0.85, 95% CI = −1.28; −0.43, p < 0.0001). When we compared the area under the ROC curve (AUC), visceral fat (AUC = 0.754), BMI (AUC = 0.729), and WC (AUC = 0.720) showed similar discrimination in predicting cognitive impairment (p = 0.38). Conclusion: In an autopsy study, larger amount of directly measured abdominal visceral fat was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in older adults.",Abdominal fat | Aging | Autopsy | Dementia | Obesity,2,1,FAPESP,undefined,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,papers by authors,4,2019-01-01

Objective: To compare the prevalence of BPSD according to cognitive status, and to determine NPI cutoffs that best discern individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia from those without dementia. Methods: We included 1,565 participants (mean age=72.7±12.2 years, 48% male). BPSD and cognitive status were assessed with the NPI and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). We used multivariable logistic regression models to investigate the association of BPSD with cognitive status. The area under the curve (AUC) was used to assess model discrimination, and to determine the best NPI cutoff for MCI and dementia. Results: Participants were cognitively normal (CDR=0; n=1,062), MCI (CDR=0.5; n=145), or dementia (CDR≥1.0, n=358). NPI symptoms were more frequent in dementia and MCI when compared to cognitively normal. Higher odds for delusions, hallucinations, disinhibition, and psychomotor alterations were found among participants with dementia and MCI than in those who were cognitively normal. The best NPI cutoff to discern participants with dementia from those cognitively normal was 11 (AUC=0.755). Poor discrimination (AUC=0.563) was found for the comparison of MCI and those cognitively normal. Conclusions: We found an increase in BPSD frequencies across the continuum of cognitive impairment.

However, it is still not clear how these affect mtDNA stability, as reported levels of mtDNA mutations in AD are conflicting. Thus, we investigated whether alterations in BER correlate with mtDNA instability in AD using postmortem brain samples from cognitively normal AD subjects and individuals who show neuropathological features of AD, but remained cognitively normal (high-pathology control). To date, no data on DNA repair and mtDNA stability are available for these individuals. BER activities, mtDNA mutations, and mtDNA copy number were measured in the nuclear and mitochondrial extracts. Significantly lower uracil DNA glycosylase activity was detected in nuclear and mitochondrial extracts from AD subjects, while apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease activity was similar in all groups. Although mtDNA mutation frequency was similar in all groups, mtDNA copy number was significantly decreased in the temporal cortex of AD brains but not of high-pathology control subjects. Our results show that lower mitochondrial uracil DNA glycosylase activity does not result in increased mutagenesis, but rather in depletion of mtDNA in early-affected brain regions during AD development.",Alzheimer's disease | Base excision repair | mtDNA depletion | mtDNA mutation,10,0,FAPESP,"08/57,721-3",Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,papers by authors,6,2019-01-01

Methods: We selected subjects with mixed FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau from 247 FTLD cases from the University of California, San Francisco, Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank collected between 2000 and 2016 and compared their clinical, anatomical, genetic, imaging and pathological signatures with those of subjects with pure FTLD. Results: We found nine cases (3.6%) with prominent FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau. Six cases were sporadic, whereas one case had a C9ORF72 expansion, another had a TARDBP A90V variant, and the other had an MAPT p.A152T variant. The subtypes of FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau varied. Mixed FTLD cases were older and tended to show a higher burden of Alzheimer disease pathology (3/9, 33%). The neuroimaging signature of mixed cases, in general, included more widespread atrophy than that of pure groups. Specifically, cases of mixed corticobasal degeneration (CBD) with FTLD-TDP showed more prominent asymmetric left-sided atrophy than did those of pure CBD. However, the clinical phenotype of mixed cases was similar to that seen in pure FTLD. Conclusions: Although patients with mixed FTLD-TDP and FTLD-tau are rare, in-depth clinical, pathological and genetic investigations may shed light on the genetic and biochemical pathways that cause the accumulation of multiple proteinaceous inclusions and inform therapeutic targets that may be beneficial to each one of these abnormal protein misfoldings.",Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | TAR-DNA binding protein-43 | Tau,8,0,NIH,K24AG053435,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2018-12-01

However, there are no studies measuring BDNF levels directly in post-mortem brains of older subjects with MDD and dementia. We aimed to verify if brain BDNF levels were lower in older adults with lifetime history of MDD with and without dementia. Methods: BDNF levels of post-mortem brains from 80 community-dwelling older individuals with lifetime MDD with and without dementia were compared with levels from 80 controls without lifetime MDD. Participants with no reliable close informant, or with prolonged agonal state were excluded. Lifetime MDD was defined as at least one previous episode according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID). Results: BDNF levels were lower in the MDD group with dementia than in participants with dementia and without MDD as confirmed by multivariate analysis adjusted for clinical and cardiovascular risk factors (ß = −0.106, 95%CI = −0.204; −0.009, p = 0.034). No difference was found in the group with MDD without dementia compared with their controls. Limitations: The retrospective assessment of a lifetime history of depression may be subject to information bias and this study only establishes a cross-sectional association between lifetime history of MDD and lower levels of BDNF in patients with dementia. Conclusions: In this community sample of older individuals, lower brain BDNF levels were found in cases with both lifetime MDD and dementia.

The underlying cognitive reserve mechanisms were underexplored in low-educated individuals. Because episodic memory impairment due to hippocampal dysfunction is a key feature of Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), we sought to look at a possible cognitive reserve mechanism by determining whether few years of education moderated the relationship between the hippocampal volumes and the episodic-memory scores. The sample was composed by 183 older adults, 40.1% male, with the median age of 78[76,82] years and the median years of education of 4[2,10] who had undergone an episodic-memory test and a 3-Tesla MRI scan to access the hippocampal volumes. Overall, 112 were cognitively healthy, 26 had cognitive impairment-no dementia (CIND) and 45 had dementia. We used multiple linear regression to assess whether the interaction between years of education and each hippocampal volume significantly predicted the episodic-memory scores’ variance, controlling for cognitive diagnosis and nuisance variables. The interaction term with the left hippocampus (ß = 0.2, p = 0.043, CI = 1.0, 1.4), but not with the right (ß = 0.1, p = 0.218, CI = 0.9, 1.2) significantly predicted the variation on memory scores. The mechanism by which the left hippocampus seems to play a more important role on memory processing in more educated individuals needs to be further investigated and might be associated with a better use of mnemonic strategies or higher hippocampal connectivity. Because the sample’s median years of education was four, which corresponds to primary school, we may infer that this level might be sufficient to contribute for building cognitive reserve.",aging | cognitive reserve | education | episodic memory | hippocampus | neuroimaging,12,1,CNPq,N?s 17/2006,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,papers by authors,0,2018-11-01

Linear mixed effect models were used to assess the value of baseline biomarkers in predicting clinical and radiographic change in patient cohorts over multiple yearly follow up visits. Results: Neurofilament light chain concentrations were lowest in controls. Elevated baseline neurofilament light chain predicted faster worsening in clinical severity, frontotemporal volume and frontotemporal fractional anisotropy in patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia. High total tau similarly predicted faster progression in nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia. In behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, higher phosphorylated tau181 predicted faster clinical progression whereas lower amyloid beta1-42 predicted faster volumetric and fractional anisotropy reduction. Neurofilament light chain and phosphorylated tau181 were of greater predictive value in patients with tau pathology as compared to TDP-43 pathology. Baseline neurofilament light chain correlated with baseline clinical severity and frontotemporal volume in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia.

This study hypothesized that patients with focal neurodegenerative syndromes outside the language network, such as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), would have a higher rate of nonlanguage LDs, congruent with their mainly visuospatial presentation. OBJECTIVE To investigate the prevalence and type of LD (language and/or mathematical and visuospatial) in a large cohort of patients with PCA compared with patients with logopenic variant PPA (lvPPA) and amnestic Alzheimer disease (AD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This case-control study reviewed 279 medical records from a university-based clinic and research center for patients with neurodegenerative diseases for LD history, including patients with PCA (n = 95), patients with lvPPA (n = 84), and a matched cohort with amnestic AD (n = 100). No records were excluded. The study compared cognitive and neuroimaging features of patients with PCA with and without LDs. A review of the records of patients presenting from March 1, 1999, to August 31, 2014, revealed 95 PCA cases and 84 lvPPA cases. Then 100 patients with amnestic AD from this same period were chosen for comparison, matching against the groups for age, sex, and disease severity. Data analysis was performed from September 8, 2013, to November 6, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prevalence of total LD history and prevalence of language and mathematical or visuospatial LD history across all cohorts. RESULTS A total of 179 atypical AD cases (95 with PCA and 84 with lvPPA) and 100 disease control cases (amnestic AD)were included in the study. The groupswere not statistically different for mean (SD) age at first visit (PCA, 61.9 [7.0] years; lvPPA, 65.1 [8.7] years; amnestic AD, 64.0 [12.6] years; P = .08), mean (SD) age at first symptom (PCA, 57.5 [7.0] years; lvPPA, 61.1 [9.0] years; amnestic AD, 59.6 [13.7] years; P = .06), or sex (PCA, 66.3%female; lvPPA, 56.0%female; amnestic AD, 57.0%female; P = .30) but differed on non-right-hand preference (PCA, 18.3%; lvPPA, 20.2%; amnestic AD, 7.7%; P = .04), race/ethnicity (PCA, 88.3%white; lvPPA, 99.0%white; amnestic AD, 80.0%white; P < .001), and mean (SD) educational level (PCA, 15.7 [3.2] years; lvPPA, 16.2 [3.3] years; amnestic AD, 14.8 [3.5] years; P = .02). A total of 18 of the 95 patients with PCA (18.9%) reported a history of LD, which is greater than the 3 of 100 patients (3.0%) in the amnestic AD cohort (P < .001) and the 10.0%expected rate in the general population (P = .007). In the PCA cohort, 13 of 95 patients (13.7%) had a nonlanguage mathematical and/or visuospatial LD; this ratewas greater than that in the amnestic AD (1 of 100 [1.0%]; P < .001) and lvPPA (2 of 84 [2.4%]; P = .006) cohorts and greater than the 6.0% expected general population rate of mathematical LD (P = .003). Compared with the patients with PCA without LDs, the group with LDs had greater preservation of global cognition and a more right-lateralized pattern of atrophy.

Patients with GRN mutations present with a uniform subtype of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology at autopsy (FTLD-TDP type A); however, age at onset and clinical presentation are variable, even within families. We aimed to identify potential genetic modifiers of disease onset and disease risk in GRN mutation carriers. Methods: The study was done in three stages: a discovery stage, a replication stage, and a meta-analysis of the discovery and replication data. In the discovery stage, genome-wide logistic and linear regression analyses were done to test the association of genetic variants with disease risk (case or control status) and age at onset in patients with a GRN mutation and controls free of neurodegenerative disorders. Suggestive loci (p<1 × 10 −5 ) were genotyped in a replication cohort of patients and controls, followed by a meta-analysis. The effect of genome-wide significant variants at the GFRA2 locus on expression of GFRA2 was assessed using mRNA expression studies in cerebellar tissue samples from the Mayo Clinic brain bank. The effect of the GFRA2 locus on progranulin concentrations was studied using previously generated ELISA-based expression data. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells were done to test for a direct interaction between GFRA2 and progranulin. Findings: Individuals were enrolled in the current study between Sept 16, 2014, and Oct 5, 2017. After quality control measures, statistical analyses in the discovery stage included 382 unrelated symptomatic GRN mutation carriers and 1146 controls free of neurodegenerative disorders collected from 34 research centres located in the USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. In the replication stage, 210 patients (67 symptomatic GRN mutation carriers and 143 patients with FTLD without GRN mutations pathologically confirmed as FTLD-TDP type A) and 1798 controls free of neurodegenerative diseases were recruited from 26 sites, 20 of which overlapped with the discovery stage. No genome-wide significant association with age at onset was identified in the discovery or replication stages, or in the meta-analysis. However, in the case-control analysis, we replicated the previously reported TMEM106B association (rs1990622 meta-analysis odds ratio [OR] 0·54, 95% CI 0·46–0·63; p=3·54 × 10 −16 ), and identified a novel genome-wide significant locus at GFRA2 on chromosome 8p21.3 associated with disease risk (rs36196656 meta-analysis OR 1·49, 95% CI 1·30–1·71; p=1·58 × 10 −8 ). Expression analyses showed that the risk-associated allele at rs36196656 decreased GFRA2 mRNA concentrations in cerebellar tissue (p=0·04). No effect of rs36196656 on plasma and CSF progranulin concentrations was detected by ELISA; however, co-immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293T cells did suggest a direct binding of progranulin and GFRA2. Interpretation: TMEM106B-related and GFRA2-related pathways might be future targets for treatments for FTLD, but the biological interaction between progranulin and these potential disease modifiers requires further study. TMEM106B and GFRA2 might also provide opportunities to select and stratify patients for future clinical trials and, when more is known about their potential effects, to inform genetic counselling, especially for asymptomatic individuals.

Methods: In order to compare these neuropathologies, serial gallocyanin-stained brain sections from three subjects with ChAc were analyzed and compared with our previous studies of eight HD cases, in addition to three hemispheres from two male controls. Results: Astrogliosis was much greater in the ChAc striatum, as compared to that found in HD, with dramatic increase in total striatal glia numbers and the number of glia per striatal neuron. Striatal astrocytes are most likely derived from the striatal subependymal layer in ChAc, which showed massive proliferation. The thalamic centromedian-parafascicular complex is reciprocally connected to the striatum and is more heavily affected in HD than in ChAc. Conclusion: The distinct patterns of selective vulnerability and gliosis observed in HD and ChAc challenge simplistic views on the pathogenesis of these two diseases with rather similar clinical signs. The particular roles played by astroglia in ChAc and in HD clearly need to be elucidated in more detail.",Chorea-acanthocytosis | Huntington's disease | Stereology | Subcortical neurodegenerationin,7,0,NSFC,16JL28,Advocacy for Neuroacanthocytosis Patients,papers by authors,0,2018-04-01

Even with the recent advances in MRI technology, histological examination renders different (and complementary) information of the nervous tissue. Although several maps have been selected as a basis for correlating imaging results with the anatomical locations of sub-cortical structures, technical limitations interfere in a point-to-point correlation between imaging and anatomy due to the lack of precise correction for post-mortem tissue deformations caused by tissue fixation and processing. We present an alternative method to parcellate human brain cytoarchitectural regions, minimizing deformations caused by post-mortem and tissue-processing artifacts and enhancing segmentation by means of modified high thickness histological techniques and registration with MRI of the same specimen and into MNI space (ICBM152). A three-dimensional (3D) histological atlas of the human thalamus, basal ganglia, and basal forebrain cholinergic system is displayed. Structure’s segmentations were performed in high-resolution dark-field and light-field microscopy. Bidimensional non-linear registration of the histological slices was followed by 3D registration with in situ MRI of the same subject. Manual and automated registration procedures were adopted and compared. To evaluate the quality of the registration procedures, Dice similarity coefficient and normalized weighted spectral distance were calculated and the results indicate good overlap between registered volumes and a small shape difference between them in both manual and automated registration methods. High thickness high-resolution histological slices in combination with registration to in situ MRI of the same subject provide an effective alternative method to study nuclear boundaries in the human brain, enhancing segmentation and demanding less resources and time for tissue processing than traditional methods.",Cytoarchitecture | Magnetic resonance imaging | Sub-cortical atlas | Thalamus,15,0,NIA,R01AG040311,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2018-04-01

Methods: We systematically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis on the prevalence of TDP-43 proteinopathy in older adults with normal cognition, evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination or the Clinical Dementia Rating. We estimated the overall prevalence of TDP-43 using random-effect models, and stratified by age, sex, sample size, study quality, antibody used to assess TDP-43 aggregates, analysed brain regions, Braak stage, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score, hippocampal sclerosis and geographic location. Results: A total of 505 articles were identified in the systematic review, and 7 were included in the meta-analysis with 1196 cognitively normal older adults. We found an overall prevalence of TDP-43 proteinopathy of 24%. Prevalence of TDP-43 proteinopathy varied widely across geographic location (North America: 37%, Asia: 29%, Europe: 14%, and Latin America: 11%). Estimated prevalence of TDP-43 proteinopathy also varied according to study quality (quality score >7: 22% vs. quality score <7: 42%), antibody used to assess TDP-43 proteinopathy (native: 18% vs. hyperphosphorylated: 24%) and presence of hippocampal sclerosis (without 24% vs. with hippocampal sclerosis: 48%). Other stratified analyses by age, sex, analysed brain regions, sample size and severity of AD neuropathology showed similar pooled TDP-43 prevalence. Conclusions: Different methodology to access TDP-43, and also differences in lifestyle and genetic factors across different populations could explain our results. Standardization of TDP-43 measurement, and future studies about the impact of genetic and lifestyle characteristics on the development of neurodegenerative diseases are needed.",brain ageing | dementia | elderly | post mortem | TDP-43 proteinopathy,17,0,NIA,P30AG10161,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,2,2018-04-01

Methods All patients were clinically evaluated and prospectively diagnosed at the UCSF Memory and Aging Center. Two consecutive series were included: (1) patients with a clinically diagnosed FTD syndrome who underwent autopsy (cohort 1) and (2) patients with a primary pathologic diagnosis of FTLD, regardless of the clinical syndrome (cohort 2). These series were divided by age at symptom onset (cutoff 65 years). Results In cohort 1, 48 (25.3%) were 65 years or older at symptom onset. Pathologic causes of behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) were similar in the early age at onset (EO) and late age at onset (LO) bvFTD groups. In corticobasal syndrome (CBS), however, the most common pathologic substrate differed according to age at onset: progressive supranuclear palsy (42.9%) in LO-CBS and Alzheimer disease (AD; 40.7%) in EO-CBS. In cohort 2, 57 (28.4%) were classified as LO-FTLD. Regarding FTLD major molecular classes, FTLD with transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa was most common in EO-FTLD (44.4%), whereas FTLD-tau (58.3%) was most common in LO-FTLD. Antemortem diagnosis of a non-FTD syndrome, usually AD-type dementia, was more frequent in LO-FTLD than EO-FTLD (19.3% vs 7.7%, p = 0.017). LO-FTLD was also associated with more prevalent comorbid pathologic changes. Of these, moderate to severe AD neuropathologic change and argyrophilic grain disease were overrepresented among patients who received an antemortem diagnosis of AD-type dementia. Conclusion Patients with FTD and FTLD often develop symptoms after age 65, and age at onset represents an important consideration when making antemortem neuropathologic predictions.",,14,0,NIH,P01AG17856,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2018-03-01

OBJECTIVE To determine the rates of positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid positivity in the main clinical variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective clinical-pathologic case serieswas conducted at a tertiary research clinic specialized in cognitive disorders. Patients were evaluated as part of a prospective, longitudinal research study between January 2002 and December 2015. Inclusion criteria included clinical diagnosis of PPA; availability of complete speech, language, and cognitive testing; magnetic resonance imaging performed within 6 months of the cognitive evaluation; and PET carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B or florbetapir F 18 brain scan results. Of 109 patients referred for evaluation of language symptoms who underwent amyloid brain imaging, 3 were excluded because of incomplete language evaluations, 5 for absence of significant aphasia, and 12 for presenting with significant initial symptoms outside of the language domain, leaving a cohort of 89 patients with PPA. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and pathology results. RESULTS Twenty-eight cases were classified as imaging-supported semantic variant PPA (11 women [39.3%]; mean [SD] age, 64 [7] years), 31 nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (22 women [71.0%]; mean [SD] age, 68 [7] years), 26 logopenic variant PPA (17 women [65.4%]; mean [SD] age, 63 [8] years), and 4 mixed PPA cases. Twenty-four of 28 patients with semantic variant PPA (86%) and 28 of 31 patients with nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (90%) had negative amyloid PET scan results, while 25 of 26 patients with logopenic variant PPA (96%) and 3 of 4 mixed PPA cases (75%) had positive scan results. The amyloid positive semantic variant PPA and nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA cases with available autopsy data (2 of 4 and 2 of 3, respectively) all had a primary frontotemporal lobar degeneration and secondary Alzheimer disease pathologic diagnoses, whereas autopsy of 2 patients with amyloid PET-positive logopenic variant PPA confirmed Alzheimer disease. One mixed PPA patient with a negative amyloid PET scan had Pick disease at autopsy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Primary progressive aphasia variant diagnosis according to the current classification scheme is associated with Alzheimer disease biomarker status, with the logopenic variant being associated with carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B positivity in more than 95%of cases. Furthermore, in the presence of a clinical syndrome highly predictive of frontotemporal lobar degeneration pathology, biomarker positivity for Alzheimer disease may be associated more with mixed pathology rather than primary Alzheimer disease.",,39,1,NIH,DHS04-35516,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2018-03-01

Autopsy studies allow for a direct and complete evaluation of the atherosclerotic disease. We aimed to investigate the frequency of IAD and EAD, their association, and related risk profiles in a large cross-sectional autopsy study. Methods: We measured the intima-media thickness and stenosis of the common (CCA) and internal carotid arteries (ICA), using morphometric measurements. The main outcome was stenosis (≥50%) in the artery with the largest obstruction among the 12 cerebral arteries. We used multivariable logistic regression models to investigate the association between EAD and IAD. Results: In 661 participants (mean age = 71.3 ± 11.7 y, 51% male), stenosis was more common in IAD than in EAD (59% vs. 51%). EAD was associated with Caucasian race, hypertension, and smoking, while IAD was associated with older age, less years of education, hypertension, diabetes, and a previous history of stroke. Stenosis in CCA and ICA was associated with more than two times the odds of having stenosis in the intracranial arteries (CCA: OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.64; 3.28; ICA: OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.76; 3.57).

Although the burden of phopho-tau inclusion is high across these diseases, suggesting a similar vulnerability pattern, a distinct RF-associated clinical phenotype in these diseases indicates the opposite. To compare patterns of RF selective vulnerability to tauopathies, we analyzed 5 RF nuclei in tissue from 14 AD, 14 CBD, 10 PSP, and 3 control cases. Multidimensional quantitative analysis unraveled discernable differences on how these nuclei are vulnerable to AD, CBD, and PSP. For instance, PSP and CBD accrued more tau inclusions than AD in locus coeruleus, suggesting a lower vulnerability to AD. However, locus coeruleus neuronal loss in AD was so extreme that few neurons remained to develop aggregates. Likewise, tau burden in gigantocellular nucleus was low in AD and high in PSP, but few GABAergic neurons were present in AD. This challenges the hypothesis that gigantocellular nucleus neuronal loss underlies REM behavioral disorders because REM behavioral disorders rarely manifests in AD.

The 12-item neuropsychiatric inventory was used to evaluate neuropsychiatric symptoms and CDR-SOB score was used to evaluate dementia status. In Braak I/II, significantly increased odds were detected for agitation, anxiety, appetite changes, depression, and sleep disturbances, compared to controls. Increased odds of agitation continue into Braak III/IV. Braak V/VI is associated with higher odds for delusions. No increased odds for neuropsychiatric symptoms were found to correlate with amyloid-β pathology.

Previous reports have shown that the genome of neuronal cells displays somatic genomic mosaicism including DNA copy number variations (CNVs). CNVs represent a significant source of genetic variation in the human genome and have been implicated in several disorders and complex traits, representing a potential mechanism that contributes to neuronal diversity and the etiology of several neurological diseases and provides new insights into the normal, complex functions of the brain. Nonetheless, the features of somatic CNV mosaicism in nondiseased elderly brains have not been investigated. In the present study, we demonstrate a highly significant increase in the number of CNVs in nondiseased elderly brains compared to the blood. In two neural tissues isolated from paired postmortem samples (same individuals), we found a significant increase in the frequency of deletions in both brain areas, namely, the frontal cortex and cerebellum. Also, deletions were found to be significantly larger when present only in the cerebellum. The sizes of the variants described here were in the 150-760 kb range, and importantly, nearly all of them were present in the Database of Genomic Variants (common variants). Nearly all evidence of genome structural variation in human brains comes from studies detecting changes in single cells which were interpreted as derived from independent, isolated mutational events. The observations based on array-CGH analysis indicate the existence of an extensive clonal mosaicism of CNVs within and between the human brains revealing a different type of variation that had not been previously characterized.",,6,1,FAPESP,2013/08028-1,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,papers by authors,1,2018-01-01

The role of the cholinergic deficit in AD pathophysiology has mainly been studied in experimental animal models and in neuropathologic examinations of human autopsy data of advanced disease stages. Interactions between cholinergic deficits and accumulation of cortical amyloid pathology point to a relevant role of BFCS degeneration for the preclinical stage of AD. The advent of novel computational morphometry techniques for the automated analysis of high-resolution MRI data allows studying AD-related atrophy in the living human brain with ever-increasing temporal and regional detail. Combining these morphometry techniques with recently developed stereotactic mappings of the BFCS provides a method for automated MRI-based volumetry that can sensitively assess degenerative changes of the BFCS in vivo. Here, we outline the general methodological approach for MRI-based BFCS volumetry and describe the specifics of different image processing choices and analysis strategies. We further discuss possibilities and limitations of this method for studying BFCS degeneration in the course of AD, with a special emphasis on using MRI-based BFCS volumetry as an imaging biomarker for defining the preclinical disease stage.",Amyloid pathology | Cholinergic basal forebrain | Morphometry | MRI | Nucleus basalis Meynert | Substantia innominata,4,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2018-01-01

We also examined potential risk factors for brain atrophy, including demographics and clinical variables. Methods: In this study, 1373 participants (787 male) aged 50 years or older who died from natural causes were included. Participants with no reliable informant, with cognitive impairment or dementia, with a medical history of severe chronic disease, or with prolonged agonal state were excluded. Presence of MDD at least once in their lifetime was defined according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM. Brain volume was measured immediately after removal from the skull. Results: Mean age at death was 68.6 ± 11.6, and MDD was present in 185 (14%) individuals. Smaller brain volume was associated with older age (p < 0.001), lower education (years; p < 0.001), hypertension (p = 0.001), diabetes (p = 0.006), and female gender (p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis adjusted for sociodemographics and cardiovascular risk factors, smaller brain volume was not associated with major depression (β = −0.86, 95% CI = −26.50 to 24.77, p = 0.95). Conclusions: In this large autopsy study of older adults, MDD was not associated with smaller brain volumes.

We sought to improve pathological prediction by exploring clinicopathological correlations in a large bvFTD cohort. Among 438 patients in whom bvFTD was either the top or an alternative possible clinical diagnosis, 117 had available autopsy data, including 98 with a primary pathological diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 15 with Alzheimer's disease, and four with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis who lacked neurodegenerative disease-related pathology outside of the motor system. Patients with FTLD were distributed between FTLD-tau (34 patients: 10 corticobasal degeneration, nine progressive supranuclear palsy, eight Pick's disease, three frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism associated with chromosome 17, three unclassifiable tauopathy, and one argyrophilic grain disease); FTLD-TDP (55 patients: nine type A including one with motor neuron disease, 27 type B including 21 with motor neuron disease, eight type C with right temporal lobe presentations, and 11 unclassifiable including eight with motor neuron disease), FTLD-FUS (eight patients), and one patient with FTLD-ubiquitin proteasome system positive inclusions (FTLD-UPS) that stained negatively for tau, TDP-43, and FUS. Alzheimer's disease was uncommon (6%) among patients whose only top diagnosis during follow-up was bvFTD. Seventy-nine per cent of FTLD-tau, 86% of FTLD-TDP, and 88% of FTLD-FUS met at least 'possible' bvFTD diagnostic criteria at first presentation. The frequency of the six core bvFTD diagnostic features was similar in FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, suggesting that these features alone cannot be used to separate patients by major molecular class. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that nearly all pathological subgroups and even individual patients share atrophy in anterior cingulate, frontoinsula, striatum, and amygdala, indicating that degeneration of these regions is intimately linked to the behavioural syndrome produced by these diverse aetiologies. In addition to these unifying features, symptom profiles also differed among pathological subtypes, suggesting distinct anatomical vulnerabilities and informing a clinician's prediction of pathological diagnosis. Data-driven classification into one of the 10 most common pathological diagnoses was most accurate (up to 60.2%) when using a combination of known predictive factors (genetic mutations, motor features, or striking atrophy patterns) and the results of a discriminant function analysis that incorporated clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological data.",Alzheimer's disease | corticobasal degeneration | frontotemporal dementia | frontotemporal lobar degeneration | Pick's disease,103,1,NIA,P01AG17856,Foundation for the National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2017-12-01

Methods: A total of 20 PSP and 16 healthy older adult controls participated in this study. The participants underwent an overnight polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) the following day. Prior to the MSLT last trial, they were asked to complete the Stanford Sleepiness Scale. Data were assessed for measures of latency to sleep onset, sleep duration, waking, and sleep staging during the night. Mean sleep latency, a measure of daytime sleepiness, sleep onset rapid eye movement (REM) periods, and microsleeps were studied with the MSLT. Spectral analysis of wake electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed for 30-second periods at the start of each MSLT trial. Results: PSP took significantly longer time to fall asleep (p < .001), slept less during the night (p ≤ .001), and had more wake after sleep onset than controls (p ≤ .001). PSP had less N2 sleep (p < .05) and N3 sleep (p < .05), and REM sleep (p < .001) than controls. During the MSLT, PSP took significantly longer to fall asleep (p < .001), did not have microsleeps when they remained awake throughout the assessment periods, but were subjectively sleepier than controls (p < .05). Gamma power was increased during wake EEG in PSP (p < .01). Conclusions: Sleep/waking regulation and REM sleep regulation are disrupted in PSP, leading to profound sleep deprivation without recuperation. Our findings suggest a diminished homeostatic sleep drive in PSP. This hyperaroused state is unique and is a severely disabling feature of PSP.",Homeostatic sleep drive | Hyperarousal | Multiple sleep latency test | Neurodegenerative disease | Spectral analysis,15,1,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2017-11-01

Objective: To explore the association between diabetes and the neuropathological etiology of dementia in a large autopsy study. Methods: Data were collected from the participants of the Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group between 2004 and 2015. Diagnosis of diabetes was reported by the deceased’s next-of-kin. Clinical dementia was established when CDR≥1 and IQCODE>3.41. Dementia etiology was determined by neuropathological examination using immunohistochemistry. The association of diabetes with odds of dementia was investigated using multivariate logistic regression. Results: We included 1,037 subjects and diabetes was present in 279 participants (27%). The prevalence of dementia diagnosis was similar in diabetics (29%) and non-diabetics (27%). We found no association between diabetes and dementia (OR=1.22; 95%CI=0.81-1.82; p=0.34) on the multivariate analysis. AD was the main cause of dementia in both groups, while VaD was the second-most-frequent cause in diabetics.

We compared in vivo 18F-flortaucipir uptake in patients meeting clinical research criteria for PSP (n = 33) to normal controls (n = 46) and patients meeting criteria for Parkinson disease (PD; n = 26). Methods: Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography for amyloid-β (11C-PiB or 18F-florbetapir) and tau (18F-flortaucipir). 18F-flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratios were calculated (t = 80–100 minutes, cerebellum gray matter reference). Voxelwise and region-of-interest group comparisons were performed in template space, with receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to assess single-subject discrimination. Qualitative comparisons with postmortem tau are reported in 1 patient who died 9 months after 18F-flortaucipir. Results: Clinical PSP patients showed bilaterally elevated 18F-flortaucipir uptake in globus pallidus, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain, and dentate nucleus relative to controls and PD patients (voxelwise p < 0.05 family wise error corrected). Globus pallidus binding best distinguished PSP patients from controls and PD (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.872 vs controls, AUC = 0.893 vs PD). PSP clinical severity did not correlate with 18F-flortaucipir in any region. A patient with clinical PSP and pathological diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration had severe tau pathology in PSP-related brain structures with good correspondence between in vivo 18F-flortaucipir and postmortem tau neuropathology. Interpretation: 18F-flortaucipir uptake was elevated in PSP versus controls and PD patients in a pattern consistent with the expected distribution of tau pathology.

However, the few autopsy studies that have investigated the association of visceral fat with atherosclerosis had small sample sizes and focused on coronary arteries of young or middle-aged White subjects. We aimed to investigate the association of pericardial fat (PF) and abdominal visceral fat (AVF) with atherosclerosis in the aorta, coronary, carotid, and cerebral arteries in a large autopsy study. Materials and methods: We evaluated deceased subjects aged 30 years or above. We dissected and weighted the PF and the AVF and evaluated the atherosclerotic burden in the aorta, as well as the carotid, coronary, and cerebral arteries using morphometric measurements. We also investigated the interaction of PF and AVF with age regarding the atherosclerotic burden. Results: The mean age of the 240 included subjects was 64.8±15.3 years, and 63% was male. Greater PF was associated with a higher degree of aortic atherosclerosis after adjusting for confounding variables (coefficient = 4.39, 95% CI = 0.83; 7.94, p = 0.02). Greater AVF was associated with a higher coronary stenosis index (coefficient = 1.49, 95% CI = 0.15; 2.83, p = 0.03) and a greater number of coronary plaques (coefficient = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.24; 1.19, p = 0.003). We did not find an association of PF or AVF with carotid or cerebral atherosclerotic burden. We found a significant interaction of AVF (coefficient = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.14; -0.02, p = 0.009) and PF (coefficient = -0.87, 95% CI = -1.70; -0.04, p = 0.04) with age regarding carotid artery atherosclerotic burden. Conclusions: Greater AVF was associated with greater atherosclerotic burden and extent in coronary arteries, while greater PF correlated with a higher degree of atherosclerosis in the aorta.",,3,1,CAPES,1074888,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior,papers by authors,4,2017-10-01

ApoE4 increases brain amyloid-β pathology relative to other ApoE isoforms1. However, whether APOE independently influences tau pathology, the other major proteinopathy of Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, or tau-mediated neurodegeneration, is not clear. By generating P301S tau transgenic mice on either a human ApoE knock-in (KI) or ApoE knockout (KO) background, here we show that P301S/E4 mice have significantly higher tau levels in the brain and a greater extent of somatodendritic tau redistribution by three months of age compared with P301S/E2, P301S/E3, and P301S/EKO mice. By nine months of age, P301S mice with different ApoE genotypes display distinct phosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) staining patterns. P301S/E4 mice develop markedly more brain atrophy and neuroinflammation than P301S/E2 and P301S/E3 mice, whereas P301S/EKO mice are largely protected from these changes. In vitro, E4-expressing microglia exhibit higher innate immune reactivity after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Co-culturing P301S tau-expressing neurons with E4-expressing mixed glia results in a significantly higher level of tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion and markedly reduced neuronal viability compared with neuron/E2 and neuron/E3 co-cultures. Neurons co-cultured with EKO glia showed the greatest viability with the lowest level of secreted TNF-α. Treatment of P301S neurons with recombinant ApoE (E2, E3, E4) also leads to some neuronal damage and death compared with the absence of ApoE, with ApoE4 exacerbating the effect. In individuals with a sporadic primary tauopathy, the presence of an ε4 allele is associated with more severe regional neurodegeneration. In individuals who are positive for amyloid-β pathology with symptomatic Alzheimer disease who usually have tau pathology, ε4-carriers demonstrate greater rates of disease progression. Our results demonstrate that ApoE affects tau pathogenesis, neuroinflammation, and tau-mediated neurodegeneration independently of amyloid-β pathology. ApoE4 exerts a ‘toxic’ gain of function whereas the absence of ApoE is protective.",,398,0,,K23 AG055688,,papers by authors,0,2017-09-01

Qualitative evidence identifies ht-NCI accumulating in the isodendritic core before the entorhinal cortex. Here, we used unbiased stereology to quantify ht-NCI burden in the locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), aiming to characterize the impact of AD pathology in these nuclei with a focus on early stages. Methods: We utilized unbiased stereology in a sample of 48 well-characterized subjects enriched for controls and early AD stages. ht-NCI counts were estimated in 60-μm-thick sections immunostained for p-tau throughout LC and DRN. Data were integrated with unbiased estimates of LC and DRN neuronal population for a subset of cases. Results: In Braak stage 0, 7.9% and 2.6% of neurons in LC and DRN, respectively, harbour ht-NCIs. Although the number of ht-NCI+ neurons significantly increased by about 1.9× between Braak stages 0 to I in LC (P = 0.02), we failed to detect any significant difference between Braak stage I and II. Also, the number of ht-NCI+ neurons remained stable in DRN between all stages 0 and II. Finally, the differential susceptibility to tau inclusions among nuclear subdivisions was more notable in LC than in DRN. Conclusions: LC and DRN neurons exhibited ht-NCI during AD precortical stages. The ht-NCI increases along AD progression on both nuclei, but quantitative changes in LC precede DRN changes.",Alzheimer disease | brain stem | dorsal raphe nucleus | Human | locus coeruleus | unbiased stereology,68,0,NIH,24AG053435,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2017-08-01

However, it is a deep-seated brainstem nucleus without clear imaging or electrophysiological markers. Some studies suggested that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may help guiding electrode placement in the PPN by showing the surrounding fiber bundles, but none have provided a direct histological correlation. We investigated DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from in vivo and in situ post-mortem magnetic resonance images (MRI) compared to histological evaluations for improving PPN targeting in humans. A post-mortem brain was scanned in a clinical 3T MR system in situ. Thereafter, the brain was processed with a special method ideally suited for cytoarchitectonic analyses. Also, nine volunteers had in vivo brain scanning using the same MRI protocol. Images from volunteers were compared to those obtained in the post-mortem study. FA values of the volunteers were obtained from PPN, inferior colliculus, cerebellar crossing fibers and medial lemniscus using histological data and atlas information. FA values in the PPN were significantly lower than in the surrounding white matter region and higher than in areas with predominantly gray matter. In Nissl-stained histologic sections, the PPN extended for more than 10 mm in the rostro-caudal axis being closely attached to the lateral parabrachial nucleus. Our DTI analyses and the spatial correlation with histological findings proposed a location for PPN that matched the position assigned to this nucleus in the literature.

To facilitate the consistent identification of ARTAG and to distinguish it from astroglial tau pathologies observed in the primary frontotemporal lobar degeneration tauopathies we evaluated how consistently neuropathologists recognize (1) different astroglial tau immunoreactivities, including those of ARTAG and those associated with primary tauopathies (Study 1); (2) ARTAG types (Study 2A); and (3) ARTAG severity (Study 2B). Microphotographs and scanned sections immunostained for phosphorylated tau (AT8) were made available for download and preview. Percentage of agreement and kappa values with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each evaluation. The overall agreement for Study 1 was > 60% with a kappa value of 0.55 (95% CI 0.433-0.645). Moderate agreement (> 90%, kappa 0.48, 95% CI 0.457-0.900) was reached in Study 2A for the identification of ARTAG pathology for each ARTAG subtype (kappa 0.37-0.72), whereas fair agreement (kappa 0.40, 95% CI 0.341-0.445) was reached for the evaluation of ARTAG severity. The overall assessment of ARTAG showed moderate agreement (kappa 0.60, 95% CI 0.534-0.653) among raters.

These criteria have not been readily comparable, impacting on clinical diagnosis rates and in turn prevalence estimates, research, and treatment. Methods The Vascular Impairment of Cognition Classification Consensus Study (VICCCS) involved participants (81% academic researchers) from 27 countries in an online Delphi consensus study. Participants reviewed previously proposed concepts to develop new guidelines. Results VICCCS had a mean of 122 (98–153) respondents across the study and a 67% threshold to represent consensus. VICCCS redefined VCI including classification of mild and major forms of VCI and subtypes. It proposes new standardized VCI-associated terminology and future research priorities to address gaps in current knowledge.

It is widely applied in assessing disease mechanisms and in drug discovery research. Automation of IF analysis can transform studies using experimental cell models. However, IF analysis of postmortem human tissue relies mostly on manual interaction, often subjected to low-throughput and prone to error, leading to low inter and intra-observer reproducibility. Human postmortem brain samples challenges neuroscientists because of the high level of autofluorescence caused by accumulation of lipofuscin pigment during aging, hindering systematic analyses. We propose a method for automating cell counting and classification in IF microscopy of human postmortem brains. Our algorithm speeds up the quantification task while improving reproducibility. New method Dictionary learning and sparse coding allow for constructing improved cell representations using IF images. These models are input for detection and segmentation methods. Classification occurs by means of color distances between cells and a learned set. Results Our method successfully detected and classified cells in 49 human brain images. We evaluated our results regarding true positive, false positive, false negative, precision, recall, false positive rate and F1 score metrics. We also measured user-experience and time saved compared to manual countings. Comparison with existing methods We compared our results to four open-access IF-based cell-counting tools available in the literature. Our method showed improved accuracy for all data samples.

Although almost 60% of individuals with dementia live in developing countries, few clinicopathological studies focus on these individuals. We investigated the frequency of neurodegenerative and vascular-related neuropathological lesions in 1,092 Brazilian admixed older adults, their correlation with cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and the accuracy of dementia subtype diagnosis. Methods and findings: In this cross-sectional study, we describe clinical and neuropathological variables related to cognitive impairment in 1,092 participants (mean age = 74 y, 49% male, 69% white, and mean education = 4 y). Cognitive function was investigated using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE); neuropsychiatric symptoms were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Associations between neuropathological lesions and cognitive impairment were investigated using ordinal logistic regression. We developed a neuropathological comorbidity (NPC) score and compared it to CDR, IQCODE, and NPI scores. We also described and compared the frequency of neuropathological diagnosis to clinical diagnosis of dementia subtype. Forty-four percent of the sample met criteria for neuropathological diagnosis. Among these participants, 50% had neuropathological diagnoses of Alzheimer disease (AD), and 35% of vascular dementia (VaD). Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), hippocampal sclerosis, lacunar infarcts, hyaline atherosclerosis, siderocalcinosis, and Lewy body disease were independently associated with cognitive impairment. Higher NPC scores were associated with worse scores in the CDR sum of boxes (β = 1.33, 95% CI 1.20–1.46), IQCODE (β = 0.14, 95% CI 0.13–0.16), and NPI (β = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.33–2.16). Compared to neuropathological diagnoses, clinical diagnosis had high sensitivity to AD and high specificity to dementia with Lewy body/Parkinson dementia. The major limitation of our study is the lack of clinical follow-up of participants during life. Conclusions: NFT deposition, vascular lesions, and high NPC scorewere associated with cognitive impairment in a unique Brazilian sample with low education. Our results confirm the high prevalence of neuropathological diagnosis in older adults and the mismatch between clinical and neuropathological diagnoses.",,41,1,NIA,K24AG053435,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2017-03-01

Methods: Extensive clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data were collected from 69 patients with sporadic PPA, divided into 29 semantic (svPPA), 25 nonfluent (nfvPPA), 11 logopenic (lvPPA), and 4 mixed PPA. Patterns of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy at presentation were assessed and tested as predictors of pathological diagnosis using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. Results: A clinical diagnosis of PPA was associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP) inclusions in 40.5%, FTLD-tau in 40.5%, and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology in 19% of cases. Each variant was associated with 1 typical pathology; 24 of 29 (83%) svPPA showed FTLD-TDP type C, 22 of 25 (88%) nfvPPA showed FTLD-tau, and all 11 lvPPA had AD. Within FTLD-tau, 4R-tau pathology was commonly associated with nfvPPA, whereas Pick disease was observed in a minority of subjects across all variants except for lvPPA. Compared with pathologically typical cases, svPPA-tau showed significant extrapyramidal signs, greater executive impairment, and severe striatal and frontal GM and WM atrophy. nfvPPA-TDP patients lacked general motor symptoms or significant WM atrophy. Combining GM and WM volumes, SVM analysis showed 92.7% accuracy to distinguish FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP pathologies across variants. Interpretation: Each PPA clinical variant is associated with a typical and most frequent cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropathological profile. Specific clinical and early anatomical features may suggest rare and atypical pathological diagnosis in vivo.

The brainstem's locus coeruleus (LC) is the first area to develop neurofibrillary changes (neurofibrillary tangles [NFTs]). Methods The methods include unbiased stereological analyses in human brainstems to estimate LC volume and neuronal population in controls and individuals across all AD stages. Results As the Braak stage increases by 1 unit, the LC volume decreases by 8.4%. Neuronal loss started only midway through AD progression. Age-related changes spare the LC. Discussion The long gap between NFT accumulation and neuronal loss suggests that a second trigger may be necessary to induce neuronal death in AD. Imaging studies should determine whether LC volumetry can replicate the stage-wise atrophy observed here and how these changes are specific to AD. LC volumetry may develop into a screening biomarker for selecting high-yield candidates to undergo expensive and less accessible positron emission tomography scans and to monitor AD progression from presymptomatic stages.",Alzheimer's disease | Brainstem | Human | Locus coeruleus | Neurofibrillary tangles | Neuron counts | Postmortem | Unbiased stereology | Volumetry,120,0,NIH,LIM-22/FMUSP,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2017-03-01

Objective: To investigate the association between diabetes and AD neuropathology in a large autopsy study of older Brazilian adults. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, diabetes was defined by diagnosis during life or use of antidiabetic medication. A standardized neuropathological examination was performed using immunohistochemistry. The associations of diabetes with Consortium to Establish and Registry for Alzheimer Disease (CERAD) scores for neuritic plaques and Braak-Braak (BB) scores for neurofibrillary tangles were investigated using multivariable ordinal logistic regression.

We assessed the relative contribution of neuritic plaques (NPs), diffuse plaques (DPs) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) to regional PIB SUVR using multi-linear regression. In experiment 1, there were no differences in Area Under the Curve for amyloid phase ≥ A2 and CERAD score ≥ C2 between global and highest regional PiB SUVR (p = 0.186 and 0.230). In experiment 2, when NPs, DPs, and/or CAA were included in the same model, moderate to severe NPs were independently correlated with PiB SUVR in all regions except for the inferior temporal and calcarine ROI (β = 0.414–0.804, p < 0.05), whereas DPs were independently correlated with PiB SUVR in the angular gyrus ROI (β = 0.446, p = 0.010).

In order to improve brain understanding as part of diagnostic tasks using MRI images, other imaging modalities to obtain deep cerebral structures and cytoarchitectural boundaries have been investigated. Under availability of postmortem samples, the fusion of MRI to brain histology supports more accurate description of neuroanatomical structures since it preserves microscopic entities and reveal fine anatomical details, unavailable otherwise. Nonetheless, histological processing causes severe tissue deformation and loss of the brain original 3D conformation, preventing direct comparisons between MRI and histology. This paper proposes an interactive computational pipeline designed to register multimodal brain data and enable direct histology-MRI correlation. Our main contribution is to develop schemes for brain data fusion, distortion corrections, using appropriate diffeomorphic mappings to align the 3D histological and MRI volumes. We describe our pipeline and preliminary developments of scalable processing schemes for highresolution images. Tests consider a postmortem human brain, and include qualitatively and quantitatively results, such as 3D visualizations and the Dice coefficient (DC) between brain structures. Preliminary results show promising DC values when comparing our scheme results to manually labeled neuroanatomical regions defined by a neurosurgeon on MRI and histology data sets. DC was computed for the left caudade gyrus (LC), right hippocampus (RH) and lateral ventricles (LV).",,9,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2016-12-01

Among the tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common, whereas argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), chronic traumatic encepha-lopathy (CTE), Pick's disease (PiD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are less prevalent. Brain extracts from deceased individuals with PiD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by three-repeat (3R) tau prions, were used to infect HEK293T cells expressing 3R tau fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Extracts from AGD, CBD, and PSP patient samples, which contain four-repeat (4R) tau prions, were transmitted to HEK293 cells expressing 4R tau fused to YFP. These studies demonstrated that prion propagation in HEK cells requires isoform pairing between the infecting prion and the recipient substrate. Interestingly, tau aggregates in AD and CTE, containing both 3R and 4R isoforms, were unable to robustly infect either 3R-or 4R-expressing cells. However, AD and CTE prions were able to replicate in HEK293T cells expressing both 3R and 4R tau. Unexpectedly, increasing the level of 4R isoform expression alone supported the propagation of both AD and CTE prions. These results allowed us to determine the levels of tau prions in AD and CTE brain extracts.",Argyrophilic grain disease | Corticobasal degeneration | Pick's disease | Progressive supranuclear palsy | Tauopathies,88,1,NIH,AG023501,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2016-12-01

Methods: In this case-control study, we reviewed the clinical histories of 66 patients with FTD/ MND and 57 symptomatic C9 carriers (24 overlapping cases), a total of 99 charts, for history of autoimmune disease. The prevalence of autoimmune disease in C9 and FTD/MND cohorts was determined by x2 and Fisher exact comparisons between the combined C9 and FTD/MND group with normal control, Alzheimer disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy cohorts, as well as comparisons within C9 and FTD/MND cohorts. Results: Our combined C9 and FTD/MND cohort has a 12% prevalence of nonthyroid autoimmune disease. The prevalence of nonthyroid autoimmune disease in C9 and FTD/MND is similar to the rates in previously detailed progranulin and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia cohorts and elevated in comparison to previously collected normal control and typical Alzheimer disease cohorts, as well as a newly screened progressive supranuclear palsy cohort. Furthermore, the types of autoimmune disease in this combined C9 and FTD/MND cohort cluster within the same 3 categories previously described in progranulin and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia: inflammatory arthritides, cutaneous conditions, and gastrointestinal disorders. Conclusions: The association between selective autoimmune disease and neurodegenerative disorders unified by the underlying pathology frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) extends to C9 and FTD/MND cohorts, providing further evidence that select autoimmune inflammation may be intrinsically linked to FTLDTDP pathophysiology.",,47,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2016-12-01

OBJECTIVE To identify subtypes of bvFTD syndrome based on distinctive patterns of atrophy defined by selective vulnerability of specific functional networks targeted in bvFTD using statistical classification approaches. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective observational study, 90 patients meeting the Frontotemporal Dementia Consortium consensus criteria for bvFTD underwent evaluation at the Memory and Aging Center of the Department of Neurology at University of California, San Francisco. Patients underwent a multidisciplinary clinical evaluation, including clinical demographics, genetic testing, symptom evaluation, neurologic examination, neuropsychological bedside testing, and socioemotional assessments. All patients underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging at their earliest evaluation at the memory clinic. From each patient's structural imaging scans, the mean volumes of 18 regions of interest (ROI) constituting the functional networks specifically vulnerable in bvFTD, including the salience network (SN), with key nodes in the frontoinsula and pregenual anterior cingulate, and the semantic appraisal network (SAN), anchored in the anterior temporal lobe and subgenual cingulate, were estimated. Principal component and cluster analyses of ROI volumes were used to identify patient clusters with anatomically distinct atrophy patterns. Data were collected from from June 19, 2002, to January 13, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Evaluation of brain morphology and other clinical features, including presenting symptoms, neurologic examination signs, neuropsychological performance, rate of dementia progression, and socioemotional function, in each patient cluster. RESULTS Ninety patients (54 men [60%]; 36 women [40%]; mean [SD] age at evaluation, 55.1 [9.7] years) were included in the analysis. Four subgroups of patients with bvFTD with distinct anatomic patterns of network degeneration were identified, including 2 salience network-predominant subgroups (frontal/temporal [SN-FT] and frontal [SN-F]), a semantic appraisal network-predominant group (SAN), and a subcortical-predominant group. Subgroups demonstrated distinct patterns of cognitive, socioemotional, and motor symptoms, as well as genetic compositions and estimated rates of disease progression. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Divergent patterns of vulnerability in specific functional network components make an important contribution to the clinical heterogeneity of bvFTD. The data-driven anatomic classification identifies biologically meaningful anatomic phenotypes and provides a replicable approach to disambiguate the bvFTD syndrome.",,71,1,NIH,K23AG021606,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2016-09-01

Our hypothesis is that the properties of WMH would be different from normal appearing white matter (NAWM) in the DTI images in postmortem. Materials and methods We analyzed PM MR images from 24 subjects (12 males; mean age: 67.2±14.7 years) and in vivo (IV) MR images from 10 healthy volunteers (5 males; mean age: 62.3±5.49 years). DTI processing was performed using the FSL platform; ROIs were placed at WMH and NAWM at FA and ADC maps. Results PM group presented FA values 26.75% lower at WMH than in NAWM. IV Mean FA in WMH was also reduced (17.76%) compared to NAWM. Average ADC from PM subjects was 6.89% higher at WMH than NAWM and 12.51% higher at WMH than NAWM at IV group. Conclusions We have demonstrated that in situ postmortem FA values at WMH are lower than NAWM, similar to in vivo data. This indicates that DTI obtained at a short postmortem interval from PM MRI could be used to understand in vivo MRI data.",Diffusion tensor imaging | MRI | Post-mortem | White matter hyperintensities,0,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2016-09-01

By using the isotropic fractionator to estimate absolute cell numbers in selected brain regions, we looked for sex- and age-related differences in 32 medial temporal lobes (comprised basically by the hippocampal formation, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus), sixteen male (29–92 years) and sixteen female (25–82); and 31 cerebella, seventeen male (29–92 years) and fourteen female (25–82). These regions were dissected from the brain, fixed and homogenized, and then labeled with a DNA-marker (to count all nuclei) and with a neuron-specific nuclear marker (to estimate neuron number). Total number of cells in the medial temporal lobe was found to be 1.91 billion in men, and 1.47 billion in women, a difference of 23 %. This region showed 34 % more neurons in men than in women: 525.1 million against 347.4 million. In contrast, no sex differences were found in the cerebellum. Regarding the influence of age, a quadratic correlation was found between neuronal numbers and age in the female medial temporal lobe, suggesting an early increase followed by slight decline after age 50. The cerebellum showed numerical stability along aging for both neurons and non-neuronal cells. In sum, results indicate a sex-related regional difference in total and neuronal cell numbers in the medial temporal lobe, but not in the cerebellum. On the other hand, aging was found to impact on cell numbers in the medial temporal lobe, while the cerebellum proved resilient to neuronal losses in the course of life.",Aging | Brain cellularity | Isotropic fractionator | Sexual dimorphism,4,0,ITN,undefined,Institute for Translational Neuroscience,papers by authors,2,2016-09-01

The substantia nigra (SN), the source of major dopaminergic pathways in the brain, is particularly vulnerable to changes in the progression of several age-related neurodegenerative diseases. To establish normative data for high-resolution imaging, and to further clinical and anatomical studies we analyzed SNs from 15 subjects aged 50–91 cognitively normal human subjects without signs of parkinsonism. Complete brains or brainstems with substantia nigra were formalin-fixed, celloidin-mounted, serially cut and Nissl-stained. The shapes of all SNs investigated were reconstructed using fast, high-resolution computer-assisted 3D reconstruction software. We found a negative correlation between age and SN volume (p = 0.04, rho = −0.53), with great variability in neuronal numbers and density across participants. The 3D reconstructions revealed SN inter- and intra-individual variability. Furthermore, we observed that human SN is a neuronal reticulum, rather than a group of isolated neuronal islands. Caution is required when using SN volume as a surrogate for SN status in individual subjects.

Discussion: Here, we review and discuss both the neuropathological and in vivo imaging characteristics of cerebrovascular disease, prevalence rates of vascular dementia, and clinico-pathological correlations. We also discuss the frequent comorbidity of cerebrovascular pathology and Alzheimer's disease pathology, as well as the difficult and controversial issue of clinically differentiating between Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and mixed Alzheimer's disease/vascular dementia. Finally, we consider additional novel approaches to complement and enhance current post-mortem assessment of cerebral human tissue.

However, few autopsy studies have investigated this association, and they had only examined the coronary artery disease. Moreover, most studies had small sample sizes and were limited to middle-aged or young adults. Our aim is to investigate the association between adiposity and systemic atherosclerosis in an autopsy study. Methods and analysis: A sample of 240 deceased with 30 years or more will be evaluated. The sample size was calculated using the lowest correlation coefficient found in previous studies (r=0.109), assuming a power of 90% and α=0.05. We will collect information about sociodemographics, frequency of previous contact of the deceased's next of kin and cardiovascular risk factors. We will measure neck, waist and hip circumferences, weight, height and abdominal subcutaneous tissue thickness, and then we will calculate the body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio and body shape index. We will also weigh the pericardial and abdominal visceral fat, the heart, and we will measure the left ventricular wall thickness. We will evaluate the presence of myocardial infarction, the degree of atherosclerosis in the aorta, carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries and plaque composition in carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries. For each individual, we will fix arterial and adipose tissue samples in 10% formalin and freeze another adipose tissue sample at -80°C for future studies. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of University of Sao Paulo Medical School, Brazil.

AGD was associated with older age, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and appetite disorders. This is the first study of demographic, clinical, and neuropathological aspects of AGD in different ethnicities and subjects from all socioeconomic strata. The results suggest that prospective studies of AGD patients include levels of hormones related to appetite control as possible antemortem markers.

Loss of polarized distribution of the axonal protein tau is an early sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. The cytoskeletal network in the axon initial segment (AIS) forms a barrier between the axon and the somatodentritic compartment, contributing to axonal retention of tau. Although perturbation of the AIS cytoskeleton has been implicated in neurological disorders, the molecular triggers and functional consequence of AIS perturbation are incompletely understood. Results: Here we report that tau acetylation and consequent destabilization of the AIS cytoskeleton promote the somatodendritic mislocalization of tau. AIS cytoskeletal proteins, including ankyrin G and βIV-spectrin, were downregulated in AD brains and negatively correlated with an increase in tau acetylated at K274 and K281. AIS proteins were also diminished in transgenic mice expressing tauK274/281Q, a tau mutant that mimics K274 and K281 acetylation. In primary neuronal cultures, the tauK274/281Q mutant caused hyperdynamic microtubules (MTs) in the AIS, shown by live-imaging of MT mobility and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Using photoconvertible tau constructs, we found that axonal tauK274/281Q was missorted into the somatodendritic compartment. Stabilizing MTs with epothilone D to restore the cytoskeletal barrier in the AIS prevented tau mislocalization in primary neuronal cultures. Conclusions: Together, these findings demonstrate that tau acetylation contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease by compromising the cytoskeletal sorting machinery in the AIS.",Alzheimer's disease | Axon initial segment | Neuronal cytoskeleton | Neuronal polarity | Tau acetylation,68,1,NIH,P50AG023501,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2016-06-01

In two small studies, blood pressure and core body temperature circadian patterns were disrupted in PSP; however, it is unclear if circadian activity rhythms are also affected. Our objective was to perform circadian analyses of the rest-activity rhythms in PSP and determine the association with increasing disease severity. Patients/Methods Individuals with a clinical PSP diagnosis (n = 17; nine men) and healthy older adults (n = 17; nine men) were selected for this study. Participants wore actigraphy wristbands and completed sleep diaries for up to 14 consecutive days. Data were analyzed to assess circadian activity strength (amplitude, mesor, f-ratio), phase (acrophase), and circadian stability (intradaily variability, interdaily stability, relative amplitude). Analyses controlled for sleep fragmentation, cognition, and self-reported depression. The association between disease severity using the PSP rating scale and circadian activity rhythm disruption was assessed. Results Individuals with PSP had significantly lower circadian activity mesor (p ≤ 0.001), amplitude (p ≤ 0.001), robustness (f-ratio, p < 0.01), relative amplitude (p ≤ 0.001), and interdaily stability (p ≤ 0.01), with increased intradaily variability (p < 0.05). CAR remained weaker in PSP after controlling for sleep fragmentation, and again when also controlling for cognitive impairment and depression. Weaker circadian activity (mesor, amplitude, f-ratio, and relative amplitude) was associated with increased disease severity.

We used high-resolution MRI, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET), and neuropsychological test data of 132 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 177 cognitively normal controls to determine associations between BF atrophy, cortical hypometabolism, and cognitive deficits. BF atrophy in MCI correlated with both impaired memory function and attentional control deficits, whereas hippocampus volume was more specifically associated with memory deficits.

OBJECTIVE To characterize the neurological, cognitive, and neuroimaging features of patients with nfvPPA-in whom either PSP or CBD was eventually confirmed at autopsy-at initial presentation and at 1-year follow-up. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective longitudinal clinical-pathological study was conducted in a tertiary research clinic that specialized in cognitive disorders. Fourteen patients were evaluated between January 2002 and December 2014. Inclusion criteria for the study were a clinical diagnosis of nfvPPA; the availability of speech, language, and cognitive testing for at least 1 evaluation; magnetic resonance imaging within 6 months of initial evaluation; and a postmortem pathological diagnosis of PSP or CBD. Ten matched healthy control participants were also included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging longitudinal datawere analyzed to characterize the whole nfvPPA-4-repeat-tau group and identify differences between nfvPPA-PSP and nfvPPA-CBD both at presentation and longitudinally. RESULTS Patient groups did not differ significantly in age, sex, or handedness (nfvPPA-PSP group: median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 74 [67-76] years; 1 of 5 male [20%]; 1 of 5 left-handed [20%]; and nfvPPA-CBD group: mean [IQR] age, 65 [54-81] years; 3 of 9 male [33%]; 0 left-handed). Motor speech impairment and left frontal white matter atrophy were the most prominent common features. At presentation, dysarthria (Motor Speech Examination median [IQR] score: nfvPPA-PSP, 4 [2-7]; nfvPPA-CBD, 0 [0-4]; P = .02), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale median [IQR] score: nfvPPA-PSP, 19 [3-28]; nfvPPA-CBD, 4 [0-16]; P = .04), and relatively selective white matter atrophy were typical of the nfvPPA-PSP group, while greater gray matter atrophy and a trend toward greater sentence comprehension deficits (median [IQR] sentence comprehension correct: nfvPPA-PSP, 98% [80-100]; nfvPPA-CBD, 81% [65-98]; P = .08) were found in the nfvPPA-CBD group. At follow-up after 1 year, we observed no significant differences in any speech or language measures. Furthermore, atrophy in patients with PSP progressed within the subcortical/brainstem motor system generating greater oculomotors deficits and swallowing difficulty; atrophy in patients with CBD spread anteriorly in prefrontal regions consistent with their greater working memory impairment and development of behavioral symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients presenting with nfvPPA, presence of early severe dysarthria, relatively selective white matter atrophy at presentation, and a greater rate of change in the brainstem measured by longitudinal imagingmay be useful for differentiating underlying PSP from CBD pathology during life.",,62,1,NIH,09-11410 DHS/ADP/ARCC,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2016-06-01

We systematically investigated the presence and extent of the AD-related cytoskeletal pathology in serial thick tissue sections through all subcortical brain nuclei that send efferent projections to the transentorhinal and entorhinal regions in three individuals with Braak and Braak AD stage 0 cortical cytoskeletal pathology and fourteen individuals with Braak and Braak AD stage I cortical cytoskeletal pathology by means of immunostainings with the anti-tau antibody AT8. These investigations revealed consistent AT8 immunoreactive tau cytoskeletal pathology in a subset of these subcortical nuclei in the Braak and Braak AD stage 0 individuals and in all of these subcortical nuclei in the Braak and Braak AD stage I individuals. The widespread affection of the subcortical nuclei in Braak and Braak AD stage I shows that the extent of the early subcortical tau cytoskeletal pathology has been considerably underestimated previously. In addition, our novel findings support the concept that subcortical nuclei become already affected during an early 'pre-cortical' evolutional phase before the first AD-related cytoskeletal changes occur in the mediobasal temporal lobe (i.e. allocortical transentorhinal and entorhinal regions). The very early involved subcortical brain regions may represent the origin of the AD-related tau cytoskeletal pathology, from where the neuronal cytoskeletal pathology takes an ascending course toward the secondarily affected allocortex and spreads transneuronally along anatomical pathways in predictable sequences.",allocortex | Alzheimer's disease | cytoskeletal pathology | entorhinal region | prion-like diseases | subcortical nuclei | tau protein,63,1,NIH,P50AG023501,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2016-05-01

It is also present in a subset of Alzheimer's disease cases. Recently, few reports showed TDP-43 changes in cognitively normal elderly. In Caucasians, TDP-43 proteinopathy independently correlate with cognitive decline. However, it is challenging to establish direct links between cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric symptoms and protein inclusions in neurodegenerative diseases because individual cognitive reserves modify the threshold for clinical disease expression. Cognitive reserve is influenced by demographic, environmental and genetic factors. We investigated the relationships between demographic, clinical and neuropathological variables and TDP-43 proteinopathy in a large multiethnic sample of cognitively normal elderly. TDP-43 proteinopathy was identified in 10.5%, independently associated with older age (P = 0.03) and Asian ethnicity (P = 0.002). Asians showed a higher prevalence of TDP-43 proteinopathy than Caucasians, even after adjustment for sex, age, Braak stage and schooling (odds ratio = 3.50, confidence interval 1.41-8.69, P = 0.007). These findings suggested that Asian older adults may be protected from the clinical manifestation of brain TDP-43 proteinopathy.

In particular, 10 miRNA CpG sites that were found to be hypermethylated in AD compared to control brains represent transcripts that have been previously associated with the disease. This miRNA set is predicted to target 33 coding genes from the neuregulin receptor complex (ErbB) signaling pathway, which is required for the neurons myelination process. For 6 of these miRNA genes (MIR9-1, MIR9-3, MIR181C, MIR124-1, MIR146B, and MIR451), the hypermethylation pattern is in agreement with previous results from literature that shows downregulation of miR-9, miR-181c, miR-124, miR-146b, and miR-451 in the AD brain.

Methods: We included 76 probands diagnosed with behavioral-variant FTD (n=55), semantic-variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) (n=11), or nonfluent-variant PPA (n=10). Twenty-five percent of the cohort had at least 1 relative affected with FTD. Results: Mutations in GRN were identified in 7 probands, and in MAPT, in 2 probands.

characterized feature of the aging brain. Its etiology is uncertain, but its presence is sufficiently ubiquitous to merit further characterization and classification, which may stimulate clinicopathological studies and research into its pathobiology. This paper aims to harmonize evaluation and nomenclature of aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), a term that refers to a morphological spectrum of astroglial pathology detected by tau immunohistochemistry, especially with phosphorylation-dependent and 4R isoform-specific antibodies. ARTAG occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in individuals over 60 years of age. Tau-immunoreactive astrocytes in ARTAG include thorn-shaped astrocytes at the glia limitans and in white matter, as well as solitary or clustered astrocytes with perinuclear cytoplasmic tau immunoreactivity that extends into the astroglial processes as fine fibrillar or granular immunopositivity, typically in gray matter. Various forms of ARTAG may coexist in the same brain and might reflect different pathogenic processes. Based on morphology and anatomical distribution, ARTAG can be distinguished from primary tauopathies, but may be concurrent with primary tauopathies or other disorders. We recommend four steps for evaluation of ARTAG: (1) identification of five types based on the location of either morphologies of tau astrogliopathy: subpial, subependymal, perivascular, white matter, gray matter; (2) documentation of the regional involvement: medial temporal lobe, lobar (frontal, parietal, occipital, lateral temporal), subcortical, brainstem; (3) documentation of the severity of tau astrogliopathy; and (4) description of subregional involvement. Some types of ARTAG may underlie neurological symptoms; however, the clinical significance of ARTAG is currently uncertain and awaits further studies. The goal of this proposal is to raise awareness of astroglial tau pathology in the aged brain, facilitating communication among neuropathologists and researchers, and informing interpretation of clinical biomarkers and imaging studies that focus on tau-related indicators.",Aging | ARTAG | Tau | Tau astrogliopathy,228,0,NIH,P30AG008051-26,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2016-01-01

Despite several decades of intensive research, there is still little that can be done to prevent, cure, or even slow down the progression of NDs in most patients. There is an urgent need to develop new lines of basic and applied research that can be quickly translated into clinical application. One way to do this is to apply the tools of proteomics to well-characterized samples of human brain tissue, but a closer partnership must still be forged between proteomic scientists, brain banks, and clinicians to explore the maximum potential of this approach.

We report here that multiple system atrophy (MSA) is caused by a different human prion composed of the α-synuclein protein. MSA is a slowly evolving disorder characterized by progressive loss of autonomic nervous system function and often signs of parkinsonism; the neuropathological hallmark of MSA is glial cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of filaments of α-synuclein. To determine whether human α-synuclein forms prions, we examined 14 human brain homogenates for transmission to cultured human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing full-length, mutant human α-synuclein fused to yellow fluorescent protein (α-syn140∗A53T-YFP) and TgM83+/- mice expressing α-synuclein (A53T). The TgM83+/- mice that were hemizygous for the mutant transgene did not develop spontaneous illness; in contrast, the TgM83+/+ mice that were homozygous developed neurological dysfunction. Brain extracts from 14 MSA cases all transmitted neurodegeneration to TgM83+/- mice after incubation periods of ∼120 d, which was accompanied by deposition of α-synuclein within neuronal cell bodies and axons. All of the MSA extracts also induced aggregation of α-syn∗A53T-YFP in cultured cells, whereas none of six Parkinson's disease (PD) extracts or a control sample did so. Our findings argue that MSA is caused by a unique strain of α-synuclein prions, which is different from the putative prions causing PD and from those causing spontaneous neurodegeneration in TgM83+/+ mice. Remarkably, α-synuclein is the first new human prion to be identified, to our knowledge, since the discovery a half century ago that CJD was transmissible.",Neurodegeneration | Parkinson's disease | Strains | Synucleinopathies,392,1,NIA,AG021601,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2015-09-01

However, the brain comprises over 100 billion highly specialized cells, and it is a challenge to discriminate different cell groups for analyses. Isolating intact neurons is not feasible with traditional methods, such as tissue homogenization techniques. The advent of laser microdissection techniques promises to overcome previous limitations in the isolation of specific cells. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for isolating and analyzing neurons from postmortem human brain tissue samples. We describe a workflow for successfully freezing, sectioning and staining tissue for laser microdissection. This protocol was validated by mass spectrometric analysis. Isolated neurons can also be employed for western blotting or PCR. This protocol will enable further examinations of brain cell-specific molecular pathways and aid in elucidating distinct brain functions.",Brain | Laser microdissection | Neurons | Substantia nigra,13,0,NIA,R01AG040311,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2015-07-01

The factors related to morphometric brain changes in cognitively normal aging remain unknown. We aimed to identify which clinical factors are associated with morphometric brain changes in cognitively normal aging. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 414 subjects, ≥50 years old submitted to clinical assessment and brain autopsy, after informed consent, was carried out at the São Paulo Autopsy Service, Brazil. Data on cognitive and functional evaluations were collected through structured interview applied to the next-of-kin. Brain weight (g) and volume (mL) measurements were obtained and adjusted for head circumference (cm). Associations between brain weight/volume and related factors were obtained through univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: Participants were predominantly male (60.4%), Caucasian (69%), with mean age of 67.1 ± 10.9 years. Mean brain weight was 1219.2 ± 140.9 g, and mean brain volume was 1217.1 ± 152.3 mL. Head circumference was independently associated with low brain weight (p<0.001) and volume (p<0.001). Total and adjusted brain weight and volume decreased in some conditions. Female gender (p<0.001), hypertension (p<0.009), coronary artery disease (p<0.013) and walking assistance (p<0.011) were associated with lower adjusted brain weight while schooling was associated with higher adjusted brain weight (p<0.003). Female gender (p<0.001), age (p<0.001) and hypertension (p<0.011) were associated with low adjusted brain volume. Conclusion: Morphometric brain changes occur despite the absence of cognitive impairment and were predominantly associated with age, female gender, mobility impairment and cardiovascular conditions.

He also considered the possibility of a senile presentation of this disease subtype, which was described by Oskar Fischer a short time later.

The IC constitutes a phylogenetically conserved subcortical system including the locus coeruleus in pons, dorsal raphe nucleus, and substantia nigra in the midbrain, and nucleus basalis of Meynert in basal forebrain. Through their ascending projections to the cortex, the IC neurons regulate homeostasis and behavior by synthesizing aminergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters. Here we reviewed the evidence demonstrating that neurons of the IC system show neurofibrillary tangles in the earliest stages of AD, prior to cortical pathology, and how this involvement may explain pre-amnestic symptoms, including depression, agitation, and sleep disturbances in AD patients. In fact, clinical and animal studies show a significant reduction of AD cognitive and behavioral symptoms following replenishment of neurotransmitters associated with the IC network.

Altered levels of the NMDA receptor co-agonist, d-serine, have been associated with neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and epilepsy. However, whether d-serine levels are deregulated in AD remains elusive. Here, we first measured D-serine levels in post-mortem hippocampal and cortical samples from nondemented subjects (n=8) and AD patients (n=14). We next determined d-serine levels in experimental models of AD, including wild-type rats and mice that received intracerebroventricular injections of amyloid-β oligomers, and APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Finally, we assessed d-serine levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 21 patients with a diagnosis of probable AD, as compared with patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus (n=9), major depression (n=9) and healthy controls (n=10), and results were contrasted with CSF amyloid-β/tau AD biomarkers. d-serine levels were higher in the hippocampus and parietal cortex of AD patients than in control subjects. Levels of both d-serine and serine racemase, the enzyme responsible for d-serine production, were elevated in experimental models of AD. Significantly, d-serine levels were higher in the CSF of probable AD patients than in non-cognitively impaired subject groups. Combining d-serine levels to the amyloid/tau index remarkably increased the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of probable AD in our cohort. Our results show that increased brain and CSF d-serine levels are associated with AD.

The value of these features in predicting underlying AD pathology in individual patients is unknown. The goal of this study is to evaluate the utility of modified clinical criteria and visual interpretations of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for predicting amyloid deposition (as a surrogate of Alzheimer' s disease neuropathology) in patients presenting with CBS. Methods: In total, 25 patients meeting CBS core criteria underwent amyloid (Pittsburgh compound B; PIB) PET scans. Clinical records, MRI, and FDG scans were reviewed blinded to PIB results. Modified clinical criteria were used to classify CBS patients as temporoparietal variant CBS (tpvCBS) or frontal variant CBS (fvCBS). MRI and FDG-PET were classified based on the predominant atrophy/hypometabolism pattern (frontal or temporoparietal). Results: A total of 9 out of 13 patients classified as tpvCBS were PIB+, compared to 2out of 12 patients classified as fvCBS (P < 0.01, sensitivity 82%, specificity 71% for PIB+ status). Visual MRI reads had 73% sensitivity and 46% specificity for PIB+ status with moderate intra-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa = 0.42). Visual FDG reads had higher sensitivity (91%) for PIB+ status with perfect intra-rater reliability (kappa = 1.00), though specificity was low (50%). PIB results were confirmed in all 8 patients with available histopathology (3 PIB+ with confirmed AD, 5 PIB- with FTLD).

Such dysfunctions can lead to antisocial and criminal behavior that appears for the first time in the adult or middle-aged individual or even later in life. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency and type of criminal behavior among patients with a diagnosed dementing disorder. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 2397 patients who were seen at the University of California, San Francisco, Memory and Aging Center between 1999 and 2012, including 545 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), 171 patients with behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 89 patients with semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia, and 30 patients with Huntington disease. Patient notes containing specific keywords denoting criminal behavior were reviewed. Data were stratified by criminal behavior type and diagnostic groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frequencies of criminal behavior and χ2 statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 2397 patients studied, 204 (8.5%) had a history of criminal behavior that emerged during their illness. Of the major diagnostic groups, 42 of 545 patients (7.7%) with AD, 64 of 171 patients (37.4%) with bvFTD, 24 of 89 patients (27.0%) with semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia, and 6 of 30 patients (20%) with Huntington disease exhibited criminal behavior. A total of 14% of patients with bvFTD were statistically significantly more likely to present with criminal behavior compared with 2% of patients with AD (P < .001) and 6.4% were statistically significantly more likely to exhibit violence compared with 2% of patients with AD (P = .003). Common manifestations of criminal behavior in the bvFTD group included theft, traffic violations, sexual advances, trespassing, and public urination in contrast with those in the AD group, who commonly committed traffic violations, often related to cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Criminal behavior is more common in patients with bvFTD and semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia than in those with AD and is more likely to be an early manifestation of the disorder. Judicial evaluations of criminality in the demented individual might require different criteria than the classic ""insanity defense"" used in the American legal system; these individuals should be treated differently by the law. The appearance of new-onset criminal behavior in an adult should elicit a search for frontal and anterior temporal brain disease and for dementing disorders.",,68,1,NIA,AG023501,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2015-03-01

Despite several studies about brainstem pathologies in PD and DLB, there is currently no detailed information available regarding the presence of alpha-synuclein immunoreactive inclusions (i) in the cranial nerve, precerebellar, vestibular and oculomotor brainstem nuclei and (ii) in brainstem fiber tracts and oligodendroctyes. Therefore, we analyzed the inclusion pathologies in the brainstem nuclei (Lewy bodies, LB; Lewy neurites, LN; coiled bodies, CB) and fiber tracts (LN, CB) of PD and DLB patients. As reported in previous studies, LB and LN were most prevalent in the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, pedunculopontine and raphe nuclei, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, parabrachial nuclei, reticular formation, prepositus hypoglossal, dorsal motor vagal and solitary nuclei. Additionally we were able to demonstrate LB and LN in all cranial nerve nuclei, premotor oculomotor, precerebellar and vestibular brainstem nuclei, as well as LN in all brainstem fiber tracts. CB were present in nearly all brainstem nuclei and brainstem fiber tracts containing LB and/or LN. These findings can contribute to a large variety of less well-explained PD and DLB symptoms (eg, gait and postural instability, impaired balance and postural reflexes, falls, ingestive and oculomotor dysfunctions) and point to the occurrence of disturbances of intra-axonal transport processes and transneuronal spread of the underlying pathological processes of PD and DLB along anatomical pathways.",alpha-synuclein | brainstem | dementia with Lewy bodies | Parkinson's disease | prion-like disease,133,0,NIH,R01AG040311,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2015-03-01

The description of this rare Alzheimer's disease phenotype has been limited to case reports and small series, and many clinical, neuroimaging and neuropathological characteristics are not well understood. In this retrospective study, we included 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease with a behavioural-predominant presentation (behavioural Alzheimer's disease) and a neuropathological diagnosis of high-likelihood Alzheimer's disease (n = 17) and/or biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology (n = 44). In addition, we included 29 patients with autopsy/biomarker-defined Alzheimer's disease with a dysexecutive-predominant syndrome (dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease). We performed structured chart reviews to ascertain clinical features. First symptoms were more often cognitive (behavioural Alzheimer's disease: 53%; dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease: 83%) than behavioural (behavioural Alzheimer's disease: 25%; dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease: 3%). Apathy was the most common behavioural feature, while hyperorality and perseverative/compulsive behaviours were less prevalent. Fifty-two per cent of patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease met diagnostic criteria for possible behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia. Overlap between behavioural and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease was modest (9/75 patients). Sixty per cent of patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease and 40% of those with the dysexecutive syndrome carried at least one APOE ε4 allele. We also compared neuropsychological test performance and brain atrophy (applying voxel-based morphometry) with matched autopsy/biomarker-defined typical (amnestic-predominant) Alzheimer's disease (typical Alzheimer's disease, n = 58), autopsy-confirmed/Alzheimer's disease biomarker-negative behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (n = 59), and controls (n = 61). Patients with behavioural Alzheimer's disease showed worse memory scores than behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and did not differ from typical Alzheimer's disease, while executive function composite scores were lower compared to behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia and typical Alzheimer's disease. Voxel-wise contrasts between behavioural and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease patients and controls revealed marked atrophy in bilateral temporoparietal regions and only limited atrophy in the frontal cortex. In direct comparison with behavioural and those with dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease, patients with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia showed more frontal atrophy and less posterior involvement, whereas patients with typical Alzheimer's disease were slightly more affected posteriorly and showed less frontal atrophy (P < 0.001 uncorrected). Among 24 autopsied behavioural Alzheimer's disease/dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease patients, only two had primary co-morbid FTD-spectrum pathology (progressive supranuclear palsy). In conclusion, behavioural Alzheimer's disease presentations are characterized by a milder and more restricted behavioural profile than in behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, co-occurrence of memory dysfunction and high APOE ε4 prevalence. Dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease presented as a primarily cognitive phenotype with minimal behavioural abnormalities and intermediate APOE ε4 prevalence. Both behavioural Alzheimer's disease and dysexecutive Alzheimer's disease presentations are distinguished by temporoparietal-predominant atrophy. Based on the relative sparing of frontal grey matter, we propose to redefine these clinical syndromes as 'the behavioural/dysexecutive variant of Alzheimer's disease' rather than frontal variant Alzheimer's disease. Further work is needed to determine whether behavioural and dysexecutive-predominant presentations of Alzheimer's disease represent distinct phenotypes or a single continuum.","Alzheimer's disease | executive function | frontal, behaviour | frontotemporal dementia",221,1,NIA,K23AG045289,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2015-01-01

A variety of thresholds have been applied in the literature to define Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography positivity, but the ability of these thresholds to detect early amyloid-β deposition is unknown, and validation studies comparing Pittsburgh compound-B thresholds to post-mortem amyloid burden are lacking. In this study we first derived thresholds for amyloid positron emission tomography positivity using Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography in 154 cognitively normal older adults with four complementary approaches: (i) reference values from a young control group aged between 20 and 30 years; (ii) a Gaussian mixture model that assigned each subject a probability of being amyloid-β-positive or amyloid-β-negative based on Pittsburgh compound-B index uptake; (iii) a k-means cluster approach that clustered subjects into amyloid-β-positive or amyloid-β-negative based on Pittsburgh compound-B uptake in different brain regions (features); and (iv) an iterative voxel-based analysis that further explored the spatial pattern of early amyloid-β positron emission tomography signal. Next, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the derived thresholds in 50 individuals who underwent Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography during life and brain autopsy (mean time positron emission tomography to autopsy 3.1 ± 1.8 years). Amyloid at autopsy was classified using Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria, unadjusted for age. The analytic approaches yielded low thresholds (standard uptake value ratio<inf>low</inf> = 1.21, distribution volume ratio<inf>low</inf> = 1.08) that represent the earliest detectable Pittsburgh compound-B signal, as well as high thresholds (standard uptake value ratio<inf>high</inf> = 1.40, distribution volume ratio<inf>high</inf> = 1.20) that are more conservative in defining Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography positivity. In voxel-wise contrasts, elevated Pittsburgh compound-B retention was first noted in the medial frontal cortex, then the precuneus, lateral frontal and parietal lobes, and finally the lateral temporal lobe. When compared to post-mortem amyloid burden, low proposed thresholds were more sensitive than high thresholds (sensitivities: distribution volume ratio<inf>low</inf> 81.0%, standard uptake value ratio<inf>low</inf> 83.3%; distribution volume ratio<inf>high</inf> 61.9%, standard uptake value ratio<inf>high</inf> 62.5%) for CERAD moderate-to-frequent neuritic plaques, with similar specificity (distribution volume ratio<inf>low</inf> 95.8%; standard uptake value ratio<inf>low</inf>, distribution volume ratio<inf>high</inf> and standard uptake value ratio<inf>high</inf> 100.0%). A receiver operator characteristic analysis identified optimal distribution volume ratio (1.06) and standard uptake value ratio (1.20) thresholds that were nearly identical to the a priori distribution volume ratio<inf>low</inf> and standard uptake value ratio<inf>low</inf>. In summary, we found that frequently applied thresholds for Pittsburgh compound-B positivity (typically at or above distribution volume ratio<inf>high</inf> and standard uptake value ratio<inf>high</inf>) are overly stringent in defining amyloid positivity.

Method: Seventeen patients with pathologically proven frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) associated with C9ORF72 mutations were identified from Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank. Of the 17 cases with C9ORF72 mutation, 4 exhibited well-defined delusions. The clinical history, neurological examination, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging analysis, and postmortem assessment of the patients with delusions were evaluated and compared with the other cases. Result: The content of the delusions was mixed including persecution, infidelity, and grandiosity. All cases showed parkinsonism; voxel-based morphometry analysis showed greater precuneus atrophy in patients with delusions than those without delusions. All 4 had unclassifiable FTLD with TAR DNA-binding protein inclusions, with characteristics of both type A and type B. Three cases had additional t pathology and another had a-synuclein pathology. Conclusion: C9ORF72 carriers with well-defined delusions likely associated with additional pathologies and parietal atrophy in neuroimaging.

Alzheimer described the clinical picture of Arteriosclerotic atrophy of the brain, differentiating it from other similar disorders. He stated that autopsy allowed pathological distinction between arteriosclerosis and syphilis, thereby achieving some of his objectives of segregating disorders and separating them from syphilis. His studies contributed greatly to establishing the key information on vascular brain diseases, predating the present state of knowledge on the issue, while providing early descriptions of what would be later regarded as the dimensional presentation of the now called “Vascular cognitive impairment”, constituted by a spectrum that includes a stage of “Vascular cognitive impairment not dementia” and another of “Vascular dementia”.",Alzheimer | Arteriosclerosis | Arteriosclerotic atrophy of the brain | Brain vascular disease | Syphilis,4,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,5,2015-01-01

Many autopsy studies have reported brains with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are indistinguishable from those of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), in the absence of amyloid (Aβ) plaques. For these “NFT+/Aβ−” brains, for which formal criteria for AD neuropathologic changes are not met, the NFTs are mostly restricted to structures in the medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, brainstem, and olfactory areas (bulb and cortex). Symptoms in persons with PART usually range from normal to amnestic cognitive changes, with only a minority exhibiting profound impairment. Because cognitive impairment is often mild, existing clinicopathologic designations, such as “tangle-only dementia” and “tangle-predominant senile dementia”, are imprecise and not appropriate for most subjects. PART is almost universally detectable at autopsy among elderly individuals, yet this pathological process cannot be specifically identified pre-mortem at the present time. Improved biomarkers and tau imaging may enable diagnosis of PART in clinical settings in the future. Indeed, recent studies have identified a common biomarker profile consisting of temporal lobe atrophy and tauopathy without evidence of Aβ accumulation. For both researchers and clinicians, a revised nomenclature will raise awareness of this extremely common pathologic change while providing a conceptual foundation for future studies.

Which might be the neural bases for these behavioral differences? The number of cells in olfactory regions, and especially the number of neurons, may represent a more accurate indicator of the neural machinery than volume or weight, but besides gross volume measures of the human olfactory bulb, no systematic study of sex differences in the absolute number of cells has yet been undertaken. In this work, we investigate a possible sexual dimorphism in the olfactory bulb, by quantifying postmortem material from 7 men and 11 women (ages 55-94 years) with the isotropic fractionator, an unbiased and accurate method to estimate absolute cell numbers in brain regions. Female bulbs weighed 0.132 g in average, while male bulbs weighed 0.137 g, a non-significant difference; however, the total number of cells was 16.2 million in females, and 9.2 million in males, a significant difference of 43.2%. The number of neurons in females reached 6.9 million, being no more than 3.5 million in males, a difference of 49.3%. The number of non-neuronal cells also proved higher in women than in men: 9.3 million and 5.7 million, respectively, a significant difference of 38.7%. The same differences remained when corrected for mass. Results demonstrate a sex-related difference in the absolute number of total, neuronal and non-neuronal cells, favoring women by 40-50%. It is conceivable that these differences in quantitative cellularity may have functional impact, albeit difficult to infer how exactly this would be, without knowing the specific circuits cells make. However, the reported advantage of women as compared to men may stimulate future work on sex dimorphism of synaptic microcircuitry in the olfactory bulb.",,61,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2014-11-01

However, there is a lack of studies that systematically assess those biological processes in patients with AD neuropathology but with no evidence of cognitive impairment. We evaluated markers of oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG, H2AX), DNA repair (p53, BRCA1, PTEN), and cell-cycle (Cdk1, Cdk4, Cdk5, Cyclin B1, Cyclin D1, p27Kip1, phospho-Rb and E2F1) through immunohistochemistry and cell death through TUNEL in autopsy hippocampal tissue samples arrayed in a tissue microarray (TMA) composed of three groups: I) ""clinical-pathological AD"" (CP-AD) - subjects with neuropathological AD (Braak≥IV and CERAD = B or C) and clinical dementia (CDR≥2, IQCODE.3.8); II) ""pathological AD"" (P-AD) - subjects with neuropathological AD (Braak≥IV and CERAD = B or C) and without cognitive impairment (CDR 0, IQCODE<3.2); and III) ""normal aging"" (N) - subjects without neuropathological AD (Braak≤II and CERAD 0 or A) and with normal cognitive function (CDR 0, IQCODE<3.2).

However, significant reductions in DNA repair and cell-cycle inhibition markers and increases in cell-cycle progression and cell death markers in subjects with CP-AD were detected when compared to both P-AD and N groups, whereas there were no significant differences in the studied markers between P-AD individuals and N subjects. This study indicates that, even in the setting of pathological AD, healthy cognition may be associated with a preserved repair to DNA damage, cell-cycle regulation, and cell death in post-mitotic neurons. © 2014 Silva et al.",,57,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2014-06-01

This failure may relate to an oversimplification of the pathogenic processes underlying AD and also lack of understanding of AD progression during its long latent stages. Although evidence shows that the two specific neuropathological hallmarks in AD (neuronal loss and protein accumulation), which are opposite in nature, do not progress in parallel, the great majority of studies have focused on only one of these aspects. Furthermore, research focusing on single structures is likely to render an incomplete picture of AD pathogenesis because as AD involves complete brain networks, potential compensatory mechanisms within the network may ameliorate impairment of the system to a certain extent. Here, we describe an approach for enabling integrative analysis of the dual-nature lesions, simultaneously, in all components of one of the brain networks most vulnerable to AD. This approach is based on significant development of methods previously described mainly by our group that were optimized and complemented for this study. It combines unbiased stereology with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, making use of advanced graphics computing for three-dimensional (3D) volume reconstructions. Although this study was performed in human brainstem and focused in AD, it may be applied to the study of any neurological disease characterized by dual-nature lesions, in humans and animal models. This approach does not require a high level of investment in new equipment and a significant number of specimens can be processed and analyzed within a funding cycle. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",3D reconstruction | Alzheimer's disease | Brain network | Brainstem | Human | Immunohistochemistry | Neurodegenerative diseases | Neuropathology | Stereology,13,0,NIH,R01AG040311,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2014-04-01

Evidence from anatomical studies suggests that the nucleus subputaminalis (NSP), a subnucleus of the cholinergic basal forebrain, may be involved in the pathological process of PPA. Therefore, we studied the pattern of cortical and basal forebrain atrophy in 10 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PPA and 18 healthy age-matched controls using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We determined the cholinergic basal forebrain nuclei according to Mesulam's nomenclature and the NSP in MRI reference space based on histological sections and the MRI scan of a post-mortem brain in cranio. Using voxel-based analysis, we found left hemispheric cortical atrophy in PPA patients compared with controls, including prefrontal, lateral temporal and medial temporal lobe areas. We detected cholinergic basal forebrain atrophy in left predominant localizations of Ch4p, Ch4am, Ch4al, Ch3 and NSP. For the first time, we have described the pattern of basal forebrain atrophy in PPA and confirmed the involvement of NSP that had been predicted based on theoretical considerations. Our findings may enhance understanding of the role of cholinergic degeneration for the regional specificity of the cortical destruction leading to the syndrome of PPA. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Cholinergic system | Diagnosis | Language | Nucleus subputaminalis | Post-mortem MRI | Primary progressive aphasia,16,0,NIA,R01AG040311,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2014-03-01

We investigated whether TMEM106B is also a genetic modifier of disease in carriers of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) expansions. We assessed the genotype of 325 C9ORF72 expansion carriers (cohort 1), 586 FTD patients lacking C9ORF72 expansions [with or without motor neuron disease (MND); cohort 2], and a total of 1,302 controls for TMEM106B variants (rs3173615 and rs1990622) using MassArray iPLEX and Taqman genotyping assays. For our primary analysis, we focused on functional variant rs3173615, and employed a recessive genotypic model. In cohort 1, patients with C9ORF72 expansions showed a significantly reduced frequency of carriers homozygous for the minor allele as compared to controls [11.9 vs. 19.1 %, odds ratio (OR) 0.57, p = 0.014; same direction as carriers of GRN mutations]. The strongest evidence was provided by FTD patients (OR 0.33, p = 0.009) followed by FTD/MND patients (OR 0.38, p = 0.017), whereas no significant difference was observed in MND patients (OR 0.85, p = 0.55). In cohort 2, the frequency of carriers homozygous for the minor allele was not significantly reduced in patients as compared to controls (OR 0.77, p = 0.079); however, a significant reduction was observed when focusing on those patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP; OR 0.26, p < 0.001). Our study identifies TMEM106B as the first genetic factor modifying disease presentation in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Homozygosity for the minor allele protects carriers from developing FTD, but not from developing MND; similar effects are seen in FTLD-TDP patients with yet unknown genetic causes. These new findings show that the protective effects of TMEM106B are not confined to carriers of GRN mutations and might be relevant for prognostic testing, and as a promising therapeutic target for the entire spectrum of FTLD-TDP. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | C9ORF72 | Disease modifier | Frontotemporal dementia | Motor neuron disease | TMEM106B,94,0,NIH,P01AG017586,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2014-03-01

Hippocampus and BFCS volumes were determined from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans at 3 Tesla, and cortical amyloid load from AV45 (florbetapir) positron emission tomography scans. In receiver operating characteristics analyses, BFCS volume provided significantly more accurate classification into amyloid-negative and -positive categories than hippocampus volume. In contrast, hippocampus volume more accurately identified the diagnostic categories of AD, late and early MCI, and CN compared with whole and anterior BFCS volume, whereas posterior BFCS and hippocampus volumes yielded similar diagnostic accuracy. In logistic regression analysis, hippocampus and posterior BFCS volumes contributed significantly to discriminate MCI and AD from CN, but only BFCS volume predicted amyloid status.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 140 cognitively impaired patients (mean age 65.0 years, 46% primary b-amyloid (Ab) diagnosis, mean Mini-Mental State Examination 22.3) who underwent amyloid (Pittsburgh compound B [PiB]) PET as part of observational research studies and were evaluated clinically before and after the scan. One hundred thirty-four concurrently underwent fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. We assessed for changes between the pre- and post-PET clinical diagnosis (from Ab to non-Ab diagnosis or vice versa) and Alzheimer disease treatment plan. The association between PiB/FDG results and changes in management was evaluated using x2 and multivariate logistic regression. Postmortem diagnosis was available for 24 patients (17%). Results: Concordance between scan results and baseline diagnosis was high (PiB 84%, FDG 82%). The primary diagnosis changed after PET in 13/140 patients (9%) overall but in 5/13 (38%) patients considered pre-PET diagnostic dilemmas. When examined independently, discordant PiB and discordant FDG were both associated with diagnostic change (unadjusted p > 0.0001). However, when examined together in a multivariate logistic regression, only discordant PiB remained significant (adjusted p = 0.00013). Changes in treatment were associated with discordant PiB in patients with non-Ab diagnoses (adjusted p = 0.028), while FDG had no effect on therapy. Both PiB (96%) and FDG (91%) showed high agreement with autopsy diagnosis. Conclusions: PET had a moderate effect on clinical outcomes. Discordant PiB had a greater effect than discordant FDG, and influence on diagnosis was greater than on treatment. Prospective studies are needed to better characterize the clinical role of amyloid PET.© 2014 American Academy of Neurology.",,62,0,NIA,K23AG031861,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2014-01-01

Methods: We prospectively collected clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathologic data in 11 patients with sporadic nfvPPA with FTLD-tau (nfvPPA-tau, n5 9) or FTLD-transactive response DNA binding protein pathology of 43 kD type A (nfvPPA-TDP, n = 2). We analyzed patterns of cognitive and gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy at presentation in the whole group and in each pathologic subtype separately. We also considered longitudinal clinical data. Results: At first evaluation, regardless of pathologic FTLD subtype, apraxia of speech (AOS) was the most common cognitive feature and atrophy involved the left posterior frontal lobe. Each pathologic subtype showed few distinctive features. At presentation, patients with nfvPPA-tau presented with mild to moderate AOS, mixed dysarthria with prominent hypokinetic features, clear agrammatism, and atrophy in the GM of the left posterior frontal regions and in left frontal WM. While speech and language deficits were prominent early, within 3 years of symptom onset, all patients with nfvPPA-tau developed significant extrapyramidal motor signs. At presentation, patients with nfvPPA-TDP had severe AOS, dysarthria with spastic features, mild agrammatism, and atrophy in left posterior frontal GM only. Selective mutism occurred early, when general neurologic examination only showed mild decrease in finger dexterity in the right hand. Conclusions: Clinical features in sporadic nfvPPA caused by FTLD subtypes relate to neurodegeneration of GMandWMin frontal motor speech and language networks. We propose that earlyWM atrophy in nfvPPA is suggestive of FTLD-tau pathology while early selective GM loss might be indicative of FTLD-TDP.© 2014 American Academy of Neurology.",,33,0,NIA,K23AG042492,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2014-01-01

Currently, little is known about factors that could account for the phenotypic heterogeneity detected in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. In this study, we investigated 4 genes that could represent genetic modifiers: ataxin-2 (ATXN2), non-imprinted in Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 1 (NIPA1), survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1), and survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2). Assessment of these genes, in a unique cohort of 331 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 376 control subjects, revealed that intermediate repeat lengths in ATXN2 possibly act as disease modifier in C9ORF72 expansion carriers; no evidence was provided for a potential role of NIPA1, SMN1, or SMN2. The effects of intermediate ATXN2 repeats were most profound in probands with MND or FTD/MND (2.1% vs. 0% in control subjects, p= 0.013), whereas the frequency in probands with FTD was identical to control subjects. Though intermediate ATXN2 repeats were already known to be associated with MND risk, previous reports did not focus on individuals with clear pathogenic mutations, such as repeat expansions in C9ORF72. Based on our present findings, we postulate that intermediate ATXN2 repeat lengths may render C9ORF72 expansion carriers more susceptible to the development of MND; further studies are needed, however, to validate our findings. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | Ataxin-2 | ATXN2 | C9ORF72 | Disease modifier | Frontotemporal dementia | Motor neuron disease,66,0,NIH,P01AG017586,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,4,2014-01-01

Diagnostic accuracy of posterior NbM volume was superior to hippocampus volume in both groups, despite higher multicenter variability of the BFCS measurements.

We investigated the clinical correlates of elevated CSF NfL levels in FTD. Methods CSF NfL, amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ42), tau, and phosphorylated tau concentrations were compared in 47 normal controls (NC), 8 asymptomatic gene carriers (NC2) of FTD-causing mutations, and 79 FTD (45 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia [bvFTD], 18 progressive nonfluent aphasia [PNFA], 16 semantic dementia [SD]), 22 progressive supranuclear palsy, 50 Alzheimer disease, 6 Parkinson disease, and 17 corticobasal syndrome patients. Correlations between CSF analyte levels were performed with neuropsychological measures and the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes (CDRsb). Voxel-based morphometry of structural magnetic resonance images determined the relationship between brain volume and CSF NfL. Results Mean CSF NfL concentrations were higher in bvFTD, SD, and PNFA than other groups. NfL in NC2 was similar to NC. CSF NfL, but not other CSF measures, correlated with CDRsb and neuropsychological measures in FTD, but not in other diagnostic groups. Analyses in 2 independent FTD cohorts and a group of autopsy-verified or biomarker-enriched cases confirmed the larger group analysis. In FTD, gray and white matter volume negatively correlated with CSF NfL concentration, such that individuals with the highest NfL levels exhibited the most atrophy. Interpretation CSF NfL is elevated in symptomatic FTD and correlates with disease severity. This measurement may be a useful surrogate endpoint of disease severity in FTD clinical trials. Longitudinal studies of CSF NfL in FTD are warranted.

This has a great advantage compared to already existing methods as it allows for the first time (i) a combined enrichment of neuromelanin granules and synaptosomes and (ii) just minimal amounts of tissue necessary to enable donor specific analysis. Individual specimens were classified as control or diseased according to clinical evaluation and neuropathological examination. For the enrichment of synaptosomes and neuromelanin granules from the same tissue sample density gradient centrifugations using Percoll® and Iodixanol were performed. The purity of resulting fractions was checked by transmission electron microscopy. We were able to establish a reproducible and easy to handle protocol combining two different density gradient centrifugations: using an Iodixanol gradient neuromelanin granules were enriched and in parallel, from the same sample, a fraction of synaptosomes with high purity using a Percoll® gradient was obtained. Our subfractionation strategy will enable a subsequent in depth proteomic characterization of neurodegenerative processes in the substantia nigra pars compacta in patients with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies compared to appropriate controls. Biological significance: Key features of Parkinson's disease are the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, an associated loss of the brain pigment neuromelanin and a resulting impairment of the neuronal network. The accumulation of iron binding neuromelanin granules is age- and disease-dependent and disease specific alterations could affect the neuronal iron homeostasis leading to oxidative stress induced cell death.The focus of the described method is the analysis of neuromelanin granules as well as axonal cell-endings of nerve cells (synaptosomes) of individual donors (control and diseased). It is the basis for the identification of disease-relevant changes in the iron homeostasis and the generation of new insight into altered protein compositions or regulations which might lead to disturbed communications between nerve cells resulting in pathogenic processes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Density gradient | Neuromelanin | Parkinson's disease | Substantia nigra pars compacta | Synaptosomes,31,0,NIA,R01AG040311,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2013-12-01

Method: Brains from deceased individuals aged ≥50 years old were collected after the next of kin signed an informed consent form and provided information through standardized questionnaires. Post-mortem clinical diagnoses were established in consensus meetings, and only cases with moderate or severe dementia or without cognitive impairment were included in the analysis. Immunohistochemical neuropathological examinations were performed following the universally accepted guidelines. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was made when there were at least both a moderate density of neuritic plaques (Consortium to Establish a Register for Alzheimer's disease B or C) and Braak stage III for neurofibrillary tangle distribution. For the diagnosis of vascular dementia, at least three zones or strategic areas had to be affected by infarcts, lacunae, or microinfarcts. Results: From 1,291 subjects, 113 cases were classified as having moderate or severe dementia, and 972 cases were free of cognitive impairment. The neuropathological diagnoses of the dementia sub-group were Alzheimer's disease (35.4%), vascular dementia (21.2%), Alzheimer's disease plus vascular dementia (13.3%), and other causes of dementia (30.1%). Small-vessel disease, which alone was not considered sufficient for a vascular dementia diagnosis, was present in 38.9% of all of the dementia cases and in 16.8% of the group without cognitive impairment (odds ratio = 2.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.53-5.51), adjusted for age, sex, and education. Conclusions: The relatively high frequencies of vascular dementia and small-vessel disease in the dementia sub-group constitute relevant findings for public health initiatives because control of vascular risk factors could decrease the prevalence of dementia in developing countries. © 2013 CLINICS.",Alzheimer's disease | Cerebrovascular disease | Dementia | Post-mortem diagnosis | Prevalence | Vascular dementia,38,1,NIA,P50AG023501,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2013-09-01

Here we determine whether the white and gray matter of the prefrontal portion of the human cerebral cortex have similar or different cellular compositions relative to the rest of the cortical regions by applying the Isotropic Fractionator to analyze the distribution of neurons along the entire anteroposterior axis of the cortex, and its relationship with the degree of gyrification, number of neurons under the cortical surface, and other parameters. The prefrontal region shares with the remainder of the cerebral cortex (except for occipital cortex) the same relationship between cortical volume and number of neurons. In contrast, both occipital and prefrontal areas vary from other cortical areas in their connectivity through the white matter, with a systematic reduction of cortical connectivity through the white matter and an increase of the mean axon caliber along the anteroposterior axis. These two parameters explain local differences in the distribution of neurons underneath the cortical surface. We also show that local variations in cortical folding are neither a function of local numbers of neurons nor of cortical thickness, but correlate with properties of the white matter, and are best explained by the folding of the white matter surface. Our results suggest that the human cerebral cortex is divided in two zones (occipital and non-occipital) that differ in how neurons are distributed across their gray matter volume and in three zones (prefrontal, occipital, and non-occipital) that differ in how neurons are connected through the white matter. Thus, the human prefrontal cortex has the largest fraction of neuronal connectivity through the white matter and the smallest average axonal caliber in the white matter within the cortex, although its neuronal composition fits the pattern found for other, non-occipital areas. © 2013 Ribeiro, Ventura-Antunes, Gabi, Mota, Grinberg, Farfel, Ferretti-Rebustini, Leite, Filho and Herculano-Houzel.",Cortical expansion | Evolution | Human | Occipital cortex | Prefrontal cortex,44,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2013-09-01

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we included 675 individuals 50 years of age or older from the Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group. Cognitive abilities were evaluated through a structured interview with an informant at the time of autopsy, including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. Neuropathologic examinations were performed using immunohistochemistry and following internationally accepted criteria. Multivariate linear regression models were conducted to determine whether the association between cognitive abilities (measured by CDR sum of boxes) and years of education was independent of sociodemographic variables and neuropathologic indices, including neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, lacunar infarctions, small-vessel disease, and Lewy bodies. In addition, interaction models were used to examine whether education modified the relation between neuropathologic indices and cognition. Results: Mean education was 3.9 63.5 years. Formal education was associated with a lower CDR sum of boxes (b520.197; 95%confidence interval 20.343, 20.052; p 5 0.008), after adjustment for sociodemographic variables and neuropathologic indices. Furthermore, education modified the relationship of lacunar infarcts with cognitive abilities (p 5 0.04).

Results Depression was associated with female gender (odds ratio (OR) = 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28-2.71, p = 0.001), widowhood (OR = 1.54; 95% CI = 1.03-2.32, p = 0.04), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.15-2.26, p = 0.006), and smoking (OR = 2.03; 95% CI = 1.40-2.95, p < 0.001) after multivariate logistic regression analysis. Other CVRFD were not associated with the presence of depression. Conclusions In our cross-sectional study, sedentary individuals and smokers showed a higher chance of depression during lifetime.

Because hyperphosphorylation alone does not necessarily cause tau aggregation, other post-translational modifications have been recently explored. Tau acetylation promotes aggregation and inhibits tau's ability to stabilize microtubules. Recent studies have shown co-localization of acetylated and phosphorylated tau in AD and some 4R tauopathies. We developed a novel monoclonal antibody against acetylated tau at lysine residue 274, which recognizes both 3R and 4R tau, and used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to probe 22 cases, including AD and another eight familial or sporadic tauopathies. Acetylated tau was identified in all tauopathies except argyrophilic grain disease (AGD). AGD is an age-associated, common but atypical 4R tauopathy, not always associated with clinical progression. Pathologically, AGD is characterized by neuropil grains, pre-neurofibrillary tangles, and oligodendroglial coiled bodies, all recognized by phospho-tau antibodies. The lack of acetylated tau in these inclusions suggests that AGD represents a distinctive tauopathy. Our data converge with previous findings to raise the hypothesis that AGD could play a protective role against the spread of AD-related tau pathology. Tau acetylation as a key modification for the propagation tau toxicity deserves further investigation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Acetylation | Autopsy | Human | Immunohistochemistry | Pathology | Tau,68,0,NIH,P01AG019724,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2013-04-01

Amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles have been implicated either directly as disruptors of neural function, or indirectly by precipitating neuronal death and thus causing a reduction in neuronal number. Alternatively, the initial cognitive decline has been attributed to subtle intracellular events caused by amyloid-β oligomers, resulting in dementia after massive synaptic dysfunction followed by neuronal degeneration and death. To investigate whether Alzheimer's disease is associated with changes in the absolute cell numbers of ageing brains, we used the isotropic fractionator, a novel technique designed to determine the absolute cellular composition of brain regions. We investigated whether plaques and tangles are associated with neuronal loss, or whether it is dementia that relates to changes of absolute cell composition, by comparing cell numbers in brains of patients severely demented with those of asymptomatic individuals-both groups histopathologically diagnosed as Alzheimer's-and normal subjects with no pathological signs of the disease. We found a great reduction of neuronal numbers in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of demented patients with Alzheimer's disease, but not in asymptomatic subjects with Alzheimer's disease. We concluded that neuronal loss is associated with dementia and not the presence of plaques and tangles, which may explain why subjects with histopathological features of Alzheimer's disease can be asymptomatic; and exclude amyloid-β deposits as causes for the reduction of neuronal numbers in the brain. We found an increase of non-neuronal cell numbers in the cerebral cortex and subcortical white matter of demented patients with Alzheimer's disease when compared with asymptomatic subjects with Alzheimer's disease and control subjects, suggesting a reactive glial cell response in the former that may be related to the symptoms they present.",,92,1,NIA,R01AG040311,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2013-01-01

Given the association between systemic inflammation and other neurodegenerative processes, links between autoimmunity and FTD need to be explored. Objective: To describe the prevalence of systemic autoimmune disease in semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), a clinical cohort, and in progranulin (PGRN) mutation carriers compared with neurologically healthy normal controls (NC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) as dementia controls. Design Case control. Setting Academic medical centres. Participants 129 svPPA, 39 PGRN, 186 NC and 158 AD patients underwent chart review for autoimmune conditions. A large subset of svPPA, PGRN and NC cohorts underwent serum analysis for tumour necrosis factor α(TNF-α) levels. Outcome measures χ2 Comparison of autoimmune prevalence and follow-up logistic regression. Results: There was a significantly increased risk of autoimmune disorders clustered around inflammatory arthritides, cutaneous disorders and gastrointestinal conditions in the svPPA and PGRN cohorts. Elevated TNF-α levels were observed in svPPA and PGRN compared with NC. Conclusions: svPPA and PGRN are associated with increased prevalence of specific and related autoimmune diseases compared with NC and AD. These findings suggest a unique pattern of systemic inflammation in svPPA and PGRN and open new research avenues for understanding and treating disorders associated with underlying transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 aggregation.",,97,0,NIA,K23AG040127,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2013-01-01

To determine whether genetically determined African ancestry is associated with neuropathological changes commonly associated with dementia, we analyzed a population-based brain bank in the highly admixed city of São Paulo, Brazil. African ancestry was estimated through the use of previously described ancestry-informative markers. Risk of presence of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, small vessel disease, brain infarcts and Lewy bodies in subjects with significant African ancestry versus those without was determined. Results were adjusted for multiple environmental risk factors, demographic variables and apolipoprotein E genotype. African ancestry was inversely correlated with neuritic plaques (P0.03). Subjects with significant African ancestry (n112, 55.4%) showed lower prevalence of neuritic plaques in the univariate analysis (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.95, P0.01) and when adjusted for age, sex, APOE genotype and environmental risk factors (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.89, P0.02). There were no significant differences for the presence of other neuropathological alterations. We show for the first time, using genetically determined ancestry, that African ancestry may be highly protective of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology, functioning through either genetic variants or unknown environmental factors.

It is customary to consider Alzheimer's disease (AD) as the most common cause of dementia, followed by vascular dementia (VaD). This dichotomous view of a neurodegenerative disease as opposed to brain damage caused by extrinsic factors led to separate lines of research in these two entities. Indeed, accumulated data suggest that the two disorders have additive effects and probably interact; however it is still unknown to what degree. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have shown ""vascular"" risk factors to be associated with AD. Therefore, a clear distinction between AD and VaD cannot be made in most cases, and is furthermore unhelpful. In the absence of efficacious treatment for the neurodegenerative process, special attention must be given to the vascular component, even in patients with presumed mixed pathology. Symptomatic treatment of VaD and AD is similar, although the former is less effective. For prevention of dementia it is important to treat all factors aggressively, even in stroke survivors who do not show evidence of cognitive decline. In this review, we will give a clinical and pathological picture of the processes leading to VaD and discuss its interaction with AD. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Biomarkers | Cognitive impairment | Dementia | Diagnosis | Neuropathology | Stroke | Vascular,56,0,NIA,P50AG023501,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2012-11-01

Transcriptomic analyses provide an important approach to elucidating the pathogenesis of complex diseases like AD, helping to figure out both pre-clinical markers to identify susceptible patients and the early pathogenic mechanisms to serve as therapeutic targets. This study provides the gene expression profile of postmortem brain tissue from subjects with clinic-pathological AD (Braak IV, V, or V and CERAD B or C; and CDR ≥1), preclinical AD (Braak IV, V, or VI and CERAD B or C; and CDR = 0), and healthy older individuals (Braak ≤ II and CERAD 0 or A; and CDR = 0) in order to establish genes related to both AD neuropathology and clinical emergence of dementia. Based on differential gene expression, hierarchical clustering and network analysis, genes involved in energy metabolism, oxidative stress, DNA damage/repair, senescence, and transcriptional regulation were implicated with the neuropathology of AD; a transcriptional profile related to clinical manifestation of AD could not be detected with reliability using differential gene expression analysis, although genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and cell cycle seems to have a role revealed by gene classifier. In conclusion, the present data suggest gene expression profile changes secondary to the development of AD-related pathology and some genes that appear to be related to the clinical manifestation of dementia in subjects with significant AD pathology, making necessary further investigations to better understand these transcriptional findings on the pathogenesis and clinical emergence of AD. © 2012 Silva et al.",,25,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2012-11-01

Most common forms of VaD in the elderly brain are subcortical vascular encephalopathy, strategic infarct dementia, and the multi infarct encephalopathy. Hereditary forms of VaD are rare. Most common is the cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Sporadic forms of VaD are caused by degenerative vessel disorders such as atherosclerosis, small vessel disease (SVD) including small vessel arteriosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and lipohyalinosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Less frequently inflammatory vessel disorders and tumor-associated vessel lesions (e.g. angiocentric T-cell or angiotropic large cell lymphoma) can cause symptoms of dementia. Here, we review and discuss the impact of vessel disorders to distinct vascular brain tissue lesions and to the development of dementia in elderly individuals. The impact of coexisting neurodegenerative pathology in the elderly brain to VaD as well as the correlation between SVD and CAA expansion in the brain parenchyma with that of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related pathology is highlighted. We conclude that ""pure"" VaD is rare and most frequently caused by infarctions. However, there is a significant contribution of vascular lesions and vessel pathology to the development of dementia that may go beyond tissue damage due to vascular lesions. Insufficient blood blow and alterations of the perivascular drainage mechanisms of the brain may also lead to a reduced protein clearance from extracellular space and subsequent increase of proteins in the brain parenchyma, such as the amyloid β-protein, and foster, thereby, the development of AD-related neurodegeneration. As such, it seems to be important for clinical practice to consider treatment of potentially coexisting AD pathology in cognitively impaired patients with vascular lesions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Atherosclerosis | Cerebral amyloid angiopathy | Dementia | Neurodegeneration | Perivascular drainage | Small vessel disease,119,0,NIH,P50AG023501,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2012-11-01

Our protocol was designed to minimize limitations faced by previous initiatives, and to enable designbased neurostereological analyses. The Psy-BBBABSG first milestone is the collection of 10 36 brains. A final report was completed for 14 cases: 3 BDs, 4 major depressive disorders, 1 substance use disorder, 1 mood disorder NOS, 3 obsessive compulsive spectrum symptoms, 1 OCD and 1 schizophrenia. The majority were male (64%), and the average age at death was 67.2 ± 9.0 years. The average postmortem interval was 16 h. Three matched controls were collected. The pilot stage confirmed that the protocols are well fitted to reach our goals. Our unique autopsy source makes possible to collect a fairly number of high quality cases in a short time. Such a collection offers an additional to the international research community to advance the understanding on neuropsychiatric diseases. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Autopsy | Bipolar disorder | Brain banking | Neuropathology | Obsessive compulsive disorder | Postmortem | Psychiatry | Stereology,6,0,NIH,P50 AG23501,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2012-06-01

Methods: Patients meeting clinical criteria for AD (n = 62) and FTLD (n = 45) underwent PiB and FDG-PET. PiB scans were classified as positive or negative by 2 visual raters blinded to clinical diagnosis, and using a quantitative threshold derived from controls (n = 25). FDG scans were visually rated as consistent with AD or FTLD, and quantitatively classified based on the region of lowest metabolism relative to controls. Results: PiB visual reads had a higher sensitivity for AD (89.5% average between raters) than FDG visual reads (77.5%) with similar specificity (PiB 83%, FDG 84%). When scans were classified quantitatively, PiB had higher sensitivity (89% vs 73%) while FDG had higher specificity (83% vs 98%). On receiver operating characteristic analysis, areas under the curve for PiB (0.888) and FDG (0.910) were similar. Interrater agreement was higher for PiB (K= 0.96) than FDG (K= 0.72), as was agreement between visual and quantitative classification (PiB K= 0.88- 0.92; FDGK= 0.64-0.68). In patients with known histopathology, overall classification accuracy (2 visual and 1 quantitative classification per patient) was 97% for PiB (n=12 patients) and 87% for FDG (n = 10). Conclusions: PiB and FDG showed similar accuracy in discriminating AD and FTLD. PiB was more sensitive when interpreted qualitatively or quantitatively. FDG was more specific, but only when scans were classified quantitatively. PiB slightly outperformed FDG in patients with known histopathology.

We have previously found that laser phototherapy immunomodulates the response to focal brain damage. Following direct cortical cryogenic injury the effects of laser phototherapy on inflammation and repair was assessed after cryogenic injury (CI) to the central nervous system (CNS) of rats. The laser phototherapy was carried out with a 780 nm AlGaAs diode laser. The irradiation parameters were: power of 40 mW, beam area of 0.04 cm2, energy density of 3 J/cm2 (3 s) in two points (0.12 J per point). Two irradiations were performed at 3 h-intervals, in contact mode. Rats (20 non-irradiated - controls and 20 irradiated) were used. The wound healing in the CNS was followed in 6 h, 1, 7 and 14 days after the last irradiation. The size of the lesions, the neuron cell viability percentages and the amount of positive GFAP labeling were statistically compared by ANOVA complemented by Tukey's test (p < 0.05). The distribution of lymphocytes, leukocytes and macrophages were also analyzed. CI created focal lesions in the cortex represented by necrosis, edema, hemorrhage and inflammatory infiltrate. The most striking findings were: lased lesions showed smaller tissue loss than control lesions in 6 h. During the first 24 h the amount of viable neurons was significantly higher in the lased group. There was a remarkable increase in the amount of GFAP in the control group by 14 days. Moreover, the lesions of irradiated animals had fewer leukocytes and lymphocytes in the first 24 h than controls. Considering the experimental conditions of this study it was concluded that laser phototherapy exerts its effect in wound healing following CI by controlling the brain damage, preventing neuron death and severe astrogliosis that could indicate the possibility of a better clinical outcome. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The current review focuses on the progressive signature of brain changes throughout the different stages of AD. We integrate recent findings on changes in cortical gray matter volume, white matter fiber tracts, neuropathological alterations, and brain metabolism assessed with molecular positron emission tomography (PET). Neurofibrillary tangles accumulate first in transentorhinal and cholinergic brain areas, and 4-D maps of cortical volume changes show early progressive temporo-parietal cortical thinning. Findings from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for assessment fiber tract integrity show cortical disconnection in corresponding brain networks. Importantly, the developmental trajectory of brain changes is not uniform and may be modulated by several factors such as onset of disease mechanisms, risk-associated and protective genes, converging comorbidity, and individual brain reserve. There is a general agreement between in vivo brain maps of cortical atrophy and amyloid pathology assessed through PET, reminiscent of post mortem histopathology studies that paved the way in the staging of AD. The association between in vivo and post mortem findings will clarify the temporal dynamics of pathophysiological alterations in the development of preclinical AD. This will be important in designing effective treatments that target specific underlying disease AD mechanisms. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",AD | ADNI | Alzheimer's disease | Biological activity | Biological markers | Classification | Clinical trials | Computational | CSF | DBM | Diagnosis | Drug development | DTI | EADNI | Early detection | FDA | FMRI | MCI | Mild cognitive impairment | MRI | Multimodal | Neuroanatomy | Neuroimaging | Neuropathology | Pre-clinical | Pre-dementia | Pre-symptomatic | Prediction | Regulatory authorities | Staging | Tractography | VBM,53,0,NIH,P50AG016570,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2011-12-01

This was also true for PD, although the pathological hallmark of PD is degeneration of pigmented neurons of the brainstem's substantia nigra (SN). However, PD pathophysiology was explained by dopamine depletion in the telencephalic basal ganglia due to insufficiency and degeneration of the projection neurons located in SN. In a similar line of argumentation AD-and FTLD-related clinical deficits were exclusively explained by supratentorial allo-and neo-cortical laminar neuronal necrosis. Recent comprehensive studies in AD and PD early stages found considerable and unexpected involvement of brainstem nuclei, which could have the potential to profoundly change our present concepts on origin, spread, and early clinical diagnosis of these diseases. In contrast with PD and AD, few studies addressed brainstem involvement in the course of the different types of FTLD-TDP. Some of the results, including ours, disclosed a higher and more widespread pathology than anticipated. The present review will focus mainly on the impact of brainstem changes during the course of the most frequent NDs including PD, AD, and FTLD-TDP, with special emphasis on the need for more comprehensive research on FTLDs. © 2011 Grinberg, Rueb and Heinsen.","Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration | Brainstem | Dementia | Human | Neurodegenerative diseases | Parkinson's disease | Pathology",53,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,4,2011-12-01

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 2,014 older adults (> 70 years at death) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database with clinical diagnosis of normal cognition (made ≤ 1 year before death, n = 419) or AD (at >65 years, n = 1,595) and a postmortem neuropathologic examination evaluating AD pathology (neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques) and non-AD pathology (diffuse plaques, amyloid angiopathy, Lewy bodies, macrovascular disease, microvascular disease). We used adjusted logistic regression to analyze the relationship between clinical AD diagnosis and neuropathologic features, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (c statistic) to evaluate how precisely neuropathology differentiates between cognitive diagnoses, and an interaction to identify effect modification by age group. Results: In a model controlling for coexisting neuropathologic features, the relationship between clinical AD diagnosis and neurofibrillary tangles was significantly weaker with increasing age (p < 0.001 for interaction). The aggregate of all neuropathologic features more strongly differentiated people with clinical AD from those without in younger age groups (70-74 years: c statistic, 95% confidence interval: 0.93, 0.89-0.96; 75-84 years: 0.95, 0.87-0.95; <85 years: 0.83, 0.80- 0.87). Non-AD pathology significantly improved precision of differentiation across all age groups (p < 0.004). Conclusion: ClinicalADdiagnosis was more weakly associated with neurofibrillary tangles among the oldest old compared to younger age groups, possibly due to less accurate clinical diagnosis, better neurocompensation, or unaccounted pathology among the oldest old.

Access to post-mortem brain tissue of subjects who had BD offers an opportunity to investigate neurobiology and this approach has led to some progress, particularly, due to the availability of more sophisticated molecular and cellular biological methodologies and well characterized brain collections over the past decade. Here we review the findings of morphometric post-mortem studies in BD and interpret them in the context of a potential physiopathological mechanism involving oxidative stress and apoptosis. A review of the literature was conducted to identify post-mortem studies that investigated cellular changes such as number, density and size of neurons and glia, in brains of subjects with BD. We found decreased density of neurons and glia and decreased size of neurons in frontal and subcortical areas of the brain. Based on recent studies that found evidence of increased apoptosis and oxidative stress in BD, we hypothesize that the cell abnormalities described are due to an increase in the apoptotic process that can be triggered, through its intrinsic pathway, by the existence of an exacerbated production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative damage in the disease. © 2010 CINP.",Apoptosis | bipolar disorder | neuropathology | oxidative stress,60,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2011-09-01

Even less is known about alterations of cortical projecting fiber tracts associated with basal forebrain atrophy. In this study, we determined regional atrophy within the basal forebrain in 21 patients with AD and 16 subjects with MCI compared to 20 healthy elderly subjects using deformation-based morphometry of MRI scans. We assessed effects of basal forebrain atrophy on fiber tracts derived from high-resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using tract-based spatial statistics. We localized significant effects relative to a map of cholinergic nuclei in MRI standard space as determined from a postmortem brain. Patients with AD and MCI subjects showed reduced volumes in basal forebrain areas corresponding to anterior medial and lateral, intermediate and posterior nuclei of the Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) as well as in the diagonal band of Broca nuclei (P < 0.01). Effects in MCI subjects were spatially more restricted than in AD, but occurred at similar locations. The volume of the right antero-lateral NbM nucleus was correlated with intracortical projecting fiber tract integrity such as the corpus callosum, cingulate, and the superior longitudinal, inferior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital, and uncinate fasciculus (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). Our findings suggest that a multimodal MRI-DTI approach is supportive to determine atrophy of cholinergic nuclei and its effect on intracortical projecting fiber tracts in AD. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Basal forebrain | Cholinergic degeneration | Diffusion tensor imaging | Early diagnosis | Nucleus basalis meynert,82,0,NIA,R01AG040311,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2011-09-01

Such criteria would make it possible to perform large multicentre clinicopathological studies and, consequently, to better understand which, how, and where vascular brain lesions lead to cognitive decline, as it is possible to do in Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. However, a major obstacle in the standardization of diagnosis is the fact that vascular brain lesions are a large group comprising heterogeneous changes that have different pathogeneses. Although it is accepted that some kinds of vascular changes cause cognitive impairment, it is not uncommon to find reports of the assumed same histological changes in control subjects. An indispensable first step in the unequivocal establishment of neuropathological criteria is to uniform the definitions used for each one of the lesions, preferably based on its pathogenesis. In the present, non-standardized state of ambiguity, a given lesion is designated by different names between and within the clinical, radiological, and pathological settings, and several definitions simply overlap. Before attempting to create new criteria, a multidisciplinary group-task is urged to identify and minimize the uncontrolled proliferation of definitions. Only then, it will be possible to advance the understanding of how vascular brain changes affect cognition. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Pathogenetically, AS and SVD share similar mechanisms: plasma protein leakage into the vessel wall, accumulation of lipid-containing macrophages, and fibrosis of the vessel wall. CAA, on the other hand, is characterized by the deposition of the amyloid β-protein in the vessel wall. Despite these differences between CAA, AS and SVD, apolipoprotein E (apoE) is involved in all three disorders. Such a pathogenetic link may explain the correlations between AS, SVD, CAA, and Alzheimer's disease in the brains of elderly individuals reported in the literature. In addition, AS, SVD, and CAA can lead to tissue lesions such as hemorrhage and infarction. Moreover, intracerebral SVD leads to plasma protein leakage into the damaged vessel wall and into the perivascular space resulting in a blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. This SVD-related BBB dysfunction is considered to cause white matter lesions (WMLs) and lacunar infarcts. In this review, we demonstrate the relationship between AS, SVD, and CAA as well as their contribution to the development of vascular tissue lesions and we emphasize an important role for apoE in the pathogenesis of vessel disorders and vascular tissue lesions as well as for BBB dysfunction on WML and lacunar infarct development. © The Author(s) 2010.",Atherosclerosis | Brain infarction | Cerebral amyloid angiopathy | Hemorrhages | Small vessel disease | White matter lesions,204,1,DAAD,289/08,Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung,papers by authors,0,2010-03-01

The causes of the non-motor symptoms in PD are multifactorial and unlikely to be explained by single lesions. However, several evidence link them to damage of specific brainstem nuclei. Numerous brainstem nuclei are engaged in fundamental homeostatic mechanisms, including gastrointestinal regulation, pain perception, mood control, and sleep-wake cycles. In addition, these nuclei are locally interconnected in a complex manner and are subject to supraspinal control. The objective of this review is to provide a better overview of the current knowledge about the consequences of the involvement of specific brainstem nuclei to the most prevalent non-motor symptoms occurring in PD.

Objectives: To ascertain the sensitivity and specificity of postmortem diagnosis based on informant interview compared against the diagnosis established at a memory clinic. Methods: A prospective study was conducted at the BBBABSG and at the Reference Center for Cognitive Disorders (RCCD), a specialized memory clinic of the Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo Medical School. Control subjects and cognitively impaired subjects were referred from the Hospital das Clínicas to the RCCD where subjects and their informants were assessed. The same informant was then interviewed at the BBBABSG. Specialists' panel consensus, in each group, determined the final diagnosis of the case, blind to other center's diagnosis. Data was compared for frequency of diagnostic equivalence. For this study, the diagnosis established at the RCCD was accepted as the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity were computed. Results: Ninety individuals were included, 45 with dementia and 45 without dementia (26 cognitively normal and 19 cognitively impaired but non-demented). The informant interview at the BBBABSG had a sensitivity of 86.6% and specificity of 84.4% for the diagnosis of dementia, and a sensitivity of 65.3% and specificity of 93.7% for the diagnosis of normal cognition.

Methodological and ethical limitations have prevented this question to be elucidated. We want to introduce a protocol applying state-of-the-art methods in order to solve fundamental questions regarding the neuroimaging-neuropathological uncertainties comprising the most common white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] seen in aging. By this protocol, the correlation between signal features in in situ, post mortem MRI-derived methods, including DTI and MTR and quantitative and qualitative histopathology can be investigated. We are mainly interested in determining the precise neuroanatomical substrate of incipient WMHs. A major issue in this protocol is the exact co-registration of small lesion in a tridimensional coordinate system that compensates tissue deformations after histological processing. The protocol is based on four principles: post mortem MRI in situ performed in a short post mortem interval, minimal brain deformation during processing, thick serial histological sections and computer-assisted 3D reconstruction of the histological sections. This protocol will greatly facilitate a systematic study of the location, pathogenesis, clinical impact, prognosis and prevention of WMHs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Identification of proteins that physiologically bind Aβ and modulate its aggregation and neurotoxicity could lead to the development of novel disease-modifying approaches in AD. By screening a phage display peptide library for high affinity ligands of aggregated Aβ1-42, we isolated a peptide homologous to a highly conserved amino acid sequence present in the N-terminus of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). We show that purified human apoA-I and Aβ form non-covalent complexes and that interaction with apoA-I affects the morphology of amyloid aggregates formed by Aβ. Significantly, Aβ/apoA-I complexes were also detected in cerebrospinal fluid from AD patients. Interestingly, apoA-I and apoA-I-containing reconstituted high density lipoprotein particles protect hippocampal neuronal cultures from Aβ-induced oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. These results suggest that human apoA-I modulates Aβ aggregation and Aβ-induced neuronal damage and that the Aβ-binding domain in apoA-I may constitute a novel framework for the design of inhibitors of Aβ toxicity. © 2009.",Alzheimer's disease | Amyloid-β peptide | Human apolipoprotein A-I | Neurotoxicity,84,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2009-06-01

Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 ± 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells (""neurons"") and 84.6 ± 9.8 billion NeuN-negative (""nonneuronal"") cells. With only 19% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Brain size | Comparative neuroanatomy | Evolution | Glia/neuron ratio | Human | Neuron numbers,1033,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2009-04-01

Alterations of the cholinergic system have been described in aging and especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging reported reduced prefrontal metabolism and perfusion with maintained or even increased task performance during cholinergic stimulation in both young and older healthy people. Similar effects in patients with AD suggest that the cholinergic system remains responsive even in mild to moderate stages of the disease. Using specific ligands to muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and cholinesterase, PET studies found alterations of cholinergic neurotransmission in AD. Recently, structural magnetic resonance imaging has been employed to determine the morphological integrity of the basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei in vivo.

Methods: 603 subjects, who underwent autopsy, were classified regarding the presence of dementia, according to post mortem cognitive classification. Demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and anatomically-proven cardiovascular disease (myocardial hypertrophy, cerebral and carotid atherosclerosis) were compared among cognitively normal persons and individuals with dementia. Results: Cognitive deficit was associated with advanced age, stroke, physical inactivity and low body mass index (p<0.05). Circle of Willis atherosclerosis was greater in patients with dementia than in controls on univariate analysis (p=0.01). However, this association lost significance when adjusted by age and gender (p=0.61). Heart failure and anatomopathological cardiac parameters were more severe in the control group than in demented individuals (p<0.05). Carotid artery atherosclerosis and intima-media thickness were similar in both groups. Conclusion: Advanced age, stroke, physical inactivity and low body mass index were linked to dementia.

There is strong evidence that the progression of the phospho-tau neurofibrillary cytoskeletal changes, rather than the β-amyloid burden, is crucial in determining the severity of the dementia in AD. The Braak and Braak staging system (BB) focuses mainly on the cortical cytoskeletal pathology and classifies this progressive pathology into six stages, spreading from the transentorhinal region to primary cortices. Although it is reported elsewhere that the midbrain's dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), which is connected with those areas of the cerebral cortex undergoing early changes during BB I and II, exhibits AD-related cytoskeletal pathology, this nucleus has not been considered by the BB. Methods: To determine during which BB stage and how frequently the DR is affected by AD-related neurofibrillary changes, we studied the DR of 118 well-characterized individuals of the Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group categorized according to the BB. Thirty-eight of these individuals were staged as BB = 0, and 80 as BB ≥ 1. Results: In all of the BB ≥ 1 individuals (cortical neurofibrillary changes were present at least in the transentorhinal region) and in more than 1/5 of the BB = 0 individuals neurofibrillary changes were detected in the supratrochlear subnucleus of the DR. Conclusions: These observations: (i) support the hypothesis of transneuronal spread of neurofibrillary changes from the DR to its interconnected cortical brain areas; and (ii) indicate that the supratrochlear subnucleus of the DR is affected by neurofibrillary changes before the transentorhinal cortex during the disease process underlying AD. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Alzheimer's disease | Braak and braak staging | Brainstem | Cytoskeletal pathology | Raphe nuclei | Tau protein,150,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,4,2009-01-01

Solid malignancies may have a protracted presentation, and diagnosis frequently requires imaging and deep-sited biopsies; clinical and postmortem diagnosis discrepancies may occur in a high rate in these diseases. Here, we analyzed the occurrence of clinico-pathological discrepancies in the diagnoses of solid malignancies in a Brazilian academic hospital. We reviewed charts and autopsy reports of the patients that died from 2001 to 2003 with at least one solid neoplasm. Patients were classified in concordant and discordant cases regarding cancer diagnosis. Discordant cases were categorized in undiagnosed cases (no suspicion of cancer) and in misdiagnosed cases (clinical suspicion of cancer but incompletely diagnosed). Among the 264 patients with a single non-incidental solid neoplasm, the clinico-pathological discrepancy rate was 37.1%. Liver (22.5%), lung (19.4%), and pancreatic cancer (15.3%) were the most frequent malignancies in the discordant group. Misdiagnosis category comprised 68% of the discordant cases, i.e., there was no correct knowledge about the tumor primary site and/or the histological type during life. Our data show that a high rate of discrepancies occurs in solid malignancies.

Consequently, the delineation of cytoarchitectonic fields based on probabilistic maps and brain volume changes, as well as small-scale changes seen in MRI scans need to be verified by neuronanatomical/neuropathological diagnostic tools. To attend the current interdisciplinary needs of the scientific community, brain banks have to broaden their scope in order to provide high quality tissue suitable for neuroimaging- neuropathology/anatomy correlation studies. The Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Research Group (BBBABSG) of the University of Sao Paulo Medical School (USPMS) collaborates with researchers interested in neuroimaging-neuropathological correlation studies providing brains submitted to postmortem MRI in-situ. In this paper we describe and discuss the parameters established by the BBBABSG to select and to handle brains for fine-scale neuroimaging-neuropathological correlation studies, and to exclude inappropriate/unsuitable autopsy brains. We tried to assess the impact of the postmortem time and storage of the corpse on the quality of the MRI scans and to establish fixation protocols that are the most appropriate to these correlation studies. After investigation of a total of 36 brains, postmortem interval and low body temperature proved to be the main factors determining the quality of routine MRI protocols. Perfusion fixation of the brains after autopsy by mannitol 20% followed by formalin 20% was the best method for preserving the original brain shape and volume, and for allowing further routine and immunohistochemical staining. Taken to together, these parameters offer a methodological progress in screening and processing of human postmortem tissue in order to guarantee high quality material for unbiased correlation studies and to avoid expenditures by post-imaging analyses and histological processing of brain tissue. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.",Banking | Brain | Confounder | MRI | Neuropathology | Postmortem,25,0,FAPESP,06/55318-1,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,papers by authors,1,2008-09-01

TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), encoded by the TARDBP gene, has been identified as the major pathological protein of FTLD with ubiquitin- immunoreactive (ub-ir) inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and sporadic ALS. Recently, mutations in the TARDBP gene in familial and sporadic ALS have been reported which demonstrate that abnormal TDP-43 alone is sufficient to cause neu - rodegeneration. Several familial cases of FTLD-U, however, are now known to have mutations in the progranulin (GRN) gene, but granulin is not a component of the TDP-43-and ub-ir inclusions. Further, TDP-43 is found to be a component of the inclusions of an increasing number of neurodegenerative diseases. Other FTLD-U entities with TDP-43 proteinopathy include: FTLD-U with valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene mutation and FTLD with ALS linked to chromosome 9p. In contrast, chromosome 3-linked dementia, FTLD-U with chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B) mutation, has ub-ir, TDP-43-negative inclusions. In summary, recent discoveries have generated new insights into the pathogenesis of a spectrum of disorders called TDP-43 proteinopathies including: FTLD-U, FTLD-U with ALS, ALS, and a broadening spectrum of other disorders. It is anticipated that these discoveries and a revised nosology of FTLD will contribute toward an accurate diagnosis, and facilitate the development of new diagnostic tests and therapeutics. © 2008 EFNS.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | Frontotemporal dementia | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | Granulin | Motor neuron disease | TARDBP | TDP-43 | Ubiquitin | Valosin-containing protein,97,0,NIA,P01AG003991,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2008-08-01

In the near future, these markers will be of high relevance for the selection of at-risk subjects in secondary preventive trials. Methods: We describe the methodology and diagnostic value of manual volumetry of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, automated voxel-based morphometry, cortical thickness measurement, basal forebrain volumetry and deformation-based morphometry, implementing multivariate statistics and machine learning algorithms to improve group separation and prediction of AD in at-risk groups. We also describe the methodological basis and results obtained in AD using the recently developed technique of diffusion tensor-based morphometry (DTI). This technique gives access to the integrity of subcortical fibre systems in the human brain. Results: The best established structural biomarker of AD to date is hippocampus volume that already has been implemented as secondary endpoint in clinical trials on disease modification in AD. Automated approaches will gain an increasing role as endpoints of clinical trials in the near future given the interest in these techniques expressed by the regulatory authorities. DTI is still a developing field where analysis techniques are presently being devised to make optimal use of the multivariate data. Data on changes of fibre tract in preclinical AD are still limited, but the first results are promising in respect to a further enhancement of diagnostic accuracy by combining MRI and DTI. Conclusion: Besides their diagnostic use, MRI and DTI will broaden our understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and the structural and functional basis of normal cognition. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Alzheimer's disease | Brain atrophy | Dementia | Diagnosis | Disconnection | DTI | Hippocampus | MRI,68,0,BMBF,01 GI 0102,Janssen Biotech,papers by authors,0,2008-03-01

Recent advances in molecular genetics, biochemistry, and neuropathology of FTLD prompted the Midwest Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and experts at other centers to review and revise the existing neuropathologic diagnostic criteria for FTLD. The proposed criteria for FTLD are based on existing criteria, which include the tauopathies [FTLD with Pick bodies, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, sporadic multiple system tauopathy with dementia, argyrophilic grain disease, neurofibrillary tangle dementia, and FTD with microtubule-associated tau (MAPT) gene mutation, also called FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17)]. The proposed criteria take into account new disease entities and include the novel molecular pathology, TDP-43 proteinopathy, now recognized to be the most frequent histological finding in FTLD. TDP-43 is a major component of the pathologic inclusions of most sporadic and familial cases of FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without motor neuron disease (MND). Molecular genetic studies of familial cases of FTLD-U have shown that mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene are a major genetic cause of FTLD-U. Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene are present in rare familial forms of FTD, and some families with FTD and/or MND have been linked to chromosome 9p, and both are types of FTLD-U. Thus, familial TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with defects in multiple genes, and molecular genetics is required in these cases to correctly identify the causative gene defect. In addition to genetic heterogeneity amongst the TDP-43 proteinopathies, there is also neuropathologic heterogeneity and there is a close relationship between genotype and FTLD-U subtype. In addition to these recent significant advances in the neuropathology of FTLD-U, novel FTLD entities have been further characterized, including neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease. The proposed criteria incorporate up-to-date neuropathology of FTLD in the light of recent immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic advances. These criteria will be of value to the practicing neuropathologist and provide a foundation for clinical, clinico-pathologic, mechanistic studies and in vivo models of pathogenesis of FTLD. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",Charged multivesicular body protein 2B | Frontotemporal dementia | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | Motor neuron disease | Neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease | Neuropathologic diagnosis | Progranulin | Progressive non-fluent aphasia | Semantic dementia | Tauopathy | TDP-43 proteinopathy | Ubiquitin | Valosin-containing protein,834,1,DLPF,undefined,David and Lucile Packard Foundation,papers by authors,0,2007-07-01

In the present paper, we report the methods applied at and the first results of the Brain Bank of the Brazilian Aging Brain Study Group (BBBABSG) which has two main aims: (1) To collect a large number of brains of elderly comprising non-demented subjects and a large spectrum of pathologies related to aging brain processes, (2) To provide quality material to a multidisciplinar research network unraveling multiple aspects of aging brain processes and related neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: The subjects are selected from the Sao Paulo Autopsy Service. Brain parts are frozen and fixated. CSF, carotids, kidney, heart and blood are also collected and DNA is extracted. The neuropathological examinations are carried out based on accepted criteria, using immunohistochemistry. Functional status are assessed through a collateral source based on a clinical protocol. Protocols are approved by the local ethics committee and a written informed consent form is obtained. Results: During the first 21 months, 1,602 samples were collected and were classified by Clinical Dementia Rating as CDR0: 65.7%; CDR0.5:12.6%, CDR1:8.2%, CDR2:5.4%, and CDR3:8.1%. On average, the cost for the processing each case stood at US$400. To date, 14 laboratories have been benefited by the BBBABSG. Conclusion: The high percentage of non-demented subjects and the ethnic diversity of this series may be significantly contributive toward aging brain processes and related neurodegenerative diseases understanding since BBBABSG outcomes may provide investigators the answers to some additional questions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.",Aging | Alzheimer's disease | Brainbanking | Dementia | Geriatrics | Neurodegenerative diseases | Neurology | Neuropathology,91,0,FAPESP,undefined,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo,papers by authors,0,2007-06-01

The neuropathology includes frontotemporal lobar atrophy, neuronal loss and gliosis and, in most cases, abundant Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). A Pick/Alzheimer's spectrum was proposed for the original family (HDDD1). Here we report the clinicopathologic case of an HDDD1 individual using modern immunohistochemical methods, contemporary neuropathologic diagnostic criteria to distinguish different frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLDs), and progranulin (PRGN) mutation analysis. Clinical onset was at age 62 years with personality changes and disinhibition, followed by nonfluent dysphasia, and memory loss that progressed to muteness and total dependence with death at age 84 years. There was severe generalized brain atrophy (weight=570 g). Histopathology showed superficial microvacuolation, marked neuronal loss, gliosis, and ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative cytoplasmic and intranuclear neuronal inclusions in frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices. There were also frequent neuritic plaques and NFTs in parietal and occipital cortices. The case met neuropathologic criteria for both FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U), and Alzheimer disease (Braak NFT stage V). We discovered a novel pathogenic PGRN mutation c.5913 A>G (IVS6-2 A>G) segregating with FTLD-U in this kindred. In conclusion, HDDD1 is an FTLD-U caused by a PGRN mutation and is neuropathologically heterogeneous with Alzheimer disease as a common comorbidity. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Alzheimer disease | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | FTLD-U | HDDD1 | Progranulin mutation,56,0,NIA,P01AG003991,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2007-01-01

Hereditary dysphasic disinhibition dementia (HDDD) is a frontotemporal dementia with prominent changes in behavior and language deficits. A previous study found significant linkage to chromosome 17 in a HDDD family (HDDD2), but no mutation in the MAPT gene. Longitudinal follow-up has enabled us to identify new cases and to further characterize the dementia in this family. The goals of this study were to develop research criteria to classify the different clinical expressions of dementia observed in this large kindred, to identify the causal mutation in affected individuals and correlate this with phenotypic characteristics in this pedigree, and to assess the neuropathological characteristics using immunohistochemical techniques. Methods: In this study we describe a detailed clinical, pathological and mutation analysis of the HDDD2 kindred. Results: Neuropathologically, HDDD2 represents a familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U). We developed research classification criteria and identified three distinct diagnostic thresholds, which helped localize the disease locus. The chromosomal region with the strongest evidence of linkage lies within the minimum critical region for FTLD-U. Sequencing of each exon of the PGRN gene led to the identification of a novel missense mutation, Ala-9 Asp, within the signal peptide. Interpretation: HDDD2 is an FTLD-U caused by a missense mutation in the PGRN gene that cosegregates with the disease and with the disease haplotype in at-risk individuals. This mutation is the first reported pathogenic missense mutation in the signal peptide of the PGRN gene causing FTLD-U. In light of the previous reports of null mutations and its position in the gene, two possible pathological mechanisms are proposed: (1) the protein may accumulate within the endoplasmic reticulum due to inefficient secretion; and (2) mutant RNA may have a lower expression because of degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. © 2006 American Neurological Association.",,173,0,NIA,P01AG003991,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2006-09-01

Functional evidence of airway-parenchyma uncoupling in asthma, such as loss of deep breath bronchodilator effect in bronchoconstrictive episodes and enhanced airway closure, has been previously demonstrated. Elastic fibers are essential to maintain adequate elastic recoil of the lungs. In this study, we hypothesized that alveolar attachments could be abnormal and that elastic fibers could be damaged in the distal lungs of patients with fatal asthma. For this purpose, we measured the number of abnormal alveolar attachments and quantified the content of elastic fibers in the adventitial layer of small airways and in the peribronchial and distal alveolar septa of 15 patients who died of asthma (FA) and 9 control subjects (CTRL). Our data (geometric mean [range]) showed an increased proportion of abnormal alveolar attachments per centimeter of basement membrane perimeter in fatal asthma (FA, 0.18 [0.03-4.00]; CTRL, 0.00 [0.00-0.12]; p < 0.001) and decreased elastic fiber content in the small airway adventitial layer (FA, 4.08 [2.22-11.46] μm; CTRL, 6.79 [5.62-10.0] μm; p = 0.01) and in the peribronchial alveoli (FA, 1.08 [0.46-1.91] μm; CTRL, 1.81 [1.22-1.74] μm; = 0.003), but not in the distal alveoli.

The morphology of connexin-expressing cells can be best studied in transgenic mouse lines expressing cytoplasmic fluorescent reporters, since immunolabeling the plaques can obscure the shapes of the individual cells. The Cx43kiECFP mouse generated by Degen et al. (FASEBJ 26:4576, 2012) expresses cytosolic ECFP and has previously been used to establish that Cx43 may not be expressed by all astrocytes within a population, and this can vary in a region-dependent way. To establish this mouse line as a tool for future astrocyte and connexin research, we sought to consolidate reporter authenticity, studying cell types and within-region population heterogeneity. Applying anti-GFP, all cell types related to astroglia were positive—namely, protoplasmic astrocytes in the hippocampus, cortex, thalamus, spinal cord, olfactory bulb, cerebellum with Bergmann glia and astrocytes also in the molecular layer, and retinal Müller cells and astrocytes. Labeled cell types further comprise white matter astrocytes, olfactory ensheathing cells, radial glia-like stem cells, retinal pigment epithelium cells, ependymal cells, and meningeal cells. We furthermore describe a retinal Cx43-expressing amacrine cell morphologically reminiscent of ON-OFF wide-field amacrine cells, representing the first example of a mammalian CNS neuron-expressing Cx43 protein. In double staining with cell type–specific markers (GFAP, S100ß, glutamine synthetase), Cx43 reporter expression in the hippocampus and cortex was restricted to GFAP+ astrocytes. Altogether, this mouse line is a highly reliable tool for studies of Cx43-expressing CNS cells and astroglial cell morphology. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",astrocyte | hippocampus | Müller cell | radial glia | retina,15,1,,SPP1757,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,papers by authors,3,2017-11-01

We hypothesized that ADK might be an upstream regulator of adenosine-based homeostatic brain functions by simultaneously affecting several downstream pathways. We therefore studied the relationship between ADK expression, levels of extracellular adenosine, synaptic transmission, intrinsic excitability, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-dependent synaptic actions in transgenic mice underexpressing or overexpressing ADK. We demonstrate that ADK: 1) Critically influences the basal tone of adenosine, evaluated by microelectrode adenosine biosensors, and its release following stimulation; 2) determines the degree of tonic adenosine-dependent synaptic inhibition, which correlates with differential plasticity at hippocampal synapses with low release probability; 3) modulates the age-dependent effects of BDNF on hippocampal synaptic transmission, an action dependent upon co-activation of adenosine A2A receptors; and 4) influences GABAA receptor-mediated currents in CA3 pyramidal neurons. We conclude that ADK provides important upstream regulation of adenosine-based homeostatic function of the brain and that this mechanism is necessary and permissive to synaptic actions of adenosine acting on multiple pathways. These mechanistic studies support previous therapeutic studies and implicate ADK as a promising therapeutic target for upstream control of multiple neuronal signaling pathways crucial for a variety of neurological disorders. © The Author 2012.",Adenosine | Brain-derived neurotrophic factor | GABA | Homeostasis | Transgenic mice,48,1,NIH,R01MH083973,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,7,2014-01-01

In the short time since the discovery of microRNAs, the literature has burgeoned with studies focused on the biosynthesis of microRNAs, target prediction and binding, and mechanisms of translational repression by microRNAs. Given the prominent role of microRNAs in all areas of cell biology, it is not surprising that microRNAs are also linked to human diseases, including those of the nervous system. One of the least-studied areas of microRNA research is how their expression is regulated outside of development and cancer. Thus, we examined a role for regulation of microRNAs by neurotransmitter receptor activation in mouse brain. We focused on the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors by using intracerebroventricular injection of the selective agonist, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) in mouse brain. We then examined the expression of microRNAs in the cerebral cortex by Ambion and Invitrogen microarrays, and the expression of mature microRNA sequences by SABiosciences qPCR arrays, at 4, 8 and 24. h after DHPG injection. These studies revealed that the largest number of significantly regulated microRNAs was detected 8. h after DHPG injection in the microarrays and qPCR arrays. We then used RNA blots to quantify microRNA expression, and in situ hybridization to examine cellular distribution of the microRNAs regulated by DHPG. Bioinformatic analysis of the microRNAs regulated 8. h after DHPG in all three arrays revealed KEGG pathways that are known to correlate with group I mGluR effects, as well as recently described and novel pathways. These studies are the first to show that DHGP regulates the expression of microRNAs in mouse cerebral cortex, and support the hypothesis that group I mGluRs may regulate microRNA expression in mouse brain. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..",,3,0,NIH,R01NS050221,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2012-06-01

Recently, KD and analogous metabolic strategies have shown therapeutic promise in other neurologic disorders, such as reducing brain injury, pain, and inflammation. Here, we have shown that KD can reduce seizures in mice by increasing activation of adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs). When transgenic mice with spontaneous seizures caused by deficiency in adenosine metabolism or signaling were fed KD, seizures were nearly abolished if mice had intact A1Rs, were reduced if mice expressed reduced A1Rs, and were unaltered if mice lacked A 1Rs. Seizures were restored by injecting either glucose (metabolic reversal) or an A1R antagonist (pharmacologic reversal). Western blot analysis demonstrated that the KD reduced adenosine kinase, the major adenosine-metabolizing enzyme. Importantly, hippocampal tissue resected from patients with medically intractable epilepsy demonstrated increased adenosine kinase. We therefore conclude that adenosine deficiency may be relevant to human epilepsy and that KD can reduce seizures by increasing A1R-mediated inhibition.",,179,1,NSF,0843585,National Science Foundation,papers by authors,1,2011-07-01

To date, viral-mediated delivery and endogenous expression of antisense sequences as a strategy to prevent seizures have received little attention in epilepsy therapy development efforts. Here we validate adenosine kinase (ADK), the astrocyte-based key negative regulator of the brain's endogenous anticonvulsant adenosine, as a potential therapeutic target for antisense-mediated seizure suppression. Methods: Wedeveloped adenoassociated virus 8 (AAV8)-based gene therapy vectors to selectively modulate ADK expression in astrocytes. Cell type selectivity was achieved by expressing an Adk-cDNA in sense or antisense orientation under the control of an astrocyte-specific gfaABC1D promoter. Viral vectors where injected into the CA3 of wild-type mice or spontaneously epileptic Adk-tg transgenic mice that overexpress ADK in brain. After virus injection, ADK expression was assessed histologically and biochemically. In addition, intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were obtained. Key Findings: We demonstrate in wild-type mice that viral overexpression of ADK within astrocytes is sufficient to trigger spontaneous recurrent seizures in the absence of any other epileptogenic event, whereas ADK down-regulation via AAV8-mediated RNA interference almost completely abolished spontaneous recurrent seizures in Adk-tg mice. Significance: Our data demonstrate that modulation of astrocytic ADK expression can trigger or prevent seizures, respectively.

Adenosine is a possible candidate for local delivery based on its proven anti-epileptic effects. Neural stem cells constitute an ideal cell source for intracerebral transplantation and long-term drug delivery. In order to develop a cell-based system for the long-term delivery of adenosine, we isolated neural progenitor cells from adenosine kinase deficient mice (Adk/) and compared their differentiation potential and adenosine release properties with corresponding wild-type cells. Methods: Fetal neural progenitor cells were isolated from the brains of Adk/and C57BL/6 mice fetuses and expanded in vitro. Before and after neural differentiation, supernatants were collected and assayed for adenosine release using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Adk/cells secreted significantly more adenosine compared to wild-type cells at any time point of differentiation. Undifferentiated Adk/cells secreted 137 ± 5 ng adenosine per 105 cells during 24 h in culture, compared to 11 ± 1 ng released from corresponding wild-type cells. Adenosine release was maintained after differentiation as differentiated Adk/cells continued to release significantly more adenosine per 24 h (47 ± 1 ng per 105 cells) compared to wild-type cells (3 ± 0.2 ng per 105 cells). Conclusions: Fetal neural progenitor cells isolated from Adk/mice - but not those from C57BL/6 mice-release amounts of adenosine considered to be of therapeutic relevance. © 2010 British Epilepsy Association.

The Bcl-2 family protein Bim, a proapoptotic member of the BCL-2 homology domain 3-only subfamily, has been implicated as an important mediator of neuronal cell damage in various pathological conditions, although its role in epilepsy-associated cell death is not understood. We performed intrahippocampal stereotaxic injections of the glutamate analog kainic acid as an in vivo model of acute excitotoxicity to assess neuronal injury in Bim-deficient and control wild-type mice. A variety of cell death parameters including chromatin condensation, TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and caspase-3 activity was assessed. We found no differences in the extent of hippocampal neuronal death parameters between the 2 groups. Moreover, electroencephalographic recordings after kainic acid injection revealed indistinguishable patterns of seizure activity in Bim-deficient and wild-type animals. These in vivo and histological data suggest that Bim is not critically involved in excitotoxicity-induced acute neuronal cell injury. © 2008 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.",Apoptosis | Cell death | Epilepsy | Excitotoxicity | Hippocampus | Kainic acid | Neurodegeneration,19,1,FP7,202167,Seventh Framework Programme,papers by authors,5,2009-01-01

The present study investigated how methodological differences and lesion size may have contributed to these discrepancies. In Experiment 1 we compared rats with complete, partial (septal) and sham hippocampal lesions on a spontaneous object recognition task, using a protocol previously reported to result in deficits following large hippocampal lesions [10]. Rats with complete and partial hippocampal lesions were unimpaired, suggesting the hippocampus is not required for object recognition memory. However, rats with partial lesions showed relatively poor performance raising the possibility that floor effects masked a deficit on this group. In Experiment 2, we used a second spontaneous object recognition protocol similar to that used by the two other studies that have reported deficits following hippocampal lesions [6,26]. Rats with complete hippocampal lesions were significantly impaired, whereas rats with partial lesions were unimpaired. However, the complete lesion group showed less object exploration during the sample phase. Thus, the apparent recognition memory deficit in Experiment 2 may be attributable to differential encoding. Together, these findings suggest that the hippocampus is not required for intact spontaneous object recognition memory. These findings suggest that levels of object exploration during the sample phase may be a critical issue, and raise the possibility that previous reports of object recognition deficits may be due to differences in object exploration rather than deficits in object recognition per se. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The APOEε4 allele and male sex have previously been reported to associate with increased CAA in AD. To inform biomarker and therapeutic target discovery, we aimed to identify additional genetic risk factors and biological pathways involved in this vascular component of AD etiology. We present a genome-wide association study of CAA pathology in AD cases and report sex- and APOE-stratified assessment of this phenotype. Genome-wide genotypes were collected from 853 neuropathology-confirmed AD cases scored for CAA across five brain regions, and imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. Key variables and genome-wide genotypes were tested for association with CAA in all individuals and in sex and APOEε4 stratified subsets. Pathway enrichment was run for each of the genetic analyses. Implicated loci were further investigated for functional consequences using brain transcriptome data from 1,186 samples representing seven brain regions profiled as part of the AMP-AD consortium. We confirmed association of male sex, AD neuropathology and APOEε4 with increased CAA, and identified a novel locus, LINC-PINT, associated with lower CAA amongst APOEε4-negative individuals (rs10234094-C, beta = −3.70 [95% CI −0.49—−0.24]; p = 1.63E-08). Transcriptome profiling revealed higher LINC-PINT expression levels in AD cases, and association of rs10234094-C with altered LINC-PINT splicing. Pathway analysis indicates variation in genes involved in neuronal health and function are linked to CAA in AD patients.

Herein, we resolved the functional mechanism by which APOE3-Jac reduces APOE aggregation and enhances its lipidation in human brains, as well as in cellular and biochemical assays. Compared to APOE3, expression of APOE3-Jac in astrocytes increases several classes of lipids in the brain including phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, and sulfatide, critical for synaptic functions. Mice expressing APOE3-Jac have reduced amyloid pathology, plaque-associated immune responses, and neuritic dystrophy. The V236E substitution is also sufficient to reduce the aggregation of APOE4, whose gene allele is a major genetic risk factor for AD and DLB.

Leveraging the considerable clinical and neuropathologic heterogeneity associated with PSP, we measured tau neuropathology as quantitative traits to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) within PSP to identify genes and biological pathways that underlie the PSP disease process. In 882 PSP cases, semi-quantitative scores for phosphorylated tau-immunoreactive coiled bodies (CBs), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), tufted astrocytes (TAs), and tau threads were documented from 18 brain regions, and converted to latent trait (LT) variables using the R ltm package. LT analysis utilizes a multivariate regression model that links categorical responses to unobserved covariates allowing for a reduction of dimensionality, generating a single, continuous variable to account for the multiple lesions and brain regions assessed. We first tested for association with PSP LTs and the top PSP GWAS susceptibility loci. Significant SNP/LT associations were identified at rs242557 (MAPT H1c sub-haplotype) with hindbrain CBs and rs1768208 (MOBP) with forebrain tau threads. Digital microscopy was employed to quantify phosphorylated tau burden in midbrain tectum and red nucleus in 795 PSP cases and tau burdens were used as quantitative phenotypes in GWAS. Top associations were identified at rs1768208 with midbrain tectum and red nucleus tau burden. Additionally, we performed a PSP LT GWAS on an initial cohort, a follow-up SNP panel (37 SNPs, P < 10–5) in an extended cohort, and a combined analysis. Top SNP/LT associations were identified at SNPs in or near SPTBN5/EHD4, SEC13/ATP2B2, EPHB1/PPP2R3A, TBC1D8, IFNGR1/OLIG3, ST6GAL1, HK1, CALB1, and SGCZ.

In our cross-sectional study, we assessed cerebellar tissue from 28 well-characterized C9orf72 expansion carriers. We obtained 3507 on-target circular consensus sequencing reads, of which 814 bridged the C9orf72 repeat expansion (23%). Importantly, we observed a significant correlation between expansion sizes obtained using No-Amp sequencing and Southern blotting (P = 5.0 × 10-4). Interestingly, we also detected a significant survival advantage for individuals with smaller expansions (P = 0.004). Additionally, we uncovered that smaller expansions were significantly associated with higher levels of C9orf72 transcripts containing intron 1b (P = 0.003), poly(GP) proteins (P = 1.3 × 10- 5), and poly(GA) proteins (P = 0.005). Thorough examination of the composition of the expansion revealed that its GC content was extremely high (median: 100%) and that it was mainly composed of GGGGCC repeats (median: 96%), suggesting that expanded C9orf72 repeats are quite pure. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that No-Amp sequencing is a powerful tool that enables the discovery of relevant clinicopathological associations, highlighting the important role played by the cerebellar size of the expanded repeat in C9orf72-linked diseases.",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | C9orf72 | frontotemporal lobar degeneration | long-read sequencing | motor neuron disease,0,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2021-04-01

In the past, these individuals often received a late diagnosis; however, availability of CSF and PET biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathologies and incorporation of atypical forms of Alzheimer's disease into new diagnostic criteria increasingly allows them to be more confidently diagnosed early in their illness. This early diagnosis in turn allows patients to be offered tailored information, appropriate care and support, and individualised treatment plans. These advances will provide improved access to clinical trials, which often exclude atypical phenotypes. Research into atypical Alzheimer's disease has revealed previously unrecognised neuropathological heterogeneity across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.

Nigrostriatal dopamine transporter uptake was evaluated with 123I-FP-CIT SPECT using DaTQUANT software. Hippocampal volume was calculated with magnetic resonance imaging, cingulate island sign ratio with FDG-PET, and global cortical PiB retention with PiB-PET.

Here, we examined the regional distribution of tau pathology in a large cohort of postmortem brains (n = 914). We found an early vulnerability of the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus to neurofibrillary degeneration in PART, and semiquantitative assessment of neurofibrillary degeneration in CA2 was significantly greater than in CA1 in PART. In contrast, subjects harboring intermediate-to-high AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) displayed relative sparing of CA2 until later stages of their disease course. In addition, the CA2/CA1 ratio of neurofibrillary degeneration in PART was significantly higher than in subjects with intermediate-to-high ADNC burden. Furthermore, the distribution of tau pathology in PART diverges from the Braak NFT staging system and Braak stage does not correlate with cognitive function in PART as it does in individuals with intermediate-to-high ADNC. These findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the contribution of PART to cognitive impairment and how neurofibrillary degeneration interacts with Aβ pathology in AD and PART.",Alzheimer disease | CA2 | Cognitive status | Cornu ammonis | Hippocampal subfields | Neurodegenerative disease | Primary age-related tauopathy,3,0,,undefined,National Science Foundation,papers by authors,7,2021-01-01

Objective: To determine whether CMBs on antemortem MRI correlate with CAA. Methods: We reviewed 54 consecutive participants with antemortem T2*GRE-MRI sequences and subsequent autopsy. CMBs were quantified on MRIs closest to death. Autopsy CAA burden was quantified in each region including leptomeningeal/cortical and capillary CAA. By a clustering approach, we examined the relationship among CAA variables and performed principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction to produce two scores from these 15 interrelated predictors. Hurdle models assessed relationships between principal components and lobar CMBs. Results: MRI-based CMBs appeared in 20/54 (37%). 10 participants had =2 lobar-only CMBs. The first two components of the PCA analysis of the CAA variables explained 74% variability. The first rotated component (RPC1) consisted of leptomeningeal and cortical CAA and the second rotated component of capillary CAA (RPC2). Both the leptomeningeal and cortical component and the capillary component correlated with lobar-only CMBs. The capillary CAA component outperformed the leptomeningeal and cortical CAA component in predicting lobar CMBs. Both capillary and the leptomeningeal/cortical components correlated with number of lobar CMBs. Conclusion: Capillary and leptomeningeal/cortical scores correlated with lobar CMBs on MRI but lobar CMBs were more closely associated with the capillary component. The capillary component correlated with APOE ?4, highlighting lobar CMBs as one aspect of CAA phenotypic diversity.

It is unclear how TDP-43 contributes to the rate of clinical decline. Objective: To determine whether cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive and functional decline are associated with anatomical distribution of TDP-43 in the brain. Methods: Longitudinal clinical-neuropathologic autopsy cohort study of 385 initially cognitively normal/mildly impaired older adults prospectively followed until death. We investigated how TDP-43, amyloid-β (Aβ), tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), Lewy body disease (LBD), age, sex, and genetics are associated with clinical scores and rates of their longitudinal decline. Results: Of 385 participants, 260 (68%) had no TDP-43, 32 (8%) had TDP-43 limited to amygdala, and 93 (24%) had TDP-43 in the hippocampus and beyond. Higher TDP-43 and Braak NFT stages independently were associated with faster decline in global cognition, functional performance measured by Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and naming and episodic memory, whereas older age was associated with slower rate of cognitive, psychiatric, and functional decline. Cross-sectionally the following associations were found: higher TDP-43 and Braak NFT-worse performance; higher Aβ burden-worse global cognition, more behavioral changes, the latter also with higher LBD; older age-worse naming, lower frequency of behavioral changes; female sex-more impaired naming and better preserved episodic memory. There were no genetic associations. Conclusion: The association of TDP-43 distribution with decline in cognitive and functional performance suggests that TDP-43 is playing a role in the clinical progression to dementia. Further characterization of clinical features associated with TDP-43 can facilitate establishment of antemortem diagnosis.",Alzheimer's disease | clinical decline | dementia | neuropsychology | TDP-43 proteinopathy,0,1,NIH,P30 AG062677,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,9,2021-01-01

Another protein, TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been identified in up to 75% of cases of Alzheimer's disease. TDP-43, tau and amyloid-b have all been linked to hippocampal atrophy. TDP-43 and tau have also been linked to hippocampal atrophy in cases of primary age-related tauopathy, a pathological entity with features that strongly overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease. At present, it is unclear whether and how TDP-43 and tau are associated with early or late hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy, whether either protein is also associated with faster rates of atrophy of other brain regions and whether there is evidence for protein-associated acceleration/deceleration of atrophy rates. We therefore aimed to model how these proteins, particularly TDP-43, influence non-linear trajectories of hippocampal and neocortical atrophy in Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy. In this longitudinal retrospective study, 557 autopsied cases with Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes with 1638 ante-mortem volumetric head MRI scans spanning 1.0-16.8 years of disease duration prior to death were analysed. TDP-43 and Braak neurofibrillary tangle pathological staging schemes were constructed, and hippocampal and neocortical (inferior temporal and middle frontal) brain volumes determined using longitudinal FreeSurfer. Bayesian bivariate-outcome hierarchical models were utilized to estimate associations between proteins and volume, early rate of atrophy and acceleration in atrophy rates across brain regions. High TDP-43 stage was associated with smaller cross-sectional brain volumes, faster rates of brain atrophy and acceleration of atrophy rates, more than a decade prior to death, with deceleration occurring closer to death. Stronger associations were observed with hippocampus compared to temporal and frontal neocortex. Conversely, low TDP-43 stage was associated with slower early rates but later acceleration. This later acceleration was associated with high Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage. Somewhat similar, but less striking, findings were observed between TDP-43 and neocortical rates. Braak stage appeared to have stronger associations with neocortex compared to TDP-43. The association between TDP-43 and brain atrophy occurred slightly later in time (∼3 years) in cases of primary age-related tauopathy compared to Alzheimer's disease. The results suggest that TDP-43 and tau have different contributions to acceleration and deceleration of brain atrophy rates over time in both Alzheimer's disease and primary age-related tauopathy.",Braak stage | Longitudinal | PART | Rate of atrophy | TDP-43,5,1,NIA,P30 AG062677,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,10,2021-01-01

However, the specific H1 subhaplotype association is not well defined, and it is not clear whether any MAPT haplotypes influence severity of tau pathology or clinical presentation in CBD. Therefore, in the current study we examined 230 neuropathologically confirmed CBD cases and 1312 controls in order to assess associations of MAPT haplotypes with risk of CBD, severity of tau pathology (measured as semi-quantitative scores for coiled bodies, neurofibrillary tangles, astrocytic plaques, and neuropil threads), age of CBD onset, and disease duration. After correcting for multiple testing (P < 0.0026 considered as significant), we confirmed the strong association between the MAPT H2 haplotype and decreased risk of CBD (Odds ratio = 0.26, P = 2 × 10−12), and also observed a novel association between the H1d subhaplotype and an increased CBD risk (Odds ratio = 1.76, P = 0.002). Additionally, although not statistically significant after correcting for multiple testing, the H1c haplotype was associated with a higher risk of CBD (Odds ratio = 1.49, P = 0.009). No MAPT haplotypes were significantly associated with any tau pathology measures, age of CBD onset, or disease duration. Though replication will be important and there is potential that population stratification could have influenced our findings, these results suggest that several MAPT H1 subhaplotypes are primarily responsible for the strong association between MAPT H1 and risk of CBD, but that H1 subhaplotypes are unlikely to play a major role in driving tau pathology or clinical features. Our findings also indicate that similarities in MAPT haplotype risk-factor profile exist between CBD and the related tauopathy progressive supranuclear palsy, with H2, H1d, and H1c displaying associations with both diseases.",Corticobasal degeneration | Genetics | MAPT | Neuropathology,2,1,NIH,P50-NS072187,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2020-12-01

Despite reports of associations with other neurodegenerative diseases, there are few studies of these variants in purely neuropathologically diagnosed cohorts. Further, the effect of these mutations on neurodegenerative disease pathologies is unknown. In this study, we tested the effects of ABI3_rs616338-T and PLCG2_rs72824905-G on disease risk in autopsy cohorts comprised of 973 patients diagnosed neuropathologically with Lewy body disease (LBD-NP) and 1040 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), compared to 3351 controls. LBD-NP patients were further categorized as high, intermediate and low likelihood of clinical dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB-CL) based on DLB Consortium criteria. We also tested for association with both Braak neurofibrillary tau tangle (nTotal = 2008, nPSP = 1037, nLBD-NP = 971) and Thal phase amyloid plaque scores (nTotal = 1786, nPSP = 1018, nLBD-NP = 768). Additionally, 841 PSP patients had quantitative tau neuropathology measures that were assessed for genetic associations. There was no statistically significant association with disease risk for either LBD-NP or PSP in our study. LBD intermediate category disease risk was significantly associated with ABI3_rs616338-T (OR = 2.65, 95% CI 1.46–4.83, p = 0.001). PLCG2_rs72824905-G was associated with lower Braak stage (ß = − 0.822, 95% CI − 1.439 to − 0.204, p = 0.009). This effect was more pronounced in the PSP (ß = − 0.995, 95% CI − 1.773 to − 0.218, p = 0.012) than LBD-NP patients (ß = − 0.292, 95% CI − 1.283 to 0.698, p = 0.563).

These findings support a role for PLCG2_rs72824905-G in suppressing tau neuropathology. ABI3_rs616338-T may influence disease risk specifically in the LBD-NP intermediate category comprised of patients with diffuse neocortical or limbic LB, concurrently with moderate or high AD neuropathology, respectively.

Methods: 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT and neuropathologic findings among patients with neurodegenerative syndromes from the Mayo Alzheimer Disease Research Center and Mayo Clinic Study of Aging were examined. Three 123I-FP-CIT SPECT quantitative assessment methods —MIMneuro, DaTQUANT, and manual region-of-interest creation on a workstation—were compared with neuropathologic findings describing the presence or absence of Lewy body disease (LBD). Striatum-to-background ratios (SBRs) generated by DaTQUANT were compared with the calculated SBRs of the manual method and MIMneuro. The left and right SBRs for caudate, putamen, and striatum were evaluated with the manual method. For DaTQUANT and MIMneuro, the left, right, total, and average SBRs and z scores for whole striatum, caudate, putamen, anterior putamen, and posterior putamen were calculated.

Methods: Twenty-four patients had [18F]-flortaucipir–PET and died with FTLD (progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], n = 10; corticobasal degeneration [CBD], n = 10; FTLD-TDP, n = 3; and Pick disease, n = 1). All but 1 had Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts, and semiquantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta region of interest (meta-ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden. Results: Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ plaque count, with 100% specificity and 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty-one (87.5%) had Braak stages I to IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta-ROI SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age-related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.

Amounts of endothelial tight junction proteins claudin-5 (CLDN5) and occludin (OCLN), and major AD-related molecules (amyloid beta [Aβ40], Aβ42, tau, p-tau, and apolipoprotein E) in the temporal cortex were assessed by ELISA. Results: Higher levels of soluble tau, insoluble p-tau, and apolipoprotein E (apoE) were independently correlated with lower levels of endothelial tight junction proteins CLDN5 and OCLN in AD brains. Although high Aβ40 levels, APOE ε4, and male sex were predominantly associated with exacerbated CAA severity, those factors did not influence tight junction protein levels. Discussion: Refining the molecular mechanisms connecting tau, Aβ, and apoE with cerebrovascular pathologies is critical for greater understanding of AD pathogenesis and establishing effective therapeutic interventions for the disease.",Alzheimer's disease | blood-brain barrier | cerebral amyloid angiopathy | tau | tight junction,9,1,NIH,7AZ22,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2020-10-01

Few studies have examined the clinical variability and disease progression in PiD. We describe the clinical features, neuropsychological profiles and coexistent pathologies in 21 cases of autopsy-confirmed PiD. Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis of patients with Pick’s disease evaluated at Mayo Clinic, Rochester or Jacksonville (1995–2018), and identified through an existing database. Results: Twenty-one cases with sufficient clinical data were identified. Behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD; 12/21) was the most common phenotype, followed by primary progressive aphasia (PPA; 7/21), corticobasal syndrome (CBS; 1/21) and amnestic dementia (1/21). Median age at disease onset was 54 years, with PPA cases (median = 52 years) presenting earlier than bvFTD (median = 59). Median disease duration (onset–death) overall was 10 years and did not differ significantly between bvFTD (median = 9.5 years) and PPA (median = 13). Age at death was not significantly different in PPA (median = 66) compared to bvFTD (median = 68.5). A third of the cases (n = 7/21) demonstrated pure PiD pathology, while the remainder showed co-existent other pathologies including Alzheimer’s type (n = 6), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 3), combined Alzheimer’s and amyloid angiopathy (n = 4), and Lewy body disease (n = 1). Conclusions: Our study shows that bvFTD and PPA are the most common clinical phenotypes associated with PiD, although rare presentations such as CBS were also seen. Coexisting non-Pick’s pathology was also present in many cases.

TDP-43-positive status was assigned when TDP-43-immunoreactive inclusions were identified in the amygdala. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analyses compared TDP-43-positive (TDP-43[+]) with TDP-43-negative cases (TDP-43[-]), correcting for field strength, sex, Braak neurofibrillary tangle, and neuritic plaque stages. Cross-validated logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether regional FDG-PET values predict TDP-43 status. We also assessed the ratio of inferior temporal to medial temporal (IMT) metabolism as this was proposed as a biomarker of hippocampal sclerosis.ResultsOf 73 cases, 27 (37%) were TDP-43(+), of which 6 (8%) had hippocampal sclerosis. SPM analysis showed TDP-43(+) cases having greater hypometabolism of medial temporal, frontal superior medial, and frontal supraorbital (FSO) regions (punc < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed only FSO and IMT to be associated with TDP-43(+) status, identifying up to 81% of TDP-43(+) cases (p < 0.001). An IMT/FSO ratio was superior to the IMT in discriminating TDP-43(+) cases: 78% vs 48%, respectively.ConclusionsAlzheimer-related TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with hypometabolism in the medial temporal and frontal regions.

It is unclear whether TDP-43 is associated with a decreased likelihood of a clinical diagnosis of probable dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB) during life. Methods: In an autopsy cohort of 395 cognitively impaired patients from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, we determined the presence of TDP-43 in the hippocampus [hTDP-43(+)] and examined associations between hTDP-43 and an antemortem pDLB clinical diagnosis with multiple regression analyses. For this study, given our specific question, we only counted transitional and diffuse Lewy body disease as LBD positive (LBD+). Results: One-hundred forty-five cases (37%) were hTDP-43(+) and 156 (39%) were LBD+; co-pathology was noted in 63 (16%) cases. Patients with pDLB− LBD+ were more likely to be older, hTDP-43(+) and have high Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) status compared to the pDLB+ LBD+ patients. After accounting for older age at death and high Braak NFT status, hTDP-43(+) status was associated with the absence of a clinical diagnosis of pDLB despite LBD+ status (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The absence of a diagnosis of pDLB during life in patients with LBD is associated with older age, high Braak NFT stage and hTDP-43, each feature contributing independently to a lower likelihood of a clinical diagnosis of pDLB during life.",Clinical diagnosis | Dementia with Lewy bodies | Lewy body disease | Pathology | TDP-43,1,0,NIH,P50 AG16574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2020-05-01

FTP-PET was elevated in participants with Alzheimer's disease. An FTP-PET SUVR cut point of 1.29 was determined to be optimal. Quantitative measurements of hippocampal and temporal lobe tau burden were highly correlated to FTP-PET signal (rho's from 0.61 to 0.70, P ≤.02). Discussion: Elevated FTP-PET reflects Braak IV or greater neuropathology. Participants with primary age-related tauopathy and hippocampal sclerosis did not show elevated FTP-PET signal.

The cholinergic system, which is the target of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor therapy, is selectively vulnerable in AD. Objective: To investigate the major source of cholinergic innervation, the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), in order to determine whether there is differential involvement of NFT accumulation or neuronal loss among AD subtypes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, retrospective abstraction of clinical records and quantitative assessment of NFTs and neuron counts in the nbM was completed in January 2019 at the Mayo Clinic using the Florida Autopsied Multi-Ethnic (FLAME) cohort, which had been accessioned from 1991 until 2015. The FLAME cohort is derived from the deeded autopsy program funded throughout the State of Florida's memory disorder clinic referral services. Of the 2809 consecutively accessioned FLAME cohort, 1464 were identified as neuropathologically diagnosed AD cases and nondemented normal controls available for clinicopathologic assessment. Quantification of NFTs and neuronal density in the anterior nbM was performed blinded to neuropathologic groupings. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic and clinical characteristics, including cognitive decline measured using the Mini-Mental State Examination score (range, 0-30), were evaluated. The anterior nbM was investigated quantitatively for neuronal loss and NFT accumulation. Results: In total, 1361 AD subtypes and 103 nondemented controls were assessed. The median (interquartile range) age at death was 72 (66-80) years in hippocampal sparing (HpSp) AD, 81 (76-86) years in typical AD, and 86 (82-90) years in limbic predominant AD. The median (interquartile range) count per 0.125 mm2 of thioflavin S-positive NFTs was highest in the nbM of HpSp AD (14 [9-20]; n = 163), lower in typical AD (10 [5-16]; n = 937), and lowest in limbic predominant AD (8 [5-11], n = 163) (P <.001). The median (interquartile range) neuronal density per millimeters squared was lowest in HpSp AD cases (22 [17-28]; n = 148), higher in typical AD (25 [19-30]; n = 727), and highest in limbic predominant AD (26 [19-32]; n = 127) (P =.002). Multivariable regression modeling of clinical and demographic variables was performed to assess overlap in NFT accumulation and neuronal density differences among AD subtypes. Higher NFT accumulation in the nbM was associated with younger age at onset for HpSp AD (β, -1.5; 95% CI, -2.9 to -0.15; P =.03) and typical AD (β, -3.2; 95% CI, -3.9 to -2.4; P <.001). In addition, higher NFT accumulation in the nbM of typical AD cases was associated with female sex (β, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-3.5; P <.001), apolipoprotein E ϵ4 allele (β, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.15-2.5; P =.03), and lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (β, -1.8; 95% CI, -3.2 to -0.31; P =.02). Demographic and clinical progression variables were not associated with NFT accumulation in the nbM of limbic predominant AD cases. Conclusions and Relevance: These data provide supportive evidence that NFT accumulation in the nbM may underlie more widespread and severe cholinergic deficits in young-onset AD, in particular in patients with HpSp AD. Moreover, these findings underscore the importance of considering age at onset, sex, and apolipoprotein E genotype when assessing outcomes in AD.",,18,1,NIA,P50AG16574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2020-02-01

However, the pathologic basis and the differential diagnostic performance of Aβ PET are not established in DLB. Our objective was to investigate the pathologic correlates of 11C-Pittsburgh compound B(PiB) uptake on PET in cases with antemortem diagnosis of probable DLB or Lewy body disease (LBD) at autopsy. METHODS: Autopsied cases who underwent antemortem PiB-PET and were assigned a clinical diagnosis of probable DLB or LBD at autopsy were included (n = 39). The primary endpoint was pathologic diagnosis of LBD, Alzheimer disease (AD), or mixed (LBD and AD) pathology; the secondary endpoints included Thal Aβ phase and diffuse and neuritic Aβ plaques. RESULTS: Lower global cortical PiB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) distinguished cases with LBD from cases with AD or mixed pathology with an accuracy of 93%. Greater global cortical PiB SUVr correlated with higher Thal Aβ phase (r = 0.75, p ≤ 0.001). Voxel-based analysis demonstrated that Aβ pathology relatively spared the occipital lobes in cases with mixed pathology and LBD compared to cases with AD without LBD, in whom the entire cerebral cortex was involved. Global cortical PiB SUVr was associated primarily with the abundance of diffuse Aβ plaques in cases with LBD in a multivariable regression model. CONCLUSION: Lower PiB uptake accurately distinguishes cases with LBD from cases with AD or mixed pathology, correlating with the Thal Aβ phase. The severity of diffuse Aβ pathology is the primary contributor to elevated PiB uptake in LBD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence that lower PiB uptake accurately distinguishes patients with LBD from those with AD or mixed pathology.",,16,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,6,2020-01-01

Methods: Morphology, levels, and distribution of the mitophagy tag pS65-Ub were evaluated by biochemical analyses combined with tissue and single cell imaging in AD autopsy brain and in transgenic mouse models. Results: Analyses revealed significant increases of pS65-Ub levels in AD brain, which strongly correlated with granulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) and early phospho-tau deposits, but were independent of amyloid beta pathology. Single cell analyses revealed predominant co-localization of pS65-Ub with mitochondria, GVD bodies, and/or lysosomes depending on the brain region analyzed.

Objective: To evaluate whether the associations between TDP-43 and hippocampal volume and atrophy rate are affected by age, gender, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ϵ4, Lewy bodies (LBs), amyloid-β (Aβ), or Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage. Methods: In this longitudinal neuroimaging-clinicopathological study of 468 cases with AD neuropathological changes (Aβ-positive) that had completed antemortem head MRI, we investigated how age, gender, APOE ϵ4, presence of LBs, Aβ, TDP-43, and Braak NFT stages are associated with hippocampal volumes and rates of atrophy over time. We included field strength in the models since our cohort included 1.5T and 3T scans. We then determined whether the associations between hippocampal atrophy and TDP-43 are modified by these factors using mixed effects models. Results: Older age, female gender, APOE ϵ4, higher field strength, higher TDP-43, and Braak NFT stages were associated with smaller hippocampi. Rate of atrophy was greater with higher TDP-43 and Braak NFT stage, but lower in older patients. The association of TDP-43 with greater rate of atrophy was enhanced in APOE ϵ4 carriers (p = 0.04).

In conditions distinct from the frontotemporal lobar degenerations, TDP-43 appears to progress in a stereotypical pattern. In the present study, we aimed at providing a better understanding of the effects of TDP-43 and other age-related neuropathologies on cross-sectional grey matter volume in a cohort of non-FTLD subjects. We included 407 individuals with an antemortem MRI and post-mortem brain tissue from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, or the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. All individuals were assigned pathological stages for TDP-43, tau, amyloid-β, Lewy bodies, argyrophilic grain disease and vascular pathologies. Robust regressions were performed in regions of interest and voxel-wise to explore the relationships between TDP-43 stages and grey matter volume while controlling for other pathologies. Grey matter volumes adjusted for pathological and demographic variables were also computed for each TDP-43-positive case to further characterize the sequential involvement of brain structures associated with TDP-43, irrespective of the TDP-43 staging scheme. Robust regressions showed that the extent of TDP-43 pathology was associated with the extent of grey matter atrophy. Specifically, we found that the volume in medial temporal regions (i.e. amygdala, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus) decreased progressively with advancing TDP-43 stages. Importantly, these effects were of similar magnitude to those related to tau stages. Additional analyses using adjusted grey matter volume demonstrated a sequential pattern of volume loss associated with TDP-43, starting within the medial temporal lobe, followed by early involvement of the temporal pole, and eventually encompassing additional temporal and frontal regions. Altogether, this study demonstrates the major and independent contribution of TDP-43 pathology on neurodegeneration and provides further insight into the regional distribution of TDP-43 in non-FTLD subjects. Along with previous studies, these findings emphasized the importance of targeting TDP-43 in future clinical trials to prevent its detrimental effect on grey matter volume and, eventually, cognition.",B-amyloid | Neuropathology | Radiological-pathological study | Tau | TDP-43,16,0,NIH,P50 AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2019-11-01

The most common clinical presentation of PSP, referred to as Richardson syndrome, is that of atypical parkinsonism with vertical gaze palsy, axial rigidity, and frequent falls. Although cognitive deficits in PSP are often ascribed to subcortical dysfunction, a subset of patients has dementia with behavioral features similar to the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia. In this study we aimed to identify the clinical and pathological characteristics of PSP presenting with frontotemporal dementia. Methods: In this study, we compared clinical and pathologic characteristics of 31 patients with PSP with Richardson syndrome with 15 patients with PSP with frontotemporal dementia. For pathological analysis, we used semiquantitative methods to assess neuronal and glial lesions with tau immunohistochemistry, as well image analysis of tau burden using digital microscopic methods. Results: We found greater frontal and temporal neocortical neuronal tau pathology in PSP with frontotemporal dementia compared with PSP with Richardson syndrome. White matter tau pathology was also greater in PSP with frontotemporal dementia than PSP with Richardson syndrome. Genetic and demographic factors were not associated with atypical distribution of tau pathology in PSP with frontotemporal dementia. Conclusions: The results confirm the subset of cognitive-predominant PSP mimicking frontotemporal dementia in PSP. PSP with frontotemporal dementia has distinct clinical features that differ from PSP with Richardson syndrome, as well as differences in distribution and density of tau pathology. © 2019 The Authors.

This expansion, which represents the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and motor neuron disease (MND), results in a loss of C9orf72 expression and the generation of RNA foci and dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. The C9orf72 protein itself plays a role in vesicular transport, serving as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPases. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying C9orf72-related diseases and to identify potential disease modifiers, we performed an extensive RNA sequencing study. We included individuals for whom frontal cortex tissue was available: FTLD and FTLD/MND patients with (n = 34) or without (n = 44) an expanded C9orf72 repeat as well as control subjects (n = 24). In total, 6706 genes were differentially expressed between these groups (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05). The top gene was C9orf72 (FDR = 1.41E-14), which was roughly two-fold lower in C9orf72 expansion carriers than in (disease) controls. Co-expression analysis revealed groups of correlated genes (modules) that were enriched for processes such as protein folding, RNA splicing, synaptic signaling, metabolism, and Golgi vesicle transport. Within our cohort of C9orf72 expansion carriers, machine learning uncovered interesting candidates associated with clinico-pathological features, including age at onset (vascular endothelial growth factor A [VEGFA]), C9orf72 expansion size (cyclin dependent kinase like 1 [CDKL1]), DPR protein levels (eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase [EEF2K]), and survival after onset (small G protein signaling modulator 3 [SGSM3]). Given the fact that we detected a module involved in vesicular transport in addition to a GTPase activator (SGSM3) as a potential modifier, our findings seem to suggest that the presence of a C9orf72 repeat expansion might hamper vesicular transport and that genes affecting this process may modify the phenotype of C9orf72-linked diseases.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | C9orf72 | Frontotemporal dementia | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | Machine learning | Motor neuron disease | Repeat expansion disorders | RNA sequencing | Transcriptomics | Vesicular transport,14,1,NIH,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2019-10-01

Method: In this report, we studied 43 AD patients with CBS (AD-CBS) and compared them with 42 AD patients with typical amnestic syndrome (AD-AS), as well as 15 cases of corticobasal degeneration and CBS pathology. Results: Unlike AD-AS, AD-CBS had prominent motor problems, including limb apraxia (90%), myoclonus (81%), and gait disorders (70%). Alien limb phenomenon was reported in 26% and cortical sensory loss in 14%. Language problems were also more frequent in AD-CBS, and memory impairment was less frequent. AD-CBS had more tau pathology in perirolandic cortices but less in superior temporal cortex than AD-AS. In addition, AD-CBS had greater neuronal loss in the substantia nigra. Discussion: AD-CBS is a clinicopathological subtype of AD with an atypical distribution of Alzheimer-type tau pathology. Greater neuronal loss in the substantia nigra may contribute to Parkinsonism which is not a feature of typical AD.",Alzheimer's disease | Corticobasal syndrome | Neurodegeneration | Neuropathology | Tau,13,0,NIH,P01 NS84974,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2019-09-01

Methods: We performed quantitative neuropathologic comparison of 17 FTLD-C9ORF72 and 15 FTLD-GRN with a focus on microglia. For clinical comparisons, only cases with high quality medical documentation and concurring diagnoses by at least two neurologists were included (14 FTLD-GRN and 13 FTLD-C9ORF72). Neuropathological analyses were limited to TDP-43 Type A to assure consistent assessment between the groups, acknowledging that Type A is a minority of C9ORF72 patients. Furthermore, only cases with sufficient tissue from all regions were studied (11 FTLD-GRN and 11 FTLD-C9ORF72). FTLD cases were also compared to age– and sex–matched normal controls. Immunohistochemistry was performed for pTDP-43, IBA-1, CD68, and GFAP. Morphological characterization of microglia was performed in sections of cortex blinded to clinical and genetic information. Results: FTLD-GRN patients had frequent asymmetric clinical features, including aphasia and apraxia, as well as more asymmetric cortical atrophy. Neuropathologically, FTLD-C9ORF72 had greater hippocampal tau pathology and more TDP-43 neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. FTLD-GRN had more neocortical microvacuolation, as well as more IBA-1–positive ameboid microglia in superficial cortical layers and in subcortical white matter. FTLD-GRN also had more microglia with nuclear condensation, possibly indicating apoptosis. Microglial morphology with CD68 immunohistochemistry in FTLD-GRN and FTLD-C9ORF72 differed from controls. Interpretation: Our findings underscore differences in microglial response in FTLD-C9ORF72 and FTLD-GRN as shown by significant differences in ameboid microglia in gray and white matter. These results suggest the differential contribution of microglial dysfunction in FTLD-GRN and FTLD-C9ORF72 and suggest that clinical, neuroimaging and pathologic differences could in part be related to differences in microglia response.",,5,1,NIH,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,4,2019-09-01

However, it is unclear as to whether microtubule-associated protein tau H1 subhaplotypes are associated with the burden of neuropathological features of Lewy body disease. Objectives: To evaluate associations of microtubule-associated protein tau haplotypes with severity of Lewy body pathology and markers of SN neuronal loss in Lewy body disease cases. Methods: Five hundred eighty-five autopsy-confirmed Lewy body disease cases were included. Six microtubule-associated protein tau variants (rs1467967, rs242557, rs3785883, rs2471738, rs8070723, and rs7521) were genotyped to define common microtubule-associated protein tau haplotypes. Lewy body counts were measured in five cortical regions. Ventrolateral and medial SN neuronal loss were assessed semiquantitatively. Nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration was quantified by image analysis of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the dorsolateral and ventromedial putamen. Results: The common microtubule-associated protein tau H2 haplotype did not show a strong effect on pathological burden in Lewy body disease. The rare H1j haplotype (1.3%) was significantly associated with a lower dorsolateral putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (and therefore greater dopaminergic degeneration) compared to other microtubule-associated protein tau haplotypes (P = 0.0016). Microtubule-associated protein tau H1j was also nominally (P ≤ 0.05) associated with a lower ventromedial putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (P = 0.010), but this did not survive multiple testing correction. Other nominally significant associations between microtubule-associated protein tau H1 subhaplotypes and neuropathological outcomes were observed. Conclusions: A rare microtubule-associated protein tau H1 subhaplotype (H1j) may be associated with more severe putaminal dopaminergic degeneration in Lewy body disease cases. Microtubule-associated protein tau H1j has been associated previously with an increased risk of PD, and therefore our exploratory findings provide insight into the mechanism by which H1j modulates PD risk. © 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",genetics | haplotype | Lewy body disease | MAPT | neuropathology,3,0,NINDS,P50 #NS072187,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,papers by authors,5,2019-09-01

Associations between tau-PET signal in 43 brain regions and cognitive test scores were assessed using penalized linear regression. In additional models, participants were classified by normal/abnormal global amyloid-PET (A+/A-) and normal/abnormal regional tau-PET (T+/T-). Regional tau-PET cutpoints were defined as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) greater than the 95th percentile of tau-PET SUVR in that region among 117 CU participants aged 30-49.ResultsHigher tau-PET signal was associated with poorer memory performance in all medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions and also in the middle temporal pole and frontal olfactory regions. The largest association with tau-PET and memory z scores was seen in the entorhinal cortex; this association was independent of tau-PET signal in other brain regions. Tau-PET in the entorhinal cortex was also associated with poorer global and language performance.

LATE neuropathological change (LATE-NC) is defined by a stereotypical TDP-43 proteinopathy in older adults, with or without coexisting hippocampal sclerosis pathology. LATE-NC is a common TDP-43 proteinopathy, associated with an amnestic dementia syndrome that mimicked Alzheimer's-type dementia in retrospective autopsy studies. LATE is distinguished from frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology based on its epidemiology (LATE generally affects older subjects), and relatively restricted neuroanatomical distribution of TDP-43 proteinopathy. In community-based autopsy cohorts, ∼25% of brains had sufficient burden of LATE-NC to be associated with discernible cognitive impairment. Many subjects with LATE-NC have comorbid brain pathologies, often including amyloid-β plaques and tauopathy. Given that the 'oldest-old' are at greatest risk for LATE-NC, and subjects of advanced age constitute a rapidly growing demographic group in many countries, LATE has an expanding but under-recognized impact on public health. For these reasons, a working group was convened to develop diagnostic criteria for LATE, aiming both to stimulate research and to promote awareness of this pathway to dementia. We report consensus-based recommendations including guidelines for diagnosis and staging of LATE-NC. For routine autopsy workup of LATE-NC, an anatomically-based preliminary staging scheme is proposed with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on tissue from three brain areas, reflecting a hierarchical pattern of brain involvement: amygdala, hippocampus, and middle frontal gyrus. LATE-NC appears to affect the medial temporal lobe structures preferentially, but other areas also are impacted. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that subjects with LATE-NC also had atrophy in the medial temporal lobes, frontal cortex, and other brain regions. Genetic studies have thus far indicated five genes with risk alleles for LATE-NC: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, KCNMB2, and APOE. The discovery of these genetic risk variants indicate that LATE shares pathogenetic mechanisms with both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, but also suggests disease-specific underlying mechanisms. Large gaps remain in our understanding of LATE. For advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, there is an urgent need for research focused on LATE, including in vitro and animal models. An obstacle to clinical progress is lack of diagnostic tools, such as biofluid or neuroimaging biomarkers, for ante-mortem detection of LATE. Development of a disease biomarker would augment observational studies seeking to further define the risk factors, natural history, and clinical features of LATE, as well as eventual subject recruitment for targeted therapies in clinical trials.",epidemiology | FTLD | MRI | PET | SNAP,310,1,NIH,P01AG017586,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2019-06-01

We aimed to determine whether TDP-43 is associated with brain atrophy in PART. Methods: We assessed the frequency of TDP-43 in PART and performed voxel-level analysis in SPM12, as well as region-of-interest analysis using linear regression modeling, controlling for variables of interest, to assess for associations between TDP-43 and brain atrophy. Results: Of 116 PART cases, 31 (26.7%) had TDP-43. The presence of TDP-43 was associated with significantly greater amygdala, hippocampal, and anterior temporal atrophy in both the region-of-interest and the voxel level analyses.

However, the specific H1 subhaplotypes that drive the association have not been evaluated in large studies, nor have they been studied in relation to neuropathologic severity of disease. Objective: To comprehensively evaluate the associations of MAPT haplotypes with the risk of PSP and the severity of tau pathology using a large series of neuropathologically confirmed PSP cases. Design, Setting, and Participants: A case-control study was used to investigate the associations between MAPT haplotypes and the risk of PSP, and a case series was conducted for examination of associations of MAPT haplotypes with the severity of tau pathology. All 802 neuropathologically confirmed PSP cases were obtained from a neurodegenerative disorders brain bank between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2013, and 1312 clinical controls were obtained from the neurology department of the Mayo Clinic. Statistical analysis was performed from February 17 to December 12, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Presence of PSP in case-control analysis and semiquantitative tau pathology scores for neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, tufted astrocytes, and oligodendroglial coiled bodies in PSP cases. Results: For 802 patients with PSP (376 women and 426 men), the median age at death was 75 years (range, 52-98 years). For 1312 controls (701 women and 611 men), the median age at blood collection was 69 years (range, 45-92 years). After adjustment for multiple testing, known associations with risk of PSP were observed for the H2 and H1c haplotypes. Novel associations with PSP were observed for 3 H1 subhaplotypes, including H1d (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.43-2.42; P = 2 × 10-6), H1g (odds ratio, 3.64; 95% CI, 2.04-6.50; P = 2 × 10-6), and H1o (odds ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.63-4.16; P = 2 × 10-5). Although not significant after multiple testing adjustment, 3 of these PSP risk haplotypes (H2, H1c, and H1d) were also nominally associated with measures of severity of tau pathology in PSP cases. Nominally significant associations with severity of tau pathology were also noted for the H1e and H1q haplotypes. Conclusions and Relevance: This study has identified novel associations with risk of PSP for 3 MAPT H1 subhaplotypes. In addition, potential weaker associations between several haplotypes (including several PSP risk haplotypes) and severity of tau pathology were observed. These findings expand the current understanding of the role of MAPT haplotypic variation in susceptibility to and neuropathologic severity of PSP..",,17,1,NIH,P50 AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2019-06-01

Results: Hispanic decedents had a higher frequency of family history of cognitive impairment (58%), an earlier age at onset (median age of 70 years), longer disease duration (median of 12 years), and lower MMSE proximal to death (median of 4 points)compared with the other ethnoracial groups. Black decedents had a lower Braak tangle stage (stage V)and higher frequency of coexisting hippocampal sclerosis (21%); however, only hippocampal sclerosis differences survived adjustment for sex, age at onset, and disease duration. Neither Thal amyloid phase nor coexisting Lewy body disease differed across ethnoracial groups. Discussion: Despite a smaller sample size, Hispanics demonstrated longer disease duration with Alzheimer's disease, but not greater lifespan.

Eighty-six percent had at least 1 pathology, and 63% had mixed pathologies. Tau and vascular pathology were associated with poorer memory scores. Tau was also associated with poorer general cognition scores and smaller amygdala, hippocampi, and entorhinal cortex volumes. Beta-amyloid neuritic plaque burden was associated with greater depression scores. The presence of a greater number of pathologies was associated with APOE e4 carrier status and with poorer memory performance. Some dementia-related pathologies are associated with poorer performance in clinical measures and brain atrophy in the unimpaired elderly.",Brain volume | Clinically normal aging | Cognition | Depression | Neurodegenerative pathology | TDP-43 | Vascular pathology,25,0,NIH,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2019-05-01

In brain capillaries, endothelial cells are connected closely with one another through transmembrane tight junction proteins forming the blood-brain barrier. Because the blood-brain barrier tightly regulates the exchange of molecules between brain and blood and maintains brain homeostasis, its impairment is increasingly recognized as a critical factor contributing to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. However, the pathological relationship between blood-brain barrier properties and Alzheimer's disease progression in the human brain is not fully understood. In this study, we show that the loss of cortical tight junction proteins is a common event in Alzheimer's disease, and is correlated with synaptic degeneration. By quantifying the amounts of major tight junction proteins, claudin-5 and occludin, in 12 brain regions dissected from post-mortem brains of normal ageing (n = 10), pathological ageing (n = 14) and Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 19), we found that they were selectively decreased in cortical areas in Alzheimer's disease. Cortical tight junction proteins were decreased in association with the Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage. There was also a negative correlation between the amount of tight junction proteins and the amounts of insoluble Alzheimer's disease-related proteins, in particular amyloid-β 40, in cortical areas. In addition, the amount of tight junction proteins in these areas correlated positively with those of synaptic markers. Thus, loss of cortical tight junction proteins in Alzheimer's disease is associated with insoluble amyloid-β 40 and loss of synaptic markers. Importantly, the positive correlation between claudin-5 and synaptic markers, in particular synaptophysin, was present independent of insoluble amyloid-β 40, amyloid-β 42 and tau values, suggesting that loss of cortical tight junction proteins and synaptic degeneration is present, at least in part, independent of insoluble Alzheimer's disease-related proteins. Collectively, these results indicate that loss of tight junction proteins occurs predominantly in the neocortex during Alzheimer's disease progression. Further, our findings provide a neuropathological clue as to how endothelial tight junction pathology may contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis in both synergistic and additive manners to typical amyloid-β and tau pathologies.",blood-brain barrier | claudin-5 | neurovascular unit | occludin | tight junction,39,0,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,2,2019-04-01

While the LDL receptor–related protein 1 (LRP1) is a major apoE receptor in the brain, we found that its levels are associated with those of insoluble Aβ depending on APOE genotype status in postmortem AD brains. Thus, to determine the functional interaction of apoE4 and LRP1 in brain Aβ metabolism, we crossed neuronal LRP1-knockout mice with amyloid model APP/PS1 mice and APOE3–targeted replacement (APO3-TR) or APOE4-TR mice. Consistent with previous findings, mice expressing apoE4 had increased Aβ deposition and insoluble amounts of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice compared with those expressing apoE3. Intriguingly, such effects were reversed in the absence of neuronal LRP1. Neuronal LRP1 deficiency also increased detergent-soluble apoE4 levels, which may contribute to the inhibition of Aβ deposition. Together, our results suggest that apoE4 exacerbates Aβ pathology through a mechanism that depends on neuronal LRP1. A better understanding of apoE isoform–specific interaction with their metabolic receptor LRP1 on Aβ metabolism is crucial for defining APOE4-related risk for AD.",,40,1,NIH,2014NIRG304190,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2019-03-01

By translating the neuropathologic algorithm to flortaucipir PET scans, patterns of tau pathology consistent with autopsy findings, and with a similar prevalence, were identified in vivo. 6/45 (13%) participants were identified as hippocampal sparing and 6/45 (13%) as limbic predominant AD subtypes. Hippocampal sparing participants were significantly younger than those assigned to the other two subtypes.

These rare resilient cases do not demonstrate the patterns of neuronal/synaptic loss that are normally found in the brains of typical demented Alzheimer's patients. Moreover, they exhibit decreased astrocyte and microglial activation markers GFAP and CD68, suggesting that a suppressed neuroinflammatory response may be implicated in human brain resilience to Alzheimer's pathology. In the present work, we used a multiplexed immunoassay to profile a panel of 27 cytokines in the brains of controls, typical demented Alzheimer's cases, and two groups of resilient cases, which possessed pathology consistent with either high probability (HP, Braak stage V-VI and CERAD 2–3) or intermediate probability (IP, Braak state III-IV and CERAD 1–3) of Alzheimer's disease in the absence of dementia. We used a multivariate partial least squares regression approach to study differences in cytokine expression between resilient cases and both Alzheimer's and control cases. Our analysis identified distinct profiles of cytokines in the entorhinal cortex (one of the earliest and most severely affected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease) that are up-regulated in both HP and IP resilient cases relative to Alzheimer's and control cases. These cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-13, and IL-4 in HP resilient cases and IL-6, IL-10, and IP-10 in IP resilient cases, delineate differential inflammatory activity in brains resilient to Alzheimer's pathology compared to Alzheimer's cases. Of note, these cytokines all have been associated with pathogen clearance and/or the resolution of inflammation. Moreover, our analysis in the superior temporal sulcus (a multimodal association cortex that consistently accumulates Alzheimer's pathology at later stages of the disease along with overt symptoms of dementia) revealed increased expression of neurotrophic factors, such as PDGF-bb and basic FGF in resilient compared to AD cases. The same region also had reduced expression of chemokines associated with microglial recruitment, including MCP-1 in HP resilient cases and MIP-1α in IP resilient cases compared to AD. Altogether, our data suggest that different patterns of cytokine expression exist in the brains of resilient and Alzheimer's cases, link these differences to reduced glial activation, increased neuronal survival and preserved cognition in resilient cases, and reveal specific cytokine targets that may prove relevant to the identification of novel mechanisms of brain resiliency to Alzheimer's pathology.",Alzheimer's disease | Neuroinflammation | Partial least squares regression | Resilience,40,0,NIH,P01 AG025204,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,9,2019-01-01

Many estimates regarding AD, however, are based on clinical series lacking autopsy confirmation. The Florida Autopsied Multi-Ethnic (FLAME) cohort was queried for AD cases with a total of 1625 identified ranging in age from 53 to 102 years at death. Standard neuropathologic procedures were employed and clinical information was retrospectively collected. Clinicopathologic and genetic data (MAPT and APOE) were stratified by sex. Within the neuropathologically diagnosed AD cohort, the overall number of women and men did not differ. Men were younger at onset of cognitive symptoms, had a shorter disease duration, and more often had atypical (non-amnestic) clinical presentations. The frequency of autopsy-confirmed AD among women and men stratified by age at death revealed an inverse U-shaped curve in men and a U-shaped curve in women, with both curves having inflections at approximately 70 years of age. Regional counts of neurofibrillary tangles differed in women and men, especially when examined by age intervals. Women had overall greater severity of neurofibrillary tangle counts compared to men, especially in the hippocampus. Men were more often classified as hippocampal sparing AD, whereas limbic predominant AD was more common in women. Men and women did not differ in frequency of MAPT haplotype or APOE genotype. Atypical clinical presentations, younger age at onset and shorter disease duration were more frequent in men, suggesting that the lower reported frequency of AD in men may be due to more frequent atypical clinical presentations not recognized as AD.

The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ϵ4 allele is strongly associated with β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and risk of AD, but its association with TDP-43 is unknown. Objective: To determine whether the APOE ϵ4 allele is a risk factor for TDP-43. Design, Setting, Participants: This cross-sectional, genetic-histologic study analyzed APOE genotype, TDP-43 status (positive vs negative), Aβ status (positive vs negative), and tau neurofibrillary tangle stage (B0, Braak stage 0; B1, Braak stages I-II; B2, Braak stages III-IV; B3, Braak stage ≥ V). We fit structural equation models to map the association between APOE and TDP-43, Aβ, and tau, accounting for age and hippocampal sclerosis. We identified 751 participants with an AD pathological spectrum diagnosis and completed Aβ, tau, and TDP-43 data who were enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer Disease Patient Registry, or the population based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and died between May 12, 1999, and December 31, 2015. However, 13 were excluded from the analyses because of missing APOE data, leaving a total of 738 participants. Main Outcomes and Measures: Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 was the main outcome of interest. We hypothesized that the APOE ϵ4 allele would be significantly directly and indirectly associated with TDP-43. Results: The 751 study participants were older (median age [interquartile range], 87 years [51-105 years]), 395 (54%) were women, and 324 (44%) were APOE ϵ4 carriers. The patients died between May 12, 1999, and December 31, 2015. Accounting for age, Aβ, and tau, APOE ϵ4 had a direct association with TDP-43 (estimate [SE], 0.31 (0.11); P =.01). The association was present among individuals with an intermediate to high likelihood of having AD (neurofibrillary tangle stage B2/B3; n = 604 [81.8%]; estimate [SE], 0.51 [0.11]; P <.001), with a similar trend for those with a low likelihood of having AD (B1; n = 134 [18.2%]; estimate [SE], 0.54 [0.32]; P =.10). We also found an indirect association of APOE ϵ4 with TDP-43 via Aβ and tau (estimate [SE], 0.34 [0.06]; P <.001), which was similar in magnitude to the direct association and an indirect association of APOE ϵ4 with hippocampal sclerosis via TDP-43 (estimate [SE], 0.65 [0.26]; P =.01). Conclusions and Relevance: The study's findings, which mapped a system of risk factors and outcomes, showed that the APOE ϵ4 allele appears to be a risk factor for TDP-43 independently of Aβ in patients with AD.",,31,1,NIH,undefined,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2018-11-01

We identified divergent patterns of transcriptional associations for the distinct tau lesions, with the neuronal and astrocytic neuropathologies being the most different. We determined that NFT are positively associated with a brain co-expression network enriched for synaptic and PSP candidate risk genes, whereas TA are positively associated with a microglial gene-enriched immune network. In contrast, TA is negatively associated with synaptic and NFT with immune system transcripts.

Methods Six hundred fifty-two autopsy-confirmed LB disease (LBD) cases and 660 clinical controls were genotyped for APOE. In case-control analysis, LBD cases were classified into 9 different groups according to severity of both LB pathology (brainstem, transitional, diffuse) and AD pathology (low, moderate, high) to assess associations between APOE e4 and risk of different neuropathologically defined LBD subgroups in comparison to controls. In LBD cases only, we also measured LB counts from 5 cortical regions and evaluated associations with e4 according to severity of AD pathology. Results As expected, APOE e4 was associated with an increased risk of transitional and diffuse LBD in cases with moderate or high AD pathology (all odds ratios ≥3.42, all p ≤ 0.004). Of note, e4 was also associated with an increased risk of diffuse LBD with low AD pathology (odds ratio = 3.46, p = 0.001). In the low AD pathology LBD subgroup, e4 was associated with significantly more LB counts in the 5 cortical regions, independently of Braak stage and Thal phase (all p ≤ 0.002). Conclusions Our results indicate that APOE e4 is independently associated with a greater severity of LB pathology. These findings increase our understanding of the mechanism behind reported associations of e4 with risk of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease with dementia, and suggest that e4 may function as a modifier of processes that favor LB spread rather than acting directly to initiate LB pathology.",,53,0,NIH,R01-NS078086,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2018-09-01

Two genes associated with recessive, early-onset PD encode the ubiquitin (Ub) kinase PINK1 and the E3 Ub ligase PRKN/PARK2/Parkin, which together orchestrate a protective mitochondrial quality control (mitoQC) pathway. Upon stress, both enzymes cooperatively identify and decorate damaged mitochondria with phosphorylated poly-Ub (p-S65-Ub) chains. This specific label is subsequently recognized by autophagy receptors that further facilitate mitochondrial degradation in lysosomes (mitophagy). Here, we analyzed human post-mortem brain specimens and identified distinct pools of p-S65-Ub-positive structures that partially colocalized with markers of mitochondria, autophagy, lysosomes and/or granulovacuolar degeneration bodies. We further quantified levels and distribution of the ‘mitophagy tag’ in 2 large cohorts of brain samples from normal aging and Lewy body disease (LBD) cases using unbiased digital pathology. Somatic p-S65-Ub structures independently increased with age and disease in distinct brain regions and enhanced levels in LBD brain were age- and Braak tangle stage-dependent. Additionally, we observed significant correlations of p-S65-Ub with LBs and neurofibrillary tangle levels in disease. The degree of co-existing p-S65-Ub signals and pathological PD hallmarks increased in the pre-mature stage, but decreased in the late stage of LB or tangle aggregation. Altogether, our study provides further evidence for a potential pathogenic overlap among different forms of PD and suggests that p-S65-Ub can serve as a biomarker for mitochondrial damage in aging and disease.

An expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of both FTLD and motor neuron disease (MND). Dipeptide repeat polymers (DPR) are generated through repeat-associated non-ATG translation, and they aggregate in neuronal inclusions with a distribution distinct from that of TDP-43 pathology. Recent studies from animal and cell culture models suggest that DPR might be toxic, but that toxicity may differ for specific DPR. Arginine containing DPR (poly-GR and poly-PR) have the greatest toxicity and are less frequent than other DPR (poly-GP, poly-GA). A unique feature of arginine-containing DPR is their potential for post-translational modification by methyl-transferases, which produces methylarginine DPR. In this report, we explored the relationship of DPR and methylarginine to markers of neurodegeneration using quantitative digital microscopic methods in 40 patients with C9ORF72 mutations and one of three different clinicopathologic phenotypes, FTLD, FTLD-MND or MND. We find that density and distribution of poly-GR inclusions are different from poly-GA and poly-GP inclusions. We also demonstrate colocalization of poly-GR with asymmetrical dimethylarginine (aDMA) immunoreactivity in regions with neurodegeneration. Differences in aDMA were also noted by clinical phenotype. FTLD-MND had the highest burden of poly-GR pathology compared to FTLD and MND, while FTLD-MND had higher burden of aDMA than FTLD. The results suggest that poly-GR pathology is associated with toxicity and neurodegeneration.

Methods In 523 autopsy-confirmed cases of DLBD, we identified 11 patients diagnosed with CBS. For comparison, we studied 22 DLBD brains with antemortem presentation of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Given previous studies suggesting the importance of pathology in peri-Rolandic cortices in CBS, we used digital pathology to count Lewy bodies and to quantify intra-cytoplasmic and neuritic α-synuclein and phospho-tau burden in the motor cortex. Results DLBD patients with antemortem features of CBS were significantly younger at disease onset and less likely to have REM sleep behavior disorder than DLBD cases who met clinical criteria for DLB during life. Patients with DLBD manifesting as CBS had more Lewy bodies in the motor cortex than DLBD manifesting as clinically probable DLB. Three cases had concomitant progressive supranuclear palsy and 4 cases had concomitant Alzheimer disease as probable correlates of CBS. Conclusion The neuropathology underlying CBS is heterogeneous, including corticobasal degeneration, Alzheimer disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy. This study suggests that atypical variants of Lewy body disease with severe peri-Rolandic Lewy-related pathology can present clinically as CBS. Patients with DLBD who present as CBS tend to have an earlier age at onset and are less likely to have clinical features of DLB, such as dream enactment behavior during sleep, visual hallucinations, and levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. Future studies with biofluid or molecular imaging biomarkers for α-synuclein will permit better recognition of this uncommon pathologic substrate of CBS.",,19,0,NIH,P01-AG003949,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2018-07-01

Cholinergic depletion is known to be severe in DLB, even when dementia severity is mild. The nucleus basalis of Meynert serves as a primary source of cortical acetylcholine, and has a role in facilitating cortical activation and arousal. We sought to determine whether daytime sleepiness at the initial evaluation of patients with DLB was associated with neuronal loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Methods: Autopsy-confirmed patients who met clinical criteria for probable DLB at their initial evaluation and who were administered the informant-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale were included in the study (n = 40). Each patient had a dementia at baseline (80% with mild severity) and two or more features of parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, fluctuations, or probable REM sleep behavior disorder. Quantitative digital pathology of the nucleus basalis of Meynert was performed in the DLB group and in 20 non-DLB autopsy controls. Results: DLB had greater neuronal depletion in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (p < 0.0001) than pathologic controls. Sleepiness was present in 58% of the DLB group and those with daytime sleepiness had significantly lower neuron counts in the nucleus basalis of Meynert than their non-sleepy counterparts (p = 0.001). Regression modeling revealed that sleepiness was a stronger predictor of neuronal loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert than visual hallucinations, fluctuations or dementia severity (p = 0.003). Conclusions: Excessive daytime sleepiness in early DLB is indicative of a more profound loss of basal forebrain cholinergic integrity.",Basal forebrain | Epworth sleepiness scale | Fluctuations | Hypersomnolence | Parkinsonism,11,1,NIH,P50 AG16574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2018-05-01

Age-related hippocampal sclerosis May account for a significant proportion of elderly participants with amnestic dementia. Advances in molecular neuroimaging have allowed for detailed biomarker-based phenotyping, but in the absence of antemortem markers of hippocampal sclerosis, cases of mixed pathology remain problematic. We evaluated the utility of 18 F-FDG-PET to differentiate flortaucipir tau PET negative from flortaucipir positive amnestic mild cognitive impairment and dementia and used an autopsy confirmed cohort to test the hypothesis that hippocampal sclerosis might account for the observed pattern. We identified impaired participants (Clinical Dementia Rating 4 0) with amnestic presentations 5 75 years who had MRI and PET imaging with 18 F-FDG (glucose metabolism), Pittsburgh compound B (amyloid) and flortaucipir (tau) performed within a year of cognitive assessment. These were stratified into amyloid positive/negative and tau positive/negative according to the A/T/N classification scheme. Our sample included 15 amyloid and tau-positive participants, and nine tau-negative participants (five of whom were amyloid-positive). For the autopsy cohort, sequential cases with antemortem 18 F-FDG-PET were screened and those with TDP-43-negative Alzheimer’s disease (10 cases) and TDP-43-positive hippocampal sclerosis (eight cases) were included. We compared each group to controls and to each other in a voxel-based analysis, and supplemented this with a region of interest-based analysis comparing medial to inferior temporal metabolism. Tau-positive and negative cases did not differ on neuropsychological testing or structural magnetic resonance biomarkers. Tau-negative cases had focal medial temporal and posterior cingulate/retrosplenial hypometabolism regardless of amyloid status, whereas tau-positive cases had additional lateral parietal and inferior temporal involvement. The inferior/medial temporal metabolism ratio was significantly different between the groups with the tau-negative group having a higher ratio. In the autopsy series, hippocampal sclerosis cases had greater medial temporal hypometabolism than Alzheimer’s disease cases, who had more parietal and lateral/inferior temporal hypometabolism. Again, the ratio between temporal regions of interest differed significantly between groups. Two of the tau-negative patients, both of whom had an elevated inferior/medial temporal ratio, came to autopsy during the study and were found to have hippocampal sclerosis. Our finding that tau-negative amnestic mild cognitive impairment and dementia is associated with focal medial temporal and posterior cingulate hypometabolism extends prior reports in amyloid-negative cases. The inferior/medial temporal metabolism ratio can help identify tau-negative cases of amnestic dementia and May serve as a biomarker for hippocampal sclerosis.",Alzheimer’s disease | FDG-PET | Hippocampal sclerosis | Tau-PET | TDP-43,28,0,NIH,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,3,2018-04-01

Methods Eight participants with amnestic mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia were evaluated by a behavioral neurologist and had a standardized neuropsychological battery performed. All participants completed structural (MRI) and molecular (amyloid and tau PET) imaging. AD-signature thickness and adjusted hippocampal volume served as structural biomarkers, while standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) from validated regions of interest for amyloid and tau PET were used to determine molecular biomarker status. Results All participants were thought to have AD as the primary driver of their symptoms before any PET imaging. All participants had hippocampal atrophy, and 2 participants fell below the AD-signature thickness cutoff for elderly controls (2.57), with a further 3 falling below the more stringent cutoff based on young controls (2.67). Four participants were amyloid positive (SUVR >1.42), and all were tau negative (SUVR <1.33). Conclusions The participants presented here were clinically impaired, with structural imaging evidence of neurodegeneration, in the absence of any significant tau accumulation. Therefore, AD is unlikely as a cause of their clinical presentation and neurodegenerative imaging findings. Several implications are discussed, including the need to establish amyloid and tau positivity in N+ participants before enrolling them in trials of disease-modifying therapy agents for AD.",,12,0,NIH,R01AG054449,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2018-03-01

Methods: Quantitative digital pathology of limbic and neocortical α-synuclein, tau, and Aβ was assessed in 49 patients with clinically probable DLB. Regression modeling examined the unique and shared contribution of each pathology to the variance of illness duration. Results: Patients with diffuse Lewy body disease had more severe pathology of each type and a shorter duration of illness than individuals with transitional Lewy body disease. The three pathologies accounted for 25% of the total variance of duration of illness, with 19% accounted for by α-synuclein alone or in combination with tau and Aβ. When the diffuse Lewy body disease group was examined separately, α-synuclein deposition significantly exceeded that of tau and Aβ. In this model, 20% of 24% total variance in the model for duration of illness was accounted for independently by α-synuclein.

Results: We identified transcriptional coexpression networks implicated in myelination, which were lower in PSP temporal cortex (TCX) compared with AD. Some of these associations were retained even after adjustments for brain cell population changes. These TCX myelination network structures were preserved in cerebellum but they were not differentially expressed in cerebellum between AD and PSP. Myelination networks were downregulated in both AD and PSP, when compared with control TCX samples. Discussion: Downregulation of myelination networks may underlie both PSP and AD pathophysiology, but may be more pronounced in PSP.

Subcortical microinfarcts are associated with declining blood pressure (BP) in elderly individuals. OBJECTIVE To investigate BP slopes as a risk factor for microinfarcts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, 303 of 1158 individuals (26.2%) in this cohort study agreed to have an autopsy between November 1, 2004, and March 31, 2016. Cerebral microinfarcts were identified and classified as cortical or subcortical. Baseline and BP trajectories were compared for groups with no microinfarcts, subcortical microinfarcts, and cortical microinfarcts. A secondary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess associations of subcortical microinfarcts with midlife hypertension, as well as systolic and diastolic BP slopes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The presence of cerebral microinfarcts using BP slopes. RESULTS Of the 303 participants who underwent autopsy, 297 had antemortem BP measurements. Of these, 177 (59.6%) were men; mean (SD) age at death was 87.2 (5.3) years. The autopsied individuals and the group who died but were not autopsied were similar for all demographics except educational level with autopsied participants having a mean of 1 more year of education (1.06; 95% CI, 0.66-1.47 years; P <.01). Among 297 autopsied individuals with antemortem BP measurements, 47 (15.8%) had chronic microinfarcts; 30 (63.8%) of these participants were men. Thirty (63.8%) had cortical microinfarcts, 19 (40.4%) had subcortical microinfarcts, and 4 (8.5%) had only infratentorial microinfarcts. Participants with microinfarcts did not differ significantly on baseline systolic (mean difference, −1.48; 95% CI, −7.30 to 4.34; P = .62) and diastolic (mean difference of slope, −0.90; 95% CI, −3.93 to 2.13; P = .56) BP compared with those with no microinfarcts. However, participants with subcortical microinfarcts had a greater annual decline (negative slope) of systolic (mean difference of slope, 4.66; 95% CI, 0.13 to 9.19; P = .04) and diastolic (mean difference, 3.33; 95% CI, 0.61 to 6.06; P = .02) BP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Subcortical microinfarcts were associated with declining BP. Future studies should investigate whether declining BP leads to subcortical microinfarcts or whether subcortical microinfarcts are a factor leading to declining BP.",,10,1,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2018-02-01

Whether TDP-43 has any clinical or anatomical associations in AD patients with non-amnestic phenotype is unknown. Objective: To determine whether TDP-43 plays a significant role in the clinic-anatomic features of non-amnestic AD. Methods: All cases with pathologically confirmed intermediate-high probability AD from 1996-2012 were identified and retrospectively sub-classified into amnestic versus non-amnestic dementia at the time of presentation. Neurofibrillary tangle counts were performed in those with a non-amnestic presentation using thioflavin-S microscopy in the hippocampus and three neocortical regions, and all cases were subtyped into hippocampal-sparing, limbic-predominant, and typical AD pathology. TDP-43 immunoreactivity was used to assess for the presence of TDP-43. Statistical analyses helped determine whether pathologic subtype or TDP-43 was more strongly associated with clinico-imaging features. Results: Out of 172 pathologically confirmed AD cases, 36 (19%) were classified as non-amnestic. Twenty-five of these 36 (69%) had typical pathology, 0 limbic-predominant pathology, and 11 (31%) hippocampal-sparing pathology. Eleven (44%) of the 25 cases with typical pathology were TDP-43+. Of the 11 cases with hippocampal-sparing pathology, 4 (36%) were TDP-43+. There were no differences in demographic, clinical, or neuroimaging features in those with TDP-43 versus those without except for older age at onset (p = 0.02) and age at death (p = 0.02) in those with TDP-43.

The relationship of these findings to the development of AD dementia needs to be better understood. Methods: Tau-PET with AV-1451 was performed on 576 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants aged 50–94 years. The number of CUs with and without abnormal MTL regions and those with or without extra-MTL abnormalities was determined. Left and right regions were compared within each subject. Results: Of CUs, 58% (334/576) had abnormal tau-PET findings. MTL abnormalities were present in 41% (238/576) of subjects. Discussion: MTL tau-PET signal is often associated with abnormal extra-MTL tau-PET signal in CU participants and may represent neurofibrillary tangle development that could identify participants most likely to develop AD dementia. Tau-PET signal exclusively outside of the MTL is seen in 17% of CU participants and could be the initial findings in participants in different AD dementia pathways.

We evaluated the findings of tau-PET to better understand neurofibrillary tangle development as it is seen in cognitively unimpaired and impaired individuals. The evolution of Alzheimer’s disease tauopathy in cognitively unimpaired individuals needs to be examined to better understand disease pathogenesis. Tau-PET was performed in 86 cognitively impaired individuals who all had abnormal amyloid levels and 601 cognitively unimpaired individuals. Tau-PET findings were assessed for relationships with clinical diagnosis, age, and regional uptake patterns relative to Braak stage. Regional and voxel-wise analyses were performed. Topographical findings from tau-PET were characterized using hierarchical clustering and clinical characteristic-based subcategorization. In older cognitively unimpaired individuals (550 years), widespread, age-related elevated tau signal was seen among those with normal or abnormal amyloid status as compared to younger cognitively unimpaired individuals (30–49 years). More frequent regional tau signal elevation throughout the brain was seen in cognitively unimpaired individuals with abnormal versus normal amyloid. Elevated tau signal was seen in regions that are considered high Braak Stage in cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired individuals. Hierarchical clustering and clinical characteristic-based categorizations both showed different patterns of tau signal between groups such as greater tau signal in frontal regions in younger onset Alzheimer’s disease dementia participants (most of whom had a dysexecutive clinical presentation). Tau-PET signal increases modestly with age throughout the brain in cognitively unimpaired individuals and elevated tau is seen more often when amyloid brain accumulation is present. Tau signal patterns in cognitively unimpaired correspond to early Braak stage but also suggest tangle involvement in extra-medial temporal and extra-temporal regions that are considered more advanced in the Braak scheme even when amyloid negative. Our findings also suggest the possibility of widespread development of early tangle pathology rather than a pattern defined exclusively by adjacent, region-to-region spread, prior to onset of clinical symptoms. Distinct patterns of neurofibrillary tangle deposition in younger-onset Alzheimer’s disease dementia versus older-onset Alzheimer’s disease dementia provide evidence for variability in regional tangle deposition patterns and demonstrate that different disease phenotypes have different patterns of tauopathy. Pathological correlation with imaging is needed to assess the implications of these observations.",,105,1,NIH,P50 AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,7,2018-01-01

Diagnosis by MRI is generally straightforward, but lack of imaging specificity can present a diagnostic dilemma, particularly in patients with cancer. We report our experience with meningioma identification on Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET/CT. Patients who underwent PiB PET/CT from 2006 to 2015 were reviewed to identify those with intracranial tumors. Tumor types were classified by MR appearance, or by pathology when available. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) measurements of tumor PiB activity were compared across tumor types. 2472 patients underwent PiB PET/CT in the period of interest; 45 patients (1.8%) had probable or definite intracranial tumor. Tumor types were meningioma (29/45, 64%), vestibular schwannoma (7/45, 16%), pituitary macroadenoma (4/45, 9%), metastatic disease (2/45, 4%), and others (3/45, 7%). In patients with meningioma, the mean lesion SUVmax was 2.05 (SD 1.37), versus 1.00 (SD 0.42) in patients with non-meningioma tumors (p < 0.01). A receiver operating curve was created for lesion:cerebellum SUVmax ratio, with an area under the curve of 0.91 for a value of 1.68. At or above this ratio, specificity for meningioma was 100% (95% CI 79–100%) and sensitivity was 76% (95% CI 57–90%). PiB PET activity within an intracranial tumor is a highly specific and reasonably sensitive marker of meningioma.

Objective: We initiated the present retrospective study to further examine cases of meningioma that underwent AV-1451 imaging. Methods: We searched the patient records of 650 patients who had undergone AV-1451 at our institution for the keyword “meningioma” to identify potential cases. PET/CT and MRI results were visually reviewed and semi-quantitative analysis of PET was performed. A paired student’s t test was run between background and tumor standard uptake values. Fisher’s exact test was used to examine the association between AV-1451 uptake and presence of calcifications on CT. Results: We identified 12 cases of meningioma, 58% (7/12) of which demonstrated uptake greater than background using both visual analysis and tumor-to-normal cortex ratios (T/N + 1.90 ± 0.83). The paired student’s t test revealed no statistically significant difference between background and tumor standard uptake values (p = 0.09); however, cases with a T/N ratio greater than one showed statistically higher uptake in tumor tissue (p = 0.01). A significant association was noted between AV-1451 uptake and presence of calcifications (p = 0.01).

Our knowledge of atypical clinical phenotypes of AD comes from clinicopathologic studies, but with the growing use of in vivo molecular biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology, we are beginning to recognize that these syndromes may not be as rare as once thought. When a clinician is evaluating a patient whose clinical phenotype is dominated by progressive aphasia, complex visual impairment, or other neuropsychiatric symptoms with relative sparing of memory, the differential diagnosis may be broader and a confident diagnosis of an atypical form of AD may require the use of molecular biomarkers. Despite the evolving sophistication in our diagnostic tools, and the acknowledgment of atypical AD syndromes in the 2011 revised diagnostic criteria for AD, the assessment of such patients still poses substantial challenges. We use a case-based approach to review the clinical and imaging phenotypes of a series of patients with typical and atypical AD, and discuss our current approach to their evaluation.

Objectives: We quantified nigrostriatal dopaminergic integrity with image analysis of putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in 492 brains with Lewy body disease and used this pathologic endophenotype to explore possible association with PD genetic variants. Methods: The study cases had Lewy-related pathology and variable degrees of nigrostriatal degeneration. They were assigned to one of the following clinical subgroups according to their predominant clinical syndrome: parkinsonism-predominant, parkinsonism+dementia, and dementia-predominant. In addition to putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, semiquantitative scoring was used to assess substantia nigra neuronal loss. A total of 29 PD genetic risk variants were genotyped on each case. Results: When compared with controls, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was reduced in Lewy body cases in the dorsolateral (79%) and ventromedial (57%) putamen. The dorsolateral region was better preserved in dementia-predominant cases than in cases with parkinsonism. Dorsolateral putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity correlated with neuronal loss in the ventrolateral substantia nigra. Genetic analyses showed no significant association of PD risk variants with putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Conclusions: The results confirm regional differences in putaminal dopaminergic degeneration and vulnerability of nigrostriatal pathway in Lewy body disorders with parkinsonism. The lack of association with PD genetic risk variants suggests that they may not be associated with quantitative endophenotypes of nigrostriatal degeneration, but more likely related to the risk of disease per se. © 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",image analysis | Lewy body disease | Parkinson genetic risk variants | putamen | tyrosine hydroxylase,9,0,NIA,P50 NS072187,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,4,2017-11-01

TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is another protein linked to Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate whether hippocampal TDP-43 is associated with increased rates of hippocampal atrophy. Methods In this longitudinal retrospective study, we analysed post-mortem brain tissue of all individuals with an Alzheimer's disease spectrum pathological diagnosis who had antemortem head MRI scans between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2012, and who had been recruited into the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, or the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We did TDP-43 immunohistochemistry and classified individuals as follows: no TDP-43 in the amygdala or hippocampus; TDP-43 restricted to the amygdala; and TDP-43 spreading into the hippocampus. Each individual was also assigned a neurofibrillary tangle stage (B1–B3), relating to the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease. We used longitudinal FreeSurfer software and tensor-based morphometry with symmetric normalisation to calculate hippocampal volume on all serial MRI scans and used linear mixed-effects regression models to estimate associations between TDP-43 and rate of hippocampal atrophy and to assess the trajectory of TDP-43-associated atrophy. Findings We identified 298 individuals meeting the inclusion criteria, with 816 usable MRI scans (spanning 1·0–11·2 years of the disease) available for analysis. 141 individuals showed no TDP-43 in the amygdala or hippocampus, 33 had TDP-43 restricted to the amygdala, and 124 had TDP-43 in the hippocampus. Among individuals with a high likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B3; n=205), those with hippocampal TDP-43 had faster rates of hippocampal atrophy (n=103, annual volume change −4·39%, 95% CI −4·82 to −3·95; p<0·0001) than did those with amygdala-only TDP-43 (n=20, −3·29%, −4·11 to −2·46; p<0·0001; difference −1·10%, 95% CI −2·02 to −0·19; p=0·02) and those without TDP-43 (n=82, −3·11%, −3·54 to −2·68; p<0·0001; difference −1·28%, −1·88 to −0·67; p<0·0001). Among individuals with an intermediate likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B2; n=56), those with hippocampal TDP-43 had faster rates of hippocampal atrophy (n=17, annual volume change −4·05%, 95% CI −5·09 to −2·99; p<0·0001) than did those with amygdala-only TDP-43 (n=6, −1·78%, −3·04 to −0·55; p=0·004; difference −2·27%, 95% CI −3·79 to −0·67; p=0·006) and those without TDP-43 (n=33, −1·63%, −2·43 to −0·83; p=0·0002; difference −2·43%, −3·66 to −1·18; p=0·0002). Hippocampal TDP-43 was not associated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy in individuals with a low likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease (neurofibrillary tangle stage B1; n=37). The trajectory analysis suggested that increased rates of TDP-43-associated hippocampal atrophy might occur at least 10 years before death. Results were similar for FreeSurfer and tensor-based morphometry. Interpretation TDP-43 should be considered as a potential factor related to increased rates of hippocampal atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

This study evaluated associations of nominated variants from the most recent PD GWAS meta-analysis with Lewy body disease (LBD) subtype (brainstem, transitional, or diffuse) and pathologic burden of LB pathology as measured by LB counts in five cortical regions in a series of LBD cases. Methods 547 autopsy-confirmed cases of LBD were included and genotyped for 29 different GWAS-nominated PD risk variants. LB counts were measured in middle frontal (MF), superior temporal (ST), inferior parietal (IP), cingulate (CG), and parahippocampal (PH) gyri. Results None of the variants examined were significantly associated with LB counts in any brain region or with LBD subtype after correcting for multiple testing. Nominally significant (P < 0.05) associations with LB counts where the direction of association was in agreement with that observed in the PD GWAS meta-analysis were observed for variants in BCKDK/STX1B (MF, ST, IP) and SNCA (ST). Additionally, MIR4697 and BCKDK/STX1B variants were nominally associated with LBD subtype. Conclusion The lack of a significant association between PD GWAS variants and severity of LB pathology is consistent with the generally subtle association odds ratios that have been observed in disease-risk analysis. These results also suggest that genetic factors other than the susceptibility loci may determine quantitative neuropathologic outcomes in patients with LBD.",Genetics | Lewy body disease | Neuropathology | Parkinson's disease,9,0,NIA,P50-NS072187,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,6,2017-11-01

Here, we describe a patient with FTDP-17 and a novel missense mutation in exon 13 of MAPT, p.E372G. We compare clinicopathologic features of this patient to two previously unreported patients with another exon 13 mutation, p.G389R. The patient with the p.E372G mutation was a 40-year-old man with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), who subsequently developed agrammatic speech and parkinsonism. One of the FTDP-17 patients with p.G389R mutation presented at age 24 with agrammatic variant of primary progressive aphasia, and subsequently behavioral dysfunction. The other presented at age 53 with bvFTD, followed by agrammatic speech and corticobasal syndrome. Neuropathologic features of FTDP-17 due to p.E372G were similar to those of p.G389R, including tau-immunoreactive Pick body-like neuronal inclusions and swollen, tapering thread-like processes in white matter immunoreactive for 3-repeat and 4-repeat tau. Biochemical analysis of insoluble tau showed similar isoform compositions in p.E372G and p.G389R. Functional studies of the p.E372G mutation showed marked increase in tau filament formation and its reduced ability to promote microtubule assembly. Together these findings indicate that p.E372G is a pathogenic MAPT mutation that causes FTDP-17 similar to p.G389R.",frontotemporal dementia | FTDP-17 | MAPT mutations | Pick's disease | primary progressive aphasia,10,0,NIH,6AZ01,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2017-09-01

Although the levels of C9ORF72 transcripts and dipeptide-repeat proteins have already been examined thoroughly, much remains unknown about the role of RNA foci in C9ORF72-linked diseases. As such, we performed a comprehensive RNA foci study in an extensive pathological cohort of C9ORF72 expansion carriers (n = 63). We evaluated two brain regions using a newly developed computer-automated pipeline allowing recognition of cell nuclei and RNA foci (sense and antisense) supplemented by manual counting. In the frontal cortex, the percentage of cells with sense or antisense RNA foci was 26 or 12%, respectively. In the cerebellum, 23% of granule cells contained sense RNA foci and 1% antisense RNA foci. Interestingly, the highest percentage of cells with RNA foci was observed in cerebellar Purkinje cells (~70%). In general, more cells contained sense RNA foci than antisense RNA foci; however, when antisense RNA foci were present, they were usually more abundant. We also observed that an increase in the percentage of cells with antisense RNA foci was associated with a delayed age at onset in the frontal cortex (r = 0.43, p = 0.003), whereas no other associations with clinico-pathological features were seen. Importantly, our large-scale study is the first to provide conclusive evidence that RNA foci are not the determining factor of the clinico-pathological variability observed in C9ORF72 expansion carriers and it emphasizes that the distribution of RNA foci does not follow the pattern of neurodegeneration, stressing the complex interplay between different aspects of C9ORF72-related diseases.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | C9ORF72 | Frontotemporal dementia | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | Motor neuron disease | RNA foci,45,1,NIH,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,4,2017-08-01

Methods Consensus statements about PCA were developed through a detailed literature review, the formation of an international multidisciplinary working party which convened on four occasions, and a Web-based quantitative survey regarding symptom frequency and the conceptualization of PCA. Results A three-level classification framework for PCA is described comprising both syndrome- and disease-level descriptions. Classification level 1 (PCA) defines the core clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging features and exclusion criteria of the clinico-radiological syndrome. Classification level 2 (PCA-pure, PCA-plus) establishes whether, in addition to the core PCA syndrome, the core features of any other neurodegenerative syndromes are present. Classification level 3 (PCA attributable to AD [PCA-AD], Lewy body disease [PCA-LBD], corticobasal degeneration [PCA-CBD], prion disease [PCA-prion]) provides a more formal determination of the underlying cause of the PCA syndrome, based on available pathophysiological biomarker evidence. The issue of additional syndrome-level descriptors is discussed in relation to the challenges of defining stages of syndrome severity and characterizing phenotypic heterogeneity within the PCA spectrum. Discussion There was strong agreement regarding the definition of the core clinico-radiological syndrome, meaning that the current consensus statement should be regarded as a refinement, development, and extension of previous single-center PCA criteria rather than any wholesale alteration or redescription of the syndrome. The framework and terminology may facilitate the interpretation of research data across studies, be applicable across a broad range of research scenarios (e.g., behavioral interventions, pharmacological trials), and provide a foundation for future collaborative work.",Alzheimer's disease | Biomarker | Clinico-radiological syndrome | Pathophysiology | Posterior cortical atrophy,187,1,NIA,P50-AG023501,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2017-08-01

updating the previous report, which has been in widespread use for the last decade. The revised DLB consensus criteria now distinguish clearly between clinical features and diagnostic biomarkers, and give guidance about optimal methods to establish and interpret these. Substantial new information has been incorporated about previously reported aspects of DLB, with increased diagnostic weighting given to REM sleep behavior disorder and 123 iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy. The diagnostic role of other neuroimaging, electrophysiologic, and laboratory investigations is also described. Minor modifications to pathologic methods and criteria are recommended to take account of Alzheimer disease neuropathologic change, to add previously omitted Lewy-related pathology categories, and to include assessments for substantia nigra neuronal loss. Recommendations about clinical management are largely based upon expert opinion since randomized controlled trials in DLB are few. Substantial progress has been made since the previous report in the detection and recognition of DLB as a common and important clinical disorder. During that period it has been incorporated into DSM-5, as major neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies. There remains a pressing need to understand the underlying neurobiology and pathophysiology of DLB, to develop and deliver clinical trials with both symptomatic and disease-modifying agents, and to help patients and carers worldwide to inform themselves about the disease, its prognosis, best available treatments, ongoing research, and how to get adequate support.",,1228,1,NSF,1060992,National Science Foundation,papers by authors,1,2017-07-01

Protection from these ADP factors may be important for aging without significant ADP. OBJECTIVE: To identify the combined and independent protective factors for amyloid and AD-pattern neurodegeneration in a population-based sample and to test the hypothesis that ""exceptional agers"" with advanced ages do not have significant ADP because they have protective factors for amyloid and neurodegeneration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study conducted a prospective analysis of 942 elderly individuals (70-≥90 years) with magnetic resonance imaging and Pittsburgh compound B-positron emission tomography scans enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal population-based study of cognitive aging in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We operationalized ""exceptional aging"" without ADP by considering individuals 85 years or older to be without significant evidence of ADP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We evaluated predictors including demographics, APOE, intellectual enrichment, midlife risk factors (physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia), and the total number of late-life cardiac and metabolic conditions. We used multivariate linear regression models to identify the combined and independent protective factors for amyloid and AD-pattern neurodegeneration. Using a subsample of the cohort 85 years of age or older, we computed Cohen d-based effect size estimations to compare the quantitative strength of each predictor variable in their contribution with exceptional aging without ADP. RESULTS: The study participants included 423 (45%) women and the average age of participants was 79.7 (5.9) years. Apart from demographics and the APOE genotype, only midlife dyslipidemia was associated with amyloid deposition. Obesity, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac and metabolic conditions, but not intellectual enrichment, were associated with greater AD-pattern neurodegeneration. In the 85 years or older cohort, the Cohen d results showed small to moderate effects (effect sizes > 0.2) of several variables except job score and midlife hypertension in predicting exceptional aging without ADP. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The protective factors that influence amyloid and AD-pattern neurodegeneration are different. ""Exceptional aging"" without ADP may be possible with a greater number of protective factors across the lifespan but warrants further investigation.",,69,1,NIH,C06 RR018898,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2017-06-01

We analysed 52 cases with a Braak NFT tangle stage >0 and ≤IV, and a Thal phase of 0 (no beta-amyloid present). Twenty-nine (56%) were female. Median age at death was 88 years (IQR 82–92 years). Fifteen (29%) were TDP-positive (75% TDP stage I), 16 (31%) had argyrophilic grain disease and three (6%) had alpha-synuclein-positive Lewy bodies. TDP-43 inclusion when present were rare and predominantly perivascular. Of the 15 with TDP-43, three showed a moderate number of inclusions and also had hippocampal sclerosis, neuronal intranuclear inclusions and fine neurites of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Four cases (8%) had an apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE4) allele. There was a significant correlation between age at death and Braak NFT stage (r = 0.32, p = 0.02). After accounting for age at clinical examination, there were significant associations between Braak NFT stage, and WAIS-R Block Design and Trail Making Tests A and B, with higher Braak stage associated with poorer performances. Thirty of the 52 cases had completed an antemortem volumetric head MRI. Two separate MRI analyses revealed an association between higher Braak NFT stage and grey matter atrophy in the head of the left hippocampus. There were no significant clinical or radiologic associations with TDP-43. Findings from this study demonstrate that aggregated tau distribution is associated with poorer cognitive performance, as well as atrophy, in the absence of beta-amyloid. These findings support the parcellation of definite PART as a useful construct. The relatively low frequencies of APOE4, TDP-43, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis, and the rarity and morphology of TDP-43 lesions are noted contrasts to what is typically observed in Alzheimer’s disease of the old.",Alzheimer’s disease | Beta-amyloid | Cognition | Hippocampus | MRI | Neurofibrillary tangles | PART | Tauopathy | TDP-43,73,0,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2017-05-01

In physiological conditions, TDP-43 mainly localizes in the nucleus and shuttles, at least in neurons, to the cytoplasm to form TDP-43 RNA granules. In the nucleus, TDP-43 participates to the expression and splicing of RNAs, while in the cytoplasm its functions range from transport to translation of specific mRNAs. However, if loss or gain of these TDP-43 functions are affected in ALS/FTLD pathogenesis is not clear. Here, we report that TDP-43 localizes on ribosomes not only in primary neurons but also in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We find that binding of TDP-43 to the translational machinery is mediated by an interaction with a specific ribosomal protein, RACK1, and that an increase in cytoplasmic TDP-43 represses global protein synthesis, an effect which is rescued by overexpression of RACK1. Ribosomal loss of RACK1, which excludes TDP-43 from the translational machinery, remarkably reduces formation of TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions in neuroblastoma cells. Finally, we corroborate the interaction between TDP-43 and RACK1 on polyribosomes of neuroblastoma cells with mis-localization of RACK1 on TDP-43 positive cytoplasmic inclusions in motor neurons of ALS patients. In conclusions, results from this study suggest that TDP-43 represents a translational repressor not only for specific mRNAs but for overall translation and that its binding to polyribosomes through RACK1 may promote, under conditions inducing ALS pathogenesis, the formation of cytoplasmic inclusions.",,33,1,NIA,R01AG050471,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2017-04-01

Methods: MAPT mutations are associated with the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons and glia. The PET tracer [ 18 F]AV1451 binds with high affinity to paired helical filaments tau that comprises neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease (AD), while postmortem studies suggest lower or absent binding to the tau filaments of the majority of non-AD tauopathies. We describe clinical, structural MRI, and [ 18 F]AV1451 PET findings in a V337M MAPT mutation carrier affected by FTD and pathologic findings in his affected mother and in an unrelated V337M MAPT carrier also affected with FTD. The biochemical similarity between paired helical filament tau in AD and MAPT V337M predicts that the tau pathology associated with this mutation constitutes a compelling target for [ 18 F]AV1451 imaging. Results: We found a strong association between topography and degree of [ 18 F]AV1451 tracer retention in the proband and distribution of tau pathology in the brain of the proband's mother and the unrelated V337M mutation carrier. We also found a significant correlation between the degree of regional MRI brain atrophy and the extent of [ 18 F]AV1451 binding in the proband and a strong association between the proband's clinical presentation and the extent of regional brain atrophy and tau accumulation as assessed by structural brain MRI and [ 18 F]AV1451PET.

Methods: The genome-wide expression profile was investigated in brain tissue obtained from C9ORF72 expansion carriers (n = 32), patients without this expansion (n = 30), and controls (n = 20). Using quantitative real-time PCR, findings were confirmed in our entire pathologic cohort of expansion carriers (n = 56) as well as nonexpansion carriers (n = 31) and controls (n = 20). Results: Our findings were most profound in the cerebellum, where we identified 40 differentially expressed genes, when comparing expansion carriers to patients without this expansion, including 22 genes that have a homeobox (e.g., HOX genes) and/or are located within the HOX gene cluster (top hit: homeobox A5 [HOXA5]). In addition to the upregulation of multiple homeobox genes that play a vital role in neuronal development, we noticed an upregulation of transthyretin (TTR), an extracellular protein that is thought to be involved in neuroprotection. Pathway analysis aligned with these findings and revealed enrichment for gene ontology processes involved in (anatomic) development (e.g., organ morphogenesis). Additional analyses uncovered that HOXA5 and TTR levels are associated with C9ORF72 variant 2 levels as well as with intron-containing transcript levels, and thus, disease-related changes in those transcripts may have triggered the upregulation of HOXA5 and TTR. Conclusions: In conclusion, our identification of genes involved in developmental processes and neuroprotection sheds light on potential compensatory mechanisms influencing the occurrence, presentation, and/or progression of C9ORF72-related diseases.",,6,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,2,2017-01-01

Our objective was to determine the pattern of positron emission tomography (PET) tau tracer AV-1451 uptake in patients with probable DLB, compared to AD, and its relationship to β-amyloid deposition on PET. Methods: Consecutive patients with clinically probable DLB (n = 19) from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center underwent magnetic resonance imaging, AV-1451, and Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET examinations. Age- and sex-matched groups of AD dementia (n = 19) patients and clinically normal controls (n = 95) from an epidemiological cohort served as a comparison groups. Atlas- and voxel-based analyses were performed. Results: The AD dementia group had significantly higher AV-1451 uptake than the probable DLB group, and medial temporal uptake completely distinguished AD dementia from probable DLB. Patients with probable DLB had greater AV-1451 uptake in the posterior temporoparietal and occipital cortex compared to clinically normal controls, and in probable DLB, the uptake in these regions correlated with global cortical PiB uptake (Spearman rho = 0.63; p = 0.006). Interpretation: Medial temporal lobe AV-1451 uptake distinguishes AD dementia from probable DLB, which may be useful for differential diagnosis. Elevated posterior temporoparietal and occipital AV-1451 uptake in probable DLB and its association with global cortical PiB uptake suggest an atypical pattern of tau deposition in DLB.

However, little is known about the role of LRRK2 in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Aims of this study were to screen DLB patients for pathogenic LRRK2 variants and to evaluate associations between common LRRK2 variants and risk of DLB. Methods 417 clinical DLB patients and 1790 controls were included in the primary analysis. Additionally, 355 Lewy body disease patients assessed as having a high likelihood of clinical DLB based on neuropathological findings were included in secondary analysis. Seven pathogenic LRRK2 variants were assessed in patients, while 17 common LRRK2 exonic variants and 1 GWAS-nominated common LRRK2 PD-risk variant were evaluated for association with DLB. Results We identified carriers of 2 different pathogenic LRRK2 variants. One clinical DLB patient was a p.G2019S carrier, while in the pathological high likelihood DLB series there was one carrier of the p.R1441C mutation. However, examination of clinical records revealed the p.R1441C carrier to have PD with dementia. Evaluation of common variants did not reveal any associations with DLB risk after multiple testing adjustment. However, a non-significant trend similar to that previously reported for PD was observed for the protective p.N551K-R1398H-K1423K haplotype in the clinical DLB series (OR: 0.76, P = 0.061). Conclusion LRRK2 does not appear to play a major role in DLB, however further study of p.G2019S and the p.N551K-R1398H-K1423K haplotype is warranted to better understand their involvement in determining DLB risk.",Dementia with Lewy bodies | Genetics | LRRK2 | Parkinson's disease,20,0,NIH,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2016-10-01

MSA was originally considered exclusively sporadic but reports of association with genes such as SNCA, COQ2 and LRRK2 have demonstrated that there is a genetic contribution to the disease. MAPT has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and we previously reported a protective association of the MAPT H2 haplotype with MSA in 61 pathologically confirmed cases. Methods In the present study, we assessed the full MAPT haplotype diversity in MSA patients using six MAPT tagging SNPs. We genotyped a total of 127 pathologically confirmed MSA cases, 86 patients with clinically diagnosed MSA and 1312 controls. Results We identified four significant association signals in our pathologically confirmed cases, two from the protective haplotypes H2 (MSA:16.2%, Controls:22.7%, p = 0.024) and H1E (MSA:3.0%, Controls:9.0%, p = 0.014), and two from the rare risk haplotypes H1x (MSA:3.7%, Controls:1.3%, p = 0.030) and H1J (MSA:3.0%, Controls:0.9%, p = 0.021). We evaluated the association of MSA subtypes with the common protective H2 haplotype and found a significant difference with controls for MSA patients with some degree of MSA-C (MSA-C or MSA-mixed), for whom H2 occurred in only 8.6% of patients in our pathologically confirmed series (P < 0.0001). Conclusions Our findings provide further evidence that MAPT variation is associated with risk of MSA. Interestingly, our results suggest a greater effect size in the MSA-C compared to MSA-P for H2. Additional genetic studies in larger pathologically confirmed MSA series and meta-analytic studies will be needed to fully assess the role of MAPT and other genes in MSA.",Association study | Genetics | MAPT | Multiple system atrophy,14,0,NIH,U01 AG006786,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,4,2016-09-01

Methods We genotyped 302 PCA patients from 11 centers, calculated risk at 24 loci for AD/DLB and performed an exploratory genome-wide association study. Results We confirm that variation in/near APOE/TOMM40 (P = 6 × 10−14) alters PCA risk, but with smaller effect than for typical AD (PCA: odds ratio [OR] = 2.03, typical AD: OR = 2.83, P = .0007). We found evidence for risk in/near CR1 (P = 7 × 10−4), ABCA7 (P = .02) and BIN1 (P = .04). ORs at variants near INPP5D and NME8 did not overlap between PCA and typical AD. Exploratory genome-wide association studies confirmed APOE and identified three novel loci: rs76854344 near CNTNAP5 (P = 8 × 10−10 OR = 1.9 [1.5–2.3]); rs72907046 near FAM46A (P = 1 × 10−9 OR = 3.2 [2.1–4.9]); and rs2525776 near SEMA3C (P = 1 × 10−8, OR = 3.3 [2.1–5.1]).

APOE4 is a strong genetic risk factor for both AD and CAA. Sex-dependent differences have been shown in AD as well as in cerebrovascular diseases. Therefore, we examined the effects of APOE4, sex, and pathological components on CAA in AD subjects. A total of 428 autopsied brain samples from pathologically confirmed AD cases were analyzed. CAA severity was histologically scored in inferior parietal, middle frontal, motor, superior temporal and visual cortexes. In addition, subgroups with severe CAA (n = 60) or without CAA (n = 39) were subjected to biochemical analysis of amyloid-β (Aβ) and apolipoprotein E (apoE) by ELISA in the temporal cortex. After adjusting for age, Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage and Thal amyloid phase, we found that overall CAA scores were higher in males than females. Furthermore, carrying one or more APOE4 alleles was associated with higher overall CAA scores. Biochemical analysis revealed that the levels of detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble Aβ40, and insoluble apoE were significantly elevated in individuals with severe CAA or APOE4. The ratio of Aβ40/Aβ42 in insoluble fractions was also increased in the presence of CAA or APOE4, although it was negatively associated with male sex. Levels of insoluble Aβ40 were positively associated with those of insoluble apoE, which were strongly influenced by CAA status.

In 175 autopsied PSP subjects, we performed associations between seven PSP risk variants and temporal cortex levels of 20 genes in-cis, within ±100 kb. Methylation measures were collected using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing in 43 PSP brains. To determine whether SNP/expression associations are due to epigenetic modifications, CpG methylation levels of associated genes were tested against relevant variants. Quantitative neuropathology endophenotypes were tested for SNP associations in 422 PSP subjects. Brain levels of LRRC37A4 and ARL17B were associated with rs8070723; MOBP with rs1768208 and both ARL17A and ARL17B with rs242557. Expression associations for LRRC37A4 and MOBP were available in an additional 100 PSP subjects. Meta-analysis revealed highly significant associations for PSP risk alleles of rs8070723 and rs1768208 with higher LRRC37A4 and MOBP brain levels, respectively. Methylation levels of one CpG in the 3′ region of ARL17B associated with rs242557 and rs8070723. Additionally, methylation levels of an intronic ARL17A CpG associated with rs242557 and that of an intronic MOBP CpG with rs1768208. MAPT and MOBP region risk alleles also associated with higher levels of neuropathology. Strongest associations were observed for rs242557/coiled bodies and tufted astrocytes; and for rs1768208/coiled bodies and tau threads. These findings suggest that PSP variants at MAPT and MOBP loci may confer PSP risk via influencing gene expression and tau neuropathology. MOBP, LRRC37A4, ARL17A and ARL17B warrant further assessment as candidate PSP risk genes. Our findings have implications for the mechanism of action of variants at some of the top PSP risk loci.",Association | Brain tissue | Epigenetic | Genetic risk | Neuropathology traits | Progressive supranuclear palsy | Transcription,29,0,NIH,P01AG017586,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,7,2016-08-01

The ability to more accurately prognosticate survival is important. Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate hippocampal volume as a predictor of survival in dementia with Lewy bodies patients. Methods: Survival analysis for time from onset of cognitive symptoms to death was carried out using Cox proportional hazards models. Given their age and total intracranial volume, patients were dichotomized into low/medium (0%-66.7%) and high (66. 7%-100%) hippocampal volume categories. The models using these categories to predict survival were adjusted for field strength, APOE ε4 status, and estimated onset age of cognitive problems. Results: We investigated 167 consecutive patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. The median age at MRI was 72 years (interquartile range 67-76), and 80% were male. The median time from estimated first cognitive symptom to death was 7.4 years (interquartile range:5.7-10.2). Lower hippocampal volumes were significantly associated with higher risk of death (hazard ratio 1.28; 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.58; P =.024). The predicted median survival for participants with onset of cognitive symptoms at age 68 was 10.63 years (95% confidence interval 8.66-14.54) for APOE ε4 negative, high hippocampal volume participants; 8.89 years (95% confidence interval 7.56-12.36) for APOE ε4 positive, high hippocampal volume participants; 8.10 years (95% confidence interval 7.34-11.08) for APOE ε4 negative, low/medium hippocampal volume participants; and 7.38 (95% confidence interval 6.74-9.29) years for APOE ε4 positive, low/medium hippocampal volume participants. Conclusions: Among patients with clinically diagnosed dementia with Lewy bodies, those with neuroimaging evidence of hippocampal atrophy have shorter survival times. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",Dementia with Lewy bodies | MRI | Survival,22,0,NIA,K23AG030935,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2016-07-01

A brain MRI atlas representing autopsy-sampled tissue can be used to directly compare imaging and pathology findings. Our objective was to develop a brain MRI atlas representing the cortical regions that are routinely sampled at autopsy for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Subjects (n = 22; ages at death = 70-95) with a range of pathologies and antemortem 3T MRI were included. Histology slides from 8 cortical regions sampled from the left hemisphere at autopsy guided the localization of the atlas regions of interest (ROIs) on each subject's antemortem 3D T1-weighted MRI. These ROIs were then registered to a common template and combined to form one ROI representing the volume of tissue that was sampled by the pathologists. A subset of the subjects (n = 4; ages at death = 79-95) had amyloid PET imaging. Density of β-amyloid immunostain was quantified from the autopsy-sampled regions in the 4 subjects using a custom-designed ImageScope algorithm. Median uptake values were calculated in each ROI on the amyloid-PET images. RESULTS: We found an association between β-amyloid plaque density in 8 ROIs of the 4 subjects (total ROI n = 32) and median PiB SUVR (r2 = .64; P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In an atlas developed for imaging and pathologic correlation studies, we demonstrated that antemortem amyloid burden measured in the atlas ROIs on amyloid PET is strongly correlated with β-amyloid density measured on histology. This atlas can be used in imaging and pathologic correlation studies.",Alzheimer's disease | Atlas | MRI | Pathology,2,1,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2016-05-01

To investigate poly(GA) toxicity, we generated mice that exhibit poly(GA) pathology, neurodegeneration and behavioral abnormalities reminiscent of FTD and ALS. These phenotypes occurred in the absence of TDP-43 pathology and required poly(GA) aggregation. HR23 proteins involved in proteasomal degradation and proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport were sequestered by poly(GA) in these mice. HR23A and HR23B similarly colocalized to poly(GA) inclusions in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Sequestration was accompanied by an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and decreased xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) levels in mice, indicative of HR23A and HR23B dysfunction. Restoring HR23B levels attenuated poly(GA) aggregation and rescued poly(GA)-induced toxicity in neuronal cultures.

Here we use genome-wide linkage analysis in a large ALS/FTD kindred to identify a novel disease locus on chromosome 16p13.3. Whole-exome sequencing identified a CCNF missense mutation at this locus. Interrogation of international cohorts identified additional novel CCNF variants in familial and sporadic ALS and FTD. Enrichment of rare protein-altering CCNF variants was evident in a large sporadic ALS replication cohort. CCNF encodes cyclin F, a component of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex (SCFCyclin F). Expression of mutant CCNF in neuronal cells caused abnormal ubiquitination and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, including TDP-43 and a SCFCyclin F substrate.

We show that in addition to the eight original regions we previously reported [amygdala, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, occipitotemporal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, middle frontal cortex and basal ganglia (putamen/globus pallidum)] that TDP-43 is also deposited in the insular cortex, ventral striatum, basal forebrain, substantia nigra, midbrain tectum, and the inferior olive of the medulla oblongata, in Alzheimer’s disease. The conditional probability analysis produced six significantly different stages (P < 0.01), and suggests that TDP-43 deposition begins in the amygdala (stage 1), then moves to entorhinal cortex and subiculum (stage 2); to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and occipitotemporal cortex (stage 3); insular cortex, ventral striatum, basal forebrain and inferior temporal cortex (stage 4); substantia nigra, inferior olive and midbrain tectum (stage 5); and finally to basal ganglia and middle frontal cortex (stage 6). This updated staging scheme is superior to our previous staging scheme, classifying 100 % of the cases (versus 94 % in the old scheme), based on criteria provided, and shows clinical significance with some regions and with increasing stage. We discuss the relevance of the updated staging scheme, as well as its impact on the prion-like hypothesis of protein spread in neurodegenerative disease.

We performed autoradiography in autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative disorders to evaluate the specificity of AV-1451 binding for tau aggregates. Methods: Tissue samples were selected that had a variety of dementia-related neuropathologies including Alzheimer disease, primary age-related tauopathy, tangle predominant dementia, non-Alzheimer disease tauopathies, frontotemporal dementia, parkinsonism, Lewy body disease and multiple system atrophy (n = 38). Brain tissue sections were stained for tau, TAR DNA-binding protein-43, and α-synuclein and compared to AV-1451 autoradiography on adjacent sections. Results: AV-1451 preferentially localized to neurofibrillary tangles, with less binding to areas enriched in neuritic pathology and less mature tau. The strength of AV-1451 binding with respect to tau isoforms in various neurodegenerative disorders was: 3R + 4R tau (e.g., AD) > 3R tau (e.g., Pick disease) or 4R tau. Only minimal binding of AV-1451 to TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive regions was detected. No binding of AV-1451 to α-synuclein was detected. ""Off-target"" binding was seen in vessels, iron-associated regions, substantia nigra, calcifications in the choroid plexus, and leptomeningeal melanin. Conclusions: Reduced AV-1451 binding in neuritic pathology compared to neurofibrillary tangles suggests that the maturity of tau pathology may affect AV-1451 binding and suggests complexity in AV-1451 binding. Poor association of AV-1451 with tauopathies that have preferential accumulation of either 4R tau or 3R tau suggests limited clinical utility in detecting these pathologies. In contrast, for disorders associated with 3R + 4R tau, such as Alzheimer disease, AV-1451 binds tau avidly but does not completely reflect the early stage tau progression suggested by Braak neurofibrillary tangle staging. AV-1451 binding to TAR DNA-binding protein-43 or TAR DNA-binding protein-43 positive regions can be weakly positive.

Historically, hippocampal volume has been favored. Recently, ""AD signature"" measurements of gray matter (GM) volumes or cortical thicknesses have gained attention. Here, we systematically evaluate multiple thickness- and volume-based candidate-methods side-by-side, built using the popular FreeSurfer, SPM, and ANTs packages, according to the following criteria: (a) ability to separate clinically normal individuals from those with AD; (b) (extent of) correlation with head size, a nuisance covariatel (c) reliability on repeated scans; and (d) correlation with Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage in a group with autopsy. We show that volume- and thickness-based measures generally perform similarly for separating clinically normal from AD populations, and in correlation with Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage at autopsy. Volume-based measures are generally more reliable than thickness measures. As expected, volume measures are highly correlated with head size, while thickness measures are generally not. Because approaches to statistically correcting volumes for head size vary and may be inadequate to deal with this underlying confound, and because our goal is to determine a measure which can be used to examine age and sex effects in a cohort across a large age range, we thus recommend thickness-based measures. Ultimately, based on these criteria and additional practical considerations of run-time and failure rates, we recommend an AD signature measure formed from a composite of thickness measurements in the entorhinal, fusiform, parahippocampal, mid-temporal, inferior-temporal, and angular gyrus ROIs using ANTs with input segmentations from SPM12.",,107,1,NIH,W81XWH-12-2-0012,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,9,2016-01-01

Methods We retrospectively reviewed the database of the CurePSP brain bank at Mayo Clinic Florida to retrieve all available clinical information for PSP patients. All patients underwent a standard neuropathological assessment and an immunohistochemical evaluation for tau and α-synuclein. DNA was genotyped for the MAPT H1/H2 haplotype. Results Of the 375 PSP patients identified, 344 had a documented presence or absence of tremor, which included 146 (42%) with tremor, including 29 (20%) with postural/action tremors, 16 (11%) with resting tremor, 7 (5%) with intention tremor, 20 (14%) with a combination of different types of tremor, and 74 (51%) patients who had tremor at some point during their illness, but details were unavailable. The tremor severity of 96% of the patients (54/55) who had this data was minimal to mild. The probability of observing a tremor during a neurological examination during the patient's illness was estimated to be ∼22%. PSP patients with postural/action tremors and PSP patients with resting tremor responded to carbidopa-levodopa therapy more frequently than PSP patients without tremor, although the therapy response was always transient. There were no significant differences in pathological findings between the tremor groups. Conclusions Tremor is an inconspicuous feature of PSP; however, 42% (146/344) of the PSP patients in our study presented some form of tremor. Because there is no curative therapy for PSP, carbidopa/levodopa therapy should be tried for patients with postural, action, and resting tremor.",Carbidopa/levodopa therapy | MAPT H1/H2 haplotype | Neuropathology | Progressive supranuclear palsy | Tremor,10,0,NINDS,P50NS072187,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,papers by authors,10,2016-01-01

Three C9ORF72 transcript variants have been described thus far; the GGGGCC repeat is located between two non-coding exons (exon 1a and exon 1b) in the promoter region of transcript variant 2 (NM_018325.4) or in the first intron of variant 1 (NM_145005.6) and variant 3 (NM_001256054.2). We studied C9ORF72 expression in expansion carriers (n = 56) for whom cerebellum and/or frontal cortex was available. Using quantitative real-time PCR and digital molecular barcoding techniques, we assessed total C9ORF72 transcripts, variant 1, variant 2, variant 3, and intron containing transcripts [upstream of the expansion (intron 1a) and downstream of the expansion (intron 1b)]; the latter were correlated with levels of poly(GP) and poly(GA) proteins aberrantly translated from the expansion as measured by immunoassay (n = 50). We detected a decrease in expansion carriers as compared to controls for total C9ORF72 transcripts, variant 1, and variant 2: the strongest association was observed for variant 2 (quantitative real-time PCR cerebellum: median 43 %, p = 1.26e-06, and frontal cortex: median 58 %, p = 1.11e-05; digital molecular barcoding cerebellum: median 31 %, p = 5.23e-10, and frontal cortex: median 53 %, p = 5.07e-10). Importantly, we revealed that variant 1 levels greater than the 25th percentile conferred a survival advantage [digital molecular barcoding cerebellum: hazard ratio (HR) 0.31, p = 0.003, and frontal cortex: HR 0.23, p = 0.0001]. When focusing on intron containing transcripts, analysis of the frontal cortex revealed an increase of potentially truncated transcripts in expansion carriers as compared to controls [digital molecular barcoding frontal cortex (intron 1a): median 272 %, p = 0.003], with the highest levels in patients pathologically diagnosed with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In the cerebellum, our analysis suggested that transcripts were less likely to be truncated and, excitingly, we discovered that intron containing transcripts were associated with poly(GP) levels [digital molecular barcoding cerebellum (intron 1a): r = 0.33, p = 0.02, and (intron 1b): r = 0.49, p = 0.0004] and poly(GA) levels [digital molecular barcoding cerebellum (intron 1a): r = 0.34, p = 0.02, and (intron 1b): r = 0.38, p = 0.007]. In summary, we report decreased expression of specific C9ORF72 transcripts and provide support for the presence of truncated transcripts as well as pre-mRNAs that may serve as templates for RAN translation.

Here, we found that ATP synthase subunit a (ATP5A) was O-GlcNAcylated at Thr432 and ATP5A O-GlcNAcylationwas decreased in the brains of AD patients and transgenic mouse model, aswell as Aβ-treated cells. Indeed, Aβ bound to ATP synthase directly and reduced the O-GlcNAcylation of ATP5A by inhibition of direct interaction between ATP5A and mitochondrial O-GlcNAc transferase, resulting in decreasedATP production and ATPase activity. Furthermore, treatment of O-GlcNAcase inhibitor rescued the Aβ-induced impairment in ATP production and ATPase activity.

Methods: In this case-control study, we screened a large global series of patients and controls, and assessed associations between p.A152T and disease risk. We included 3,229 patients with clinical Parkinson disease (PD), 442 with clinical dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 181 with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 832 with pathologically confirmed Lewy body disease (LBD), and 2,456 healthy controls. Results: The minor allele frequencies (MAF) in clinical PD cases (0.28%) and in controls (0.2%) were not found to be significantly different (odds ratio [OR] 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-2.98, p 0.42). However, a significant association was observed with clinical DLB (MAF 0.68%, OR 5.76, 95% CI 1.62-20.51, p 0.007) and LBD (MAF 0.42%, OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.04-12.17, p 0.04). Additionally, p.A152T was more common in patients with MSA compared to controls (MAF 0.55%, OR 4.68, 95% CI 0.85-25.72, p 0.08) but this was not statistically significant and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that MAPT p.A152T is a rare low penetrance variant likely associated with DLB that may be influenced by coexisting LBD and AD pathology. Given the rare nature of the variant, further studies with greater sample size are warranted and will help to fully explain the role of p.A152T in the pathogenesis of the synucleinopathies.",,24,0,NIA,P50 #NS072187,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2015-11-01

Methods We identified all cases with pathologically confirmed AD (NIA-Reagan intermediate-high probability, Braak stage IV-VI) independent of cognitive status (n = 188). Neurofibrillary tangle counts were performed using thioflavin-S microscopy in hippocampus and three neocortical regions, and all cases were subtyped: HpSp AD pathology (n = 19); typical AD pathology (n = 136); and limbic AD pathology (n = 33). TDP-43 immunoreactivity was performed in multiple brain regions to assess for the presence of TDP-43 and TDP-43 stage. All cases were clinically subclassified at presentation as amnestic AD dementia versus atypical AD dementia. Statistical analysis was performed using linear and penalized logistic regression to assess associations with pathological subtype, and the effects of TDP-43, accounting for possible interactions between pathological subtype and TDP-43. Results TDP-43 deposition was frequent in typical (59%) and limbic AD pathologies (67%), but not HpSp AD pathology (21%; p = 0.003). The observed associations of TDP-43 with greater memory loss, naming and functional decline, and smaller hippocampal volumes, closest to death, did not differ across AD pathological subtype. Clinical presentation was associated with pathological subtype (p = 0.01), but not TDP-43 (p = 0.69). Interpretation Although the frequency of TDP-43 deposition in AD varies by pathological subtype, the observed effects of TDP-43 on clinical/magnetic resonance imaging features are consistent across pathological subtypes. Clinical presentation in AD is driven by pathological subtype, not by TDP-43.",,59,0,NIA,P50-AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,2,2015-11-01

To gain insight on the molecular basis for the heterogeneity among C9ORF72 mutation carriers, we evaluated associations between features of disease and levels of two abundantly expressed “c9RAN proteins” produced by repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation of the expanded repeat. For these studies, we took a departure from traditional immunohistochemical approaches and instead employed immunoassays to quantitatively measure poly(GP) and poly(GA) levels in cerebellum, frontal cortex, motor cortex, and/or hippocampus from 55 C9ORF72 mutation carriers [12 patients with ALS, 24 with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and 19 with FTLD with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND)]. We additionally investigated associations between levels of poly(GP) or poly(GA) and cognitive impairment in 15 C9ORF72 ALS patients for whom neuropsychological data were available. Among the neuroanatomical regions investigated, poly(GP) levels were highest in the cerebellum. In this same region, associations between poly(GP) and both neuropathological and clinical features were detected. Specifically, cerebellar poly(GP) levels were significantly lower in patients with ALS compared to patients with FTLD or FTLD-MND. Furthermore, cerebellar poly(GP) associated with cognitive score in our cohort of 15 patients. In the cerebellum, poly(GA) levels similarly trended lower in the ALS subgroup compared to FTLD or FTLD-MND subgroups, but no association between cerebellar poly(GA) and cognitive score was detected. Both cerebellar poly(GP) and poly(GA) associated with C9ORF72 variant 3 mRNA expression, but not variant 1 expression, repeat size, disease onset, or survival after onset. Overall, these data indicate that cerebellar abnormalities, as evidenced by poly(GP) accumulation, associate with neuropathological and clinical phenotypes, in particular cognitive impairment, of C9ORF72 mutation carriers.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | C9ORF72 repeat expansion | c9RAN proteins | Cognition | Dipeptide repeat proteins | Frontotemporal dementia | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | Neuropathological diagnosis | Repeat-associated non-ATG translation,62,1,NIH,ALSRP AL130125,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2015-10-01

This MAPT mutation induces alternative splicing of exon 10, resulting in a modification of microtubule-binding region of tau. Although mutations in the MAPT gene have been linked to multiple tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy, knowledge regarding how tau N279K mutation causes PPND/FTDP-17 is limited. Results: We investigated the underlying disease mechanism associated with the N279K tau mutation using PPND/FTDP-17 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and autopsy brains. In iPSC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs), the N279K tau mutation induced an increased ratio of 4-repeat to 3-repeat tau and accumulation of stress granules indicating elevated cellular stress. More significant, NSCs derived from patients with the N279K tau mutation displayed impaired endocytic trafficking as evidenced by accumulation of endosomes and exosomes, and a reduction of lysosomes. Since there were no significant differences in cellular stress and distribution of subcellular organelles between control and N279K skin fibroblasts, N279K-related vesicle trafficking defects are likely specific to the neuronal lineage. Consistently, the levels of intracellular/luminal vesicle and exosome marker flotillin-1 were significantly increased in frontal and temporal cortices of PPND/FTDP-17 patients with the N279K tau mutation, events that were not seen in the occipital cortex which is the most spared cortical region in the patients.

Repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) and mutations in progranulin (GRN) are the major known genetic causes of FTLD-TDP; however, the genetic etiology in the majority of FTLD-TDP remains unexplained. In this study, we performed whole-genome sequencing in 104 pathologically confirmed FTLD-TDP patients from the Mayo Clinic brain bank negative for C9ORF72 and GRN mutations and report on the contribution of rare single nucleotide and copy number variants in 21 known neurodegenerative disease genes. Interestingly, we identified 5 patients (4.8 %) with variants in optineurin (OPTN) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) that are predicted to be highly pathogenic, including two double mutants. Case A was a compound heterozygote for mutations in OPTN, carrying the p.Q235* nonsense and p.A481V missense mutation in trans, while case B carried a deletion of OPTN exons 13-15 (p.Gly538Glufs*27) and a loss-of-function mutation (p.Arg117*) in TBK1. Cases C–E carried heterozygous missense mutations in TBK1, including the p.Glu696Lys mutation which was previously reported in two amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and is located in the OPTN binding domain. Quantitative mRNA expression and protein analysis in cerebellar tissue showed a striking reduction of OPTN and/or TBK1 expression in 4 out of 5 patients supporting pathogenicity in these specific patients and suggesting a loss-of-function disease mechanism. Importantly, neuropathologic examination showed FTLD-TDP type A in the absence of motor neuron disease in 3 pathogenic mutation carriers. In conclusion, we highlight TBK1 as an important cause of pure FTLD-TDP, identify the first OPTN mutations in FTLD-TDP, and suggest a potential oligogenic basis for at least a subset of FTLD-TDP patients. Our data further add to the growing body of evidence linking ALS and FTD and suggest a key role for the OPTN/TBK1 pathway in these diseases.",FTLD-TDP | Oligogenic mechanism | OPTN | TBK1 | Whole-genome sequencing,200,0,NIH,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,4,2015-07-01

We report clinical and pathologic findings of a family with ALS due to a truncating mutation, p.Gly141X, in copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). The proband presented clinically with FTD and later showed progressive motor neuron disease, while all other family members had early-onset and rapidly progressive ALS without significant cognitive deficits. Pathologic examination of both the proband and her daughter revealed degeneration of corticospinal tracts and motor neurons in brain and spinal cord compatible with ALS. On the other hand, the proband also had neocortical and limbic system degeneration with pleomorphic neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. Extramotor pathology in her daughter was relatively restricted to the hypothalamus and extrapyramidal system, but not the neocortex. The inclusions in the proband and her daughter were immunoreactive for SOD1, but negative for TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43). In the proband, a number of the neocortical inclusions were immunopositive for α-internexin, initially suggesting a diagnosis of atypical FTLD, but there was no evidence of fused in sarcoma (FUS) immunoreactivity, which is often detected in atypical FTLD. Analogous to atypical FTLD, neuronal inclusions had variable co-localization of SOD1 and α-internexin. The current classification of FTLD is based on the major constituent protein: FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP-43, and FTLD-FUS. The proband in this family indicates that SOD1, while rare, can also be the substrate of FTLD, in addition to the more common presentation of ALS.

Amyloid biomarkers (positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid) were included in clinical diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease dementia published by the National Institute of Ageing-Alzheimer's Association and the International Work group. Our first goal was to evaluate the correspondence of Thal amyloid phase to Braak tangle stage and ante-mortem clinical characteristics in a large autopsy cohort. Second, we examined the relevance of Thal amyloid phase in a prospectively-followed autopsied cohort who underwent ante-mortem 11C-Pittsburgh compound B imaging; using the large autopsy cohort to broaden our perspective of 11C-Pittsburgh compound B results. The Mayo Clinic Jacksonville Brain Bank case series (n = 3618) was selected regardless of ante-mortem clinical diagnosis and neuropathologic co-morbidities, and all assigned Thal amyloid phase and Braak tangle stage using thioflavin-S fluorescent microscopy. 11C-Pittsburgh compound B studies from Mayo Clinic Rochester were available for 35 participants scanned within 2 years of death. Cortical 11C-Pittsburgh compound B values were calculated as a standard uptake value ratio normalized to cerebellum grey/white matter. In the high likelihood Alzheimer's disease brain bank cohort (n = 1375), cases with lower Thal amyloid phases were older at death, had a lower Braak tangle stage, and were less frequently APOE-ε4 positive. Regression modelling in these Alzheimer's disease cases, showed that Braak tangle stage, but not Thal amyloid phase predicted age at onset, disease duration, and final Mini-Mental State Examination score. In contrast, Thal amyloid phase, but not Braak tangle stage or cerebral amyloid angiopathy predicted 11C-Pittsburgh compound B standard uptake value ratio. In the 35 cases with ante-mortem amyloid imaging, a transition between Thal amyloid phases 1 to 2 seemed to correspond to 11C-Pittsburgh compound B standard uptake value ratio of 1.4, which when using our pipeline is the cut-off point for detection of clear amyloid-positivity regardless of clinical diagnosis. Alzheimer's disease cases who were older and were APOE-ε4 negative tended to have lower amyloid phases. Although Thal amyloid phase predicted clinical characteristics of Alzheimer's disease patients, the pre-mortem clinical status was driven by Braak tangle stage. Thal amyloid phase correlated best with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B values, but not Braak tangle stage or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The 11C-Pittsburgh compound B cut-off point value of 1.4 was approximately equivalent to a Thal amyloid phase of 1-2.",Alzheimer's disease | Braak tangle stage | neuropathology | Pittsburgh compound B | Thal amyloid phase,211,1,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,2,2015-05-01

These disorders remain incurable, and a greater understanding of the pathologic processes is needed for effective treatment strategies to be developed. Recent data suggest that pathogenic misfolding of the presynaptic protein, α-synuclein (α-syn), and subsequent aggregation and accumulation are fundamental to the disease process. It is hypothesized that the misfolded isoform is able to induce misfolding of normal endogenous α-syn, much like what occurs in the prion diseases. Recent work highlighting the seeding effect of pathogenic α-syn has largely focused on the detergent-insoluble species of the protein. In this study, we performed intracerebral inoculations of the sarkosyl-insoluble or sarkosyl-soluble fractions of human Lewy body disease brain homogenate and show that both fractions induce CNS pathology in mice at 4 months after injection. Disease-associated deposits accumulated both near and distal to the site of the injection, suggesting a cell-to-cell spread via recruitment of α-syn.

HpScl has been hypothesized to be a neurodegenerative process given its association with TDP-43 pathology, but this is still controversial. TDP-43 pathology is found in Lewy body disease (LBD), but no study has focused on the pathologic and genetic characteristics of HpScl in LBD. We found HpScl in 5.2 % of 669 LBD cases (289 transitional and 380 diffuse). Older age, higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage, and presence of TDP-43 pathology were associated with HpScl. There was no difference in the frequency of HpScl between transitional and diffuse LBD, suggesting that Lewy-related pathology appears to have no direct association with HpScl. All HpScl cases had TDP-43 pathology consistent with Type A pattern. HpScl cases harbored genetic variation in TMEM106B that has been previously associated with FTLD-TDP. Interestingly, the severity of TDP-43-positive fine neurites in CA1 sector, a possible pathologic precursor of HpScl, was associated with the TMEM106B variant. These results demonstrate HpScl in LBD is a TDP-43 proteinopathy and is similar to FTLD-TDP Type A. Furthermore, a subset of LBD cases without HpScl (“pre-HpScl”) had similar pathologic and genetic characteristics to typical HpScl, suggesting that the spectrum of HpScl pathology may be wider than previously thought. Some cases with many extracellular NFTs also had a similar profile. We suggest that HpScl is “masked” in these cases.",Hippocampal sclerosis | Lewy body disease | Neuropathology | TDP-43 | TMEM106B,43,0,NIH,P01AG003949,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,9,2015-01-01

Seventeen common LRRK2 exonic variants were genotyped and assessed for association withMSA. Results: In the combined series of 177 patients with pathologically confirmed MSA and 768 controls, there was a significant association between LRRK2 p.M2397T and MSA (odds ratio [OR] = 0.60, p = 0.002). This protective effect was observed more strongly in the US series (OR = 0.46, p = 0.0008) than the UK series (OR = 0.82, p = 0.41). We observed other noteworthy associations with MSA for p.G1624G (OR = 0.63, p = 0.006) and p.N2081D (OR = 0.15, p = 0.010).

Results were consistent when additionally including the US patients with clinical MSA, where the strongest singlevariant association was again observed for p.M2397T (OR = 0.59, p = 0.0005). Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that LRRK2 exonic variants may contribute to susceptibility to MSA.

However with the recent emergence of advanced imaging technologies, imaging indicators of disease that closely reflect the underlying pathology have been found to be very useful in aiding the prediction of the underlying dementia pathology.

Repeat expansions, also present in other neurodegenerative diseases, have been shown to alter epigenetic mechanisms and consequently lead to decreased gene expression, while also leading to toxic RNA gain-of-function. As expression of multiple C9orf72 transcript variants is known to be reduced in c9FTD/ALS cases, our group and others have sought to uncover the mechanisms causing this reduction. We recently demonstrated that histones H3 and H4 undergo trimethylation at lysines 9 (H3K9), 27 (H3K27), 79 (H3K79), and 20 (H4K20) in all pathogenic repeat carrier brain samples, confirming the role of altered histone methylation in disease. It was also reported that about 40% of c9ALS cases show hypermethylation of the CpG island located at the 5' end of the repeat expansion in blood, frontal cortex, and spinal cord. To determine whether the same CpG island is hypermethylated in the cerebella of cases in whom aberrant histone methylation has been identified, we bisulfite-modified the extracted DNA and PCR-amplified 26 CpG sites within the C9orf72 promoter region. Among the ten c9FTD/ALS (4 c9ALS, 6 c9FTD), nine FTD/ALS, and eight disease control samples evaluated, only one c9FTD sample was found to be hypermethylated within the C9orf72 promoter region. This study is the first to report cerebellar hypermethylation in c9FTD/ALS, and the first to identify a c9FTD patient with aberrant DNA methylation. Future studies will need to evaluate hypermethylation of the C9orf72 promoter in a larger cohort of c9FTD patients, and to assess whether DNA methylation variation across brain regions reflects disease phenotype.

Several transgenic mouse models expressing tau mutations have been tested extensively for memory or motor impairments, though reports of amygdala-dependent behaviors are lacking. To this end, we tested the rTg4510 mouse model on a behavioral battery that included amygdala-dependent tasks of exploration. As expected, rTg4510 mice exhibit profound impairments in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tests, including contextual fear conditioning. However, rTg4510 mice also display an abnormal hyperexploratory phenotype in the open-field assay, elevated plus maze, light-dark exploration, and cued fear conditioning, indicative of amygdala dysfunction. Furthermore, significant tau burden is detected in the amygdala of both rTg4510 mice and human FTDP-17 patients, suggesting that the rTg4510 mouse model recapitulates the behavioral disturbances and neurodegeneration of the amygdala characteristic of FTDP-17. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Amygdala | Frontotemporal dementia | Neurodegeneration | Tau | Tauopathy,30,0,NIA,R01AG026251,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2014-07-01

Methods: Patients with microinfarcts (n = 22) and patients without microinfarcts (n = 44) who underwent antemortem MRI were identified from a dementia clinic-based, population-based, and community clinic-based autopsy cohort. The microinfarct and no-microinfarct groups were matched on age at MRI, age at death, sex, APOE status, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Brain infarcts were assessed on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. White matter hyperintensities on FLAIR MRI and hippocampal volumes on T1-weighted MRI were quantified using automated methods. A subset of subjects with microinfarcts (n = 15) and a matched group of subjects without microinfarcts (n = 15) had serial T1-weighted MRIs and were included in an analysis of global and regional brain atrophy rates using automated methods. Results: The presence of cortical (p = 0.03) and subcortical (p = 0.02) infarcts on antemortem MRI was associated with presence of microinfarcts at autopsy. Higher numbers of cortical (p = 0.05) and subcortical (p = 0.03) infarcts on antemortem MRI were also associated with presence of microinfarcts. Presence of microinfarcts was not associated with white matter hyperintensities and cross-sectional hippocampal volume on antemortem MRI. Whole-brain and regional precuneus, motor, and somatosensory atrophy rates were higher in subjects with microinfarcts compared to subjects without microinfarcts. Conclusions: Microinfarcts increase brain atrophy rates independent of Alzheimer disease pathology. Association between microinfarct pathology and macroinfarcts on MRI suggests either common risk factors or a shared pathophysiology and potentially common preventive targets. © 2014 American Academy of Neurology.",,36,0,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,4,2014-06-01

Unlike the characteristic finding of antemortem cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease patients, individuals with pathological aging usually lack cognitive impairment despite similar Aβ senile plaque burdens. It has been hypothesized that protective or resistance factors may underlie pathological aging, thus minimizing or preventing deleterious effects on cognition. Despite increasing interest and recognition, a review of the literature remains challenging given the range of terms used to describe pathological aging. This debate briefly reviews neuropathologic and biochemical evidence that pathological aging individuals have resistance factors to Aβ plaque pathology. Additionally, we will discuss evidence of pathological aging as an intermediate between normal individuals and Alzheimer's disease patients, and discuss protective or resistance factors against vascular disease and neurofibrillary pathology. Lastly, we will emphasize the need for longitudinal biomarker evidence using amyloid positron emission tomography, which will provide a better understanding of the kinetics of Aβ deposition in pathological aging. © 2014 Murray and Dickson; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,17,1,NIH,P50 AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2014-05-01

Methods: We assessed 81 participants with PCA diagnosed clinically and 54 with neuropathologic diagnosis of posterior AD vs 2,523 controls for association with 11 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from published LOAD risk genome-wide association studies. Results: There was highly significant association with APOE ε4 and increased risk of PCA (p = 0.0003, odds ratio [OR] = 3.17) and posterior AD (p = 1.11 × 10 <sup>-17</sup>, OR = 6.43).

Two patterns of TDP-43 deposition in AD have been described involving hippocampus (limbic) or hippocampus and neocortex (diffuse), although focal amygdala involvement has been observed. In 195 AD cases with TDP-43, we investigated regional TDP-43 immunoreactivity with the aim of developing a TDP-43 in AD staging scheme. TDP-43 immunoreactivity was assessed in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, hippocampal dentate gyrus, occipitotemporal, inferior temporal and frontal cortices, and basal ganglia. Clinical, neuroimaging, genetic and pathological characteristics were assessed across stages. Five stages were identified: stage I showed scant-sparse TDP-43 in the amygdala only (17 %); stage II showed moderate-frequent amygdala TDP-43 with spread into entorhinal and subiculum (25 %); stage III showed further spread into dentate gyrus and occipitotemporal cortex (31 %); stage IV showed further spread into inferior temporal cortex (20 %); and stage V showed involvement of frontal cortex and basal ganglia (7 %). Cognition and medial temporal volumes differed across all stages and progression across stages correlated with worsening cognition and medial temporal volume loss. Compared to 147 AD patients without TDP-43, only the Boston Naming Test showed abnormalities in stage I. The findings demonstrate that TDP-43 deposition in AD progresses in a stereotypic manner that can be divided into five distinct topographic stages which are supported by correlations with clinical and neuroimaging features. Given these findings, we recommend sequential regional TDP-43 screening in AD beginning with the amygdala. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Alzheimer disease | Amygdala | MRI | Staging | TDP-43 | TDP-43 type,186,0,NIA,P01AG003949,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,3,2014-03-01

Alternative splicing of MAPT pre-mRNA generates six major tau isoforms in the adult central nervous system resulting in tau proteins with three or four microtubule-binding repeat domains. In a group of neurodegenerative disorders called tauopathies, tau becomes aberrantly hyperphosphorylated and dissociates from microtubules, resulting in a progressive accumulation of intracellular tau aggregates. The spectrum of sporadic frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with tau pathology includes progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and Pick's disease. Alzheimer's disease is considered the most prevalent tauopathy. This review is divided into two broad sections. In the first section we discuss the molecular classification of sporadic tauopathies, with a focus on describing clinicopathologic relationships. In the second section we discuss the neuroimaging methodologies that are available for measuring tau pathology (directly using tau positron emission tomography ligands) and tau-mediated neuronal injury (magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography). Both sections have detailed descriptions of the following neurodegenerative dementias - Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and Pick's disease. © 2014 BioMed Central Ltd.",,70,1,NIH,K99-AG37573,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,8,2014-01-01

Recently, OPTN immunoreactivity has been reported in intranuclear inclusions in patients with neuronal intranuclear inclusions disease (NIID). Other studies have shown that the RNA-binding protein, fused in sarcoma (FUS), is a component of intranuclear inclusions in NIID. We aimed to investigate the relationship between OPTN, its binding protein MYO6 and FUS in this study. In control subjects, OPTN (C-terminal) (OPTN-C) and MYO6 immunoreactivity was mainly demonstrated in the cytoplasm of neurons. In NIID patients, both neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) and glial intranuclear inclusions (GII) were immunopositive for MYO6 as well as OPTN-C. However, the intensity of OPTN-C immunostaining of the neuronal cytoplasm with and without NII was less than that of the control subjects. Double immunofluorescence staining for OPTN-C, ubiquitin (Ub), p62 and FUS revealed co-localization of these proteins within NII. Moreover, Ub positive inclusions were co-localized with MYO6. The percentage of co-localization of Ub with OPTN-C, FUS or MYO6 in NII was 100%, 52% and 92%, respectively. Ultrastructurally, the inclusions consisted of thin and thick filaments. Both filaments were immunopositive for Ub and OPTN-C.

To complicate matters, a subset has concomitant HpScl and AD (HpScl-AD). We examined a large cohort of autopsy-confirmed cases of HpScl, HpScl-AD, LP-AD, and typical AD to identify distinct clinical, genetic, and pathologic characteristics. HpScl cases were significantly older at death and had a substantially slower rate of cognitive decline than the AD subtypes. Genetic analysis revealed that the AD groups (AD, LP-AD, and HpScl-AD) were more likely to be APOE ε4 carriers. In contrast, the HpScl groups (HpScl and HpScl-AD) were more likely to exhibit genetic variants in GRN and TMEM106B that are associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The HpScl groups had a high frequency of TDP-43 pathology that was most often Type A morphology and distribution, while typical AD and LP-AD had a significantly lower frequency of TDP-43 pathology that was most often Type B.

Some of these AD cases have TDP-43 immunoreactivity in basal ganglia (BG) and substantia nigra (SN), regions that when affected can be associated with parkinsonian signs or symptoms, or even features suggestive of frontotemporal dementia. Here, we examined the presence of clinical features of FTLD, parkinsonian signs and symptoms, and BG atrophy on MRI, in 51 pathologically confirmed AD cases (Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage IV-VI) with widespread TDP-43 deposition, with and without BG and SN involvement. All 51 cases had presented with progressive cognitive impairment with prominent memory deficits. None of the patients demonstrated early behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, stereotyped behavior, hyperorality, and/or executive deficits. Furthermore, TDP-43 deposition in BG or SN had no significant association with tremor (p = 0.80), rigidity (p = 0.19), bradykinesia (p = 0.19), and gait/postural instability (p = 0.39). Volumes of the BG structures were not associated with TDP-43 deposition in the BG.

This paper presents an original method of image analysis and stratification of amyloid-related brain disease based on the global spatial correlation of PiB PET images with 18F-FDG PET images (without MR images) to categorize the PiB signal arising from the cortex. Rigid registration of PiB and 18F-FDG images is relatively straightforward, and in registration the 18F-FDG signal serves to identify the cortical region in which the PiB signal is relevant. Cortical grey matter demonstrates the highest levels of amyloid accumulation and therefore the greatest PiB signal related to amyloid pathology. The highest intensity voxels in the 18F-FDG image are attributed to the cortical grey matter. The correlation of the highest intensity PiB voxels with the highest 18F-FDG values indicates the presence of I-amyloid protein in the cortex in disease states, while correlation of the highest intensity PiB voxels with mid-range 18F-FDG values indicates only nonspecific binding in the white matter. © 2014 SPIE.",Alzheimer's disease | Joint histogram | Lewy body disease | PET imaging | PiB | β-amyloid plaques,1,0,,AG16976-15,,papers by authors,13,2014-01-01

FUS is a member of the FET protein family that includes Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) and TATA-binding protein-associated factor 2N (TAF15). FET proteins are predominantly localized to the nucleus, where they bind RNA and DNA to modulate transcription, mRNA splicing, and DNA repair. In ALS cases with FUS inclusions (ALS-FUS), mutations in the FUS gene cause disease, whereas FTLD cases with FUS inclusions (FTLD-FUS) do not harbor FUS mutations. Notably, in FTLD-FUS, all FET proteins accumulate with their nuclear import receptor Transportin 1 (TRN1), in contrast ALS-FUS inclusions are exclusively positive for FUS. In the present study, we show that induction of DNA damage replicates several pathologic hallmarks of FTLD-FUS in immortalized human cells and primary human neurons and astrocytes. Treatment with the antibiotic calicheamicin γ1, which causes DNA double-strand breaks, leads to the cytoplasmic accumulation of FUS, TAF15, EWS, and TRN1. Moreover, cytoplasmic translocation of FUS is mediated by phosphorylation of its N terminus by the DNA-dependent protein kinase. Finally, we observed elevated levels of phospho-H2AX in FTLD-FUS brains, indicating that DNA damage occurs in patients. Together, our data reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for FUS localization in cells and suggest that DNA damage may contribute to the accumulation of FET proteins observed in human FTLD-FUS cases, but not in ALS-FUS. © 2014 the authors.",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) | Cytoplasmic translocation | DNA damage | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) | Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) | Phosphorylation,77,1,NIA,P50AG032362,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,14,2014-01-01

Three-hundred and forty-two subjects pathologically diagnosed with AD were screened for the presence, burden and distribution of TDP-43. All had been classified as cognitively impaired or normal, prior to death. Atlas-based parcellation and voxel-based morphometry were used to assess regional atrophy on MRI. Regression models controlling for age at death, apolipoprotein ε4 and other AD-related pathologies were utilized to explore associations between TDP-43 and cognition or brain atrophy, stratified by Braak stage. In addition, we determined whether the effects of TDP-43 were mediated by hippocampal sclerosis. One-hundred and ninety-five (57 %) cases were TDP-positive. After accounting for age, apolipoprotein ε4 and other pathologies, TDP-43 had a strong effect on cognition, memory loss and medial temporal atrophy in AD. These effects were not mediated by hippocampal sclerosis. TDP-positive subjects were 10× more likely to be cognitively impaired at death compared to TDP-negative subjects. Greater cognitive impairment and medial temporal atrophy were associated with greater TDP-43 burden and more extensive TDP-43 distribution. TDP-43 is an important factor in the manifestation of the clinico-imaging features of AD. TDP-43 also appears to be able to overpower what has been termed resilient brain aging. TDP-43 therefore should be considered a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of AD. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.",Alzheimer disease | APOE ε4 | Braak stage | MRI | Resilience | TDP-43,202,0,NIH,P50-Ag016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,15,2014-01-01

We explored differences between familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease that might shed light on their respective pathogenic mechanisms. To this end, we analysed 12 brain regions, including neocortical, limbic and subcortical areas, from post-mortem brains of familial Alzheimer's disease (n = 10; age at death: 50.0 ± 8.6 years) with mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or presenilin 1 (PSEN1), sporadic Alzheimer's disease (n = 19; age at death: 84.7 ± 7.8 years), neurologically normal elderly without amyloid-β accumulation (normal ageing; n = 13, age at death: 82.9 ± 10.8 years) and neurologically normal elderly with extensive cortical amyloid-β deposits (pathological ageing; n = 15; age at death: 92.7 ± 5.9 years). The levels of amyloid-β40, amyloid-β42, APP, apolipoprotein E, the synaptic marker PSD95 (now known as DLG4), the astrocyte marker GFAP, other molecules related to amyloid-β metabolism, and tau were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We observed that familial Alzheimer's disease had disproportionate amyloid-β42 accumulation in subcortical areas compared with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, whereas sporadic Alzheimer's disease had disproportionate amyloid- β42 accumulation in cortical areas compared to familial Alzheimer's disease. Compared with normal ageing, the levels of several proteins involved in amyloid-β metabolism were significantly altered in both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease; however, such changes were not present in pathological ageing. Among molecules related to amyloid-β metabolism, the regional distribution of PSD95 strongly correlated with the regional pattern of amyloid-β42 accumulation in sporadic Alzheimer's disease and pathological ageing, whereas the regional distribution of APP as well as β-C-terminal fragment of APP were strongly associated with the regional pattern of amyloid-β42 accumulation in familial Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E and GFAP showed negative regional association with amyloid-β (especially amyloid-β40) accumulation in both sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease. Familial Alzheimer's disease had greater striatal tau pathology than sporadic Alzheimer's disease. In a retrospective medical record review, atypical signs and symptoms were more frequent in familial Alzheimer's disease compared with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that disproportionate amyloid-β42 accumulation in cortical areas in sporadic Alzheimer's disease may be mediated by synaptic processes, whereas disproportionate amyloid-β42 accumulation in subcortical areas in familial Alzheimer's disease may be driven by APP and its processing. Region-specific amyloid-β42 accumulation might account for differences in the relative amounts of tau pathology and clinical symptoms in familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. © 2014 The Author (2014).

Methods: Patients with autopsy-confirmed low-, intermediate-, and high-likelihood DLB, according to the probability statement recommended by the third report of the DLB Consortium, and antemortem MRI, were identified (n = 75). The clinical history was assessed for presence (n = 35) and absence (n = 40) of probable REM sleep behavior disorder (pRBD), and patients' antemortem MRIs were compared using voxel-based morphometry. Pathologic burdens of phospho-tau, b-amyloid, and a-synuclein were measured in regions associated with early neuropathologic involvement, the hippocampus and amygdala. Results: pRBD was present in 21 patients (60%) with high-likelihood, 12 patients (34%) with intermediate-likelihood, and 2 patients (6%) with low-likelihood DLB. Patients with pRBD were younger, more likely to be male (p ≤ 0.001), and had a more frequent neuropathologic diagnosis of diffuse (neocortical) Lewy body disease. In the hippocampus and amygdala, phospho-tau and b-amyloid burden were lower in patients with pRBD compared with those without pRBD (p < 0.01). α-Synuclein burden did not differ in the hippocampus, but trended in the amygdala. Patients without pRBD had greater atrophy of temporoparietal cortices, hippocampus, and amygdala (p < 0.001) than those with pRBD; atrophy of the hippocampus (p = 0.005) and amygdala (p = 0.02) were associated with greater phospho-tau burdens in these regions. Conclusion: Presence of pRBD is associated with a higher likelihood of DLB and less severe Alzheimer-related pathology in the medial temporal lobes, whereas absence of pRBD is characterized by Alzheimer-like atrophy patterns on MRI and increased phospho-tau burden. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.",,43,0,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2013-11-01

We assessed regional NFT density in 30 patients with AD, 10 of which presented as the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) and 20 that presented as dementia of the Alzheimer's type (DAT). Regional grey matter volumes were measured using antemortem MRI. NFT density was significantly higher in left temporoparietal cortices in lvPPA compared to DAT, with no differences observed in hippocampus. There was a trend for the ratio of temporoparietal-to-hippocampal NFT density to be higher in lvPPA. The imaging findings mirrored the pathological findings, with smaller left temporoparietal volumes observed in lvPPA compared to DAT, and no differences observed in hippocampal volume. This study demonstrates that lvPPA is associated with a phenomenon of enhanced temporoparietal neurodegeneration, a finding that improves our understanding of the biological basis of lvPPA. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Alzheimer's dementia | Alzheimer's disease | Apolipoprotein E | Hippocampus | Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia | MRI | Neurofibrillary tangles | Primary progressive aphasia | TDP-43 | Voxel-based morphometry,41,0,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2013-11-01

Methods: A 2-step protocol, with a fluorescent PCR and a repeat-primed PCR, was used to determine the presence of hexanucleotide expansions in C9ORF72. For one double mutant, we performed Southern blots to assess expansion sizes, and immunohistochemistry to characterize neuropathology. Results: We detected C9ORF72 repeat expansions in 4 of 334 subjects (1.2% [or 1.8% of 217 families]). All these subjects had behavioral phenotypes and also harbored well-known pathogenic mutations in either progranulin (GRN: p.C466LfsX46, p.R493X, p.C31LfsX35) or microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT: p.P301L). Southern blotting of one double mutant with a p.C466LfsX46 GRN mutation demonstrated a long repeat expansion in brain (>3,000 repeats), and immunohistochemistry showed mixed neuropathology with characteristics of both C9ORF72 expansions and GRN mutations. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that co-occurrence of 2 evidently pathogenic mutations could contribute to the pleiotropy that is detected in patients with C9ORF72 repeat expansions. These findings suggest that patients with known mutations should not be excluded from further studies, and that genetic counselors should be aware of this phenomenon when advising patients and their family members. © 2013 American Academy of Neurology.",,68,0,NIH,P01AG003949,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2013-10-01

Hippocampal sclerosis (HpScl) is a common finding in FTLD-TDP. Our objective was to screen for the presence of C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat expansions in a pathologically confirmed cohort of pure hippocampal sclerosis cases (n = 33), outside the setting of FTLD-TDP and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a recently described repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) translation (C9RANT) antibody that was found to be highly specific for c9FTD/ALS, we identified a single pure HpScl autopsy case with a repeat expansion in C9ORF72 (c9HpScl). Mutation screening was also performed with repeat-primed polymerase chain reaction and further confirmed with Southern blotting. The c9HpScl patient had a 14-year history of a slowly progressive amnestic syndrome and a clinical diagnosis of probable AD. Neuropsychological testing revealed memory impairment, but no deficits in other cognitive domains. Autopsy showed hippocampal sclerosis with TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal inclusions relatively limited to limbic lobe structures. Neuritic pathology immunoreactive for p62 was more frequent than TDP-43 in amygdala and hippocampus. Frequent p62-positive neuronal inclusions were present in cerebellar granule neurons as is typical of C9ORF72 mutation carriers. There was no significant FTLD or motor neuron disease. C9RANT was found to be sensitive and specific in this autopsy-confirmed series of HpScl cases. The findings in this patient suggest that the clinical and pathologic spectrum of C9ORF72 repeat expansion is wider than frontotemporal dementia and motor neuron disease, including cases of progressive amnestic dementia with restricted TDP-43 pathology associated with HpScl. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",C9ORF72 | C9RANT | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | Hippocampus | Memory | Neuropathology,19,0,NIH,P01-Ag03949,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2013-10-01

We assessed whether expansion size is associated with disease severity or phenotype. Methods: We did a cross-sectional Southern blot characterisation study (Xpansize-72) in a cohort of individuals with FTD, MND, both these diseases, or no clinical phenotype. All participants had GGGGCC repeat expansions in C9ORF72, and high quality DNA was available from one or more of the frontal cortex, cerebellum, or blood. We used Southern blotting techniques and densitometry to estimate the repeat size of the most abundant expansion species. We compared repeat sizes between different tissues using Wilcoxon rank sum and Wilcoxon signed rank tests, and between disease subgroups using Kruskal-Wallis rank sum tests. We assessed the association of repeat size with age at onset and age at collection using a Spearman's test of correlation, and assessed the association between repeat size and survival after disease onset using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Findings: We included 84 individuals with C9ORF72 expansions: 35 had FTD, 16 had FTD and MND, 30 had MND, and three had no clinical phenotype. We focused our analysis on three major tissue subgroups: frontal cortex (available from 41 patients [21 with FTD, 11 with FTD and MND, and nine with MND]), cerebellum (40 patients [20 with FTD, 12 with FTD and MND, and eight with MND]), and blood (47 patients [15 with FTD, nine with FTD and MND, and 23 with MND] and three carriers who had no clinical phenotype). Repeat lengths in the cerebellum were smaller (median 12·3 kb [about 1667 repeat units], IQR 11·1-14·3) than those in the frontal cortex (33·8 kb [about 5250 repeat units], 23·5-44·9; p<0·0001) and those in blood (18·6 kb [about 2717 repeat units], 13·9-28·1; p=0·0002). Within these tissues, we detected no difference in repeat length between disease subgroups (cerebellum p=0·96, frontal cortex p=0·27, blood p=0·10). In the frontal cortex of patients with FTD, repeat length correlated with age at onset (r=0·63; p=0·003) and age at sample collection (r=0·58; p=0·006); we did not detect such a correlation in samples from the cerebellum or blood. When assessing cerebellum samples from the overall cohort, survival after disease onset was 4·8 years (IQR 3·0-7·4) in the group with expansions greater than 1467 repeat units (the 25th percentile of repeat lengths) versus 7·4 years (6·3-10·9) in the group with smaller expansions (HR 3·27, 95% CI 1·34-7·95; p=0·009). Interpretation: We detected substantial variation in repeat sizes between samples from the cerebellum, frontal cortex, and blood, and longer repeat sizes in the cerebellum seem to be associated with a survival disadvantage. Our findings indicate that expansion size does affect disease severity, which-if replicated in other cohorts-could be relevant for genetic counselling.

Methods: The clinical and neuropathologic findings were analyzed on all autopsied cases from one of the collaborating sites in North America and Europe, were evaluated from January 1990 to March 2012, and were diagnosed with polysomnogram (PSG)-proven or probable RBD with or without a coexisting neurologic disorder. The clinical and neuropathologic diagnoses were based on published criteria. Results: 172 cases were identified, of whom 143 (83%) were men. The mean ± SD age of onset in years for the core features were as follows - RBD, 62 ± 14 (range, 20-93), cognitive impairment (n = 147); 69 ± 10 (range, 22-90), parkinsonism (n = 151); 68 ± 9 (range, 20-92), and autonomic dysfunction (n = 42); 62 ± 12 (range, 23-81). Death age was 75 ± 9 years (range, 24-96). Eighty-two (48%) had RBD confirmed by PSG, 64 (37%) had a classic history of recurrent dream enactment behavior, and 26 (15%) screened positive for RBD by questionnaire. RBD preceded the onset of cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, or autonomic dysfunction in 87 (51%) patients by 10 ± 12 (range, 1-61) years. The primary clinical diagnoses among those with a coexisting neurologic disorder were dementia with Lewy bodies (n = 97), Parkinson's disease with or without mild cognitive impairment or dementia (n = 32), multiple system atrophy (MSA) (n = 19), Alzheimer's disease (AD)(n = 9) and other various disorders including secondary narcolepsy (n = 2) and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation-type 1 (NBAI-1) (n = 1). The neuropathologic diagnoses were Lewy body disease (LBD)(n = 77, including 1 case with a duplication in the gene encoding α-synuclein), combined LBD and AD (n = 59), MSA (n = 19), AD (n = 6), progressive supranulear palsy (PSP) (n = 2), other mixed neurodegenerative pathologies (n = 6), NBIA-1/LBD/tauopathy (n = 1), and hypothalamic structural lesions (n = 2). Among the neurodegenerative disorders associated with RBD (n = 170), 160 (94%) were synucleinopathies. The RBD-synucleinopathy association was particularly high when RBD preceded the onset of other neurodegenerative syndrome features. Conclusions: In this large series of PSG-confirmed and probable RBD cases that underwent autopsy, the strong association of RBD with the synucleinopathies was further substantiated and a wider spectrum of disorders which can underlie RBD now are more apparent. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Dementia with Lewy bodies | Lewy body disease | Multiple system atrophy | Parasomnia | Parkinson's disease | REM sleep behavior disorder | Synuclein | Synucleinopathy,228,0,NIA,P50 NS072187-01S2,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,1,2013-08-01

We identified three cases of CBD with olivopontocerebellar atrophy (CBD-OPCA) that did not have a-synuclein-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Two patients had clinical features suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and the third case had cerebellar ataxia thought to be due to idiopathic OPCA. Neuropathologic features of CBD-OPCA are compared to typical CBD, as well as MSA and PSP. CBD-OPCA and MSA had marked neuronal loss in pontine nuclei, inferior olivary nucleus, and Purkinje cell layer. Neuronal loss and grumose degeneration in the cerebellar dentate nucleus were comparable in CBD-OPCA and PSP. Image analysis of tau pathology showed greater infratentorial tau burden, especially in pontine base, in CBD-OPCA compared with typical CBD. In addition, CBD-OPCA had TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal and glial cytoplasmic inclusions and threads throughout the basal ganglia and in olivopontocerebellar system. CBDOPCA met neuropathologic research diagnostic criteria for CBD and shared tau biochemical characteristics with typical CBD. These results suggest that CBD-OPCA is a distinct clinicopathologic variant of CBD with olivopontocerebellar TDP-43 pathology. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",Corticobasal degeneration | Multiple system atrophy | Olivopontocerebellar atrophy | Progressive supranuclear palsy | Tauopathy | TDP-43,29,0,NIH,P50AG016574,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2013-05-01

In addition to TDP-43-positive neuronal and glial inclusions, C9ORF72-linked FTLD-TDP has characteristic TDP-43-negative neuronal cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions as well as dystrophic neurites in the hippocampus and cerebellum. These lesions are immunopositive for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding proteins, such as sequestosome-1/p62 and ubiquilin-2. Studies examining the frequency of the C9ORF72 mutation in clinically probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) have found a small proportion of AD cases with the mutation. This prompted us to systematically explore the frequency of Alzheimer-type pathology in a series of 17 FTLD-TDP cases with mutations in C9ORF72 (FTLD-C9ORF72). We identified four cases with sufficient Alzheimer-type pathology to meet criteria for intermediate-to-high-likelihood AD. We compared AD pathology in the 17 FTLD-C9ORF72 to 13 cases of FTLD-TDP linked to mutations in the gene for progranulin (FTLD-GRN) and 36 cases of sporadic FTLD (sFTLD). FTLD-C9ORF72 cases had higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage than FTLD-GRN. Increased tau pathology in FTLD-C9ORF72 was assessed with thioflavin-S fluorescent microscopy-based neurofibrillary tangle counts and with image analysis of tau burden in temporal cortex and hippocampus. FTLD-C9ORF72 had significantly more neurofibrillary tangles and higher tau burden compared with FTLD-GRN. The differences were most marked in limbic regions. On the other hand, sFTLD and FTLD-C9ORF72 had a similar burden of tau pathology. These results suggest FTLD-C9ORF72 has increased propensity for tau pathology compared to FTLD-GRN, but not sFTLD. The accumulation of tau as well as lesions immunoreactive for ubiquitin and ubiquitin-binding proteins (p62 and ubiquilin-2) suggests that mutations in C9ORF72 may involve disrupted protein degradation that favors accumulation of multiple different proteins. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",C9ORF72 | Frontotemporal lobar degeneration | P62 | Tau | Ubiquilin-2 | Ubiquitin,68,0,NIH,P01AG003949,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,0,2013-02-01

Of these four subtypes, motor neuron disease is more commonly associated with type B pathology, but has also been reported with type A pathology. We have noted, however, the unusual occurrence of cases of type C pathology having corticospinal tract degeneration. We aimed to assess the severity of corticospinal tract degeneration in a large cohort of cases with type C (n = 31). Pathological analysis included semi-quantitation of myelin loss of fibres of the corticospinal tract and associated macrophage burden, as well as axonal loss, at the level of the medullary pyramids. We also assessed for motor cortex degeneration and fibre loss of the medial lemniscus/olivocerebellar tract. All cases were subdivided into three groups based on the degree of corticospinal tract degeneration: (i) no corticospinal tract degeneration; (ii) equivocal corticospinal tract degeneration; and (iii) moderate to very severe corticospinal tract degeneration. Clinical, genetic, pathological and imaging comparisons were performed across groups. Eight cases had no corticospinal tract degeneration, and 14 cases had equivocal to mild corticospinal tract degeneration. Nine cases, however, had moderate to very severe corticospinal tract degeneration with myelin and axonal loss. In these nine cases, there was degeneration of the motor cortex without lower motor neuron degeneration or involvement of other brainstem tracts. These cases most commonly presented as semantic dementia, and they had longer disease duration (mean: 15.3 years) compared with the other two groups (10.8 and 9.9 years; P = 0.03). After adjusting for disease duration, severity of corticospinal tract degeneration remained significantly different across groups. Only one case, without corticospinal tract degeneration, was found to have a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene. All three groups were associated with anterior temporal lobe atrophy on MRI; however, the cases with moderate to severe corticospinal tract degeneration showed right-sided temporal lobe asymmetry and greater involvement of the right temporal lobe and superior motor cortices than the other groups. In contrast, the cases with no or equivocal corticospinal tract degeneration were more likely to show left-sided temporal lobe asymmetry. For comparison, the corticospinal tract was assessed in 86 type A and B cases, and only two cases showed evidence of corticospinal tract degeneration without lower motor neuron degeneration. These findings confirm that there exists a unique association between frontotemporal lobar degeneration with type C pathology and corticospinal tract degeneration, with this entity showing a predilection to involve the right temporal lobe. © 2013 The Author.",corticospinal tract | MRI | right temporal lobe | semantic dementia | TDP-43 type C,29,1,NIH,P01 AG03949,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,6,2013-01-01

Materials and Methods: This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board at the Mayo Clinic and informed consent was obtained. Postmortem tissue from age-matched PSP (n = 6) and control (n = 3) brains was imaged by using three-dimensional fast low-angle shot MR imaging with isotropic resolution of 50 μm. Relaxation times and parametric relaxation maps were generated from spin-echo and gradient-recalled-echo sequences. MR findings were correlated with histologic features by evaluating the presence of iron by using Prussian blue and ferritin and microglia burden as determined by a custom-designed color deconvolution algorithm. T2 and T2*, signal intensities, percent pixels (that could not be fitted in a pixel-by-pixel regression analysis due to severe hypointensity), and histologic data (total iron, ferritin, and microglia burden) were statistically analyzed by using independent sample t tests (P < .05). Results: PSP specimens showed higher iron burden in the cerebral peduncles and substantia nigra than did controls. However, only the putamen was significantly different, and it correlated with a decrease of T2*compared with controls (-48%; P = .043). Similarly, substantia nigra showed a significant decrease of T2*signal in PSP compared with controls (-57%; P = .028). Compared with controls, cerebral peduncles showed increased T2 (38%; P = .026) and T2*(34%; P = .014), as well as higher T2 signal intensity (57%; P = .049). Ferritin immunoreactivity was the opposite from iron burden and was significantly lower compared with controls in the putamen (-74%; P = .025), red nucleus (261%; P = .018), and entire basal ganglia section (263%; P = .016). Conclusion: High-field-strength MR microscopy yielded pronounced differences in substantia nigra and globus pallidus of PSP compared with control brains. Histologic data also suggested that the predominant iron in PSP is hemosiderin, not ferritin. Iron in the brain is a contrast enhancer and potential biomarker for PSP. © RSNA, 2012.",,14,1,NIA,P01AG003949,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,7,2013-01-01

A full understanding of the pathology underlying this clinicoradiologic finding is currently lacking in autopsy-confirmed normal brains. To determine the histopathologic basis of WMH seen on magnetic resonance imaging, we studied the relationship between postmortem fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) intensity and neuropathologic markers of WM lesions (WMLs) that correspond to WMH in cognitively normal aging brains. Samples of periventricular (n = 24), subcortical (n = 26), and normal-appearing WM (NAWM, n = 31) from 4clinically and pathologically confirmed normal cases were examined. The FLAIR intensity, vacuolation, and myelin basic protein immunoreactivity loss were significantly higher in periventricular WML versus subcortical WML; both were higher than in NAWM. The subcortical WML and NAWM had significantly less axonal loss, astrocytic burden, microglial density, and oligodendrocyte loss than those of the periventricular WML. Thus, vacuolation, myelin density, and small vessel density contribute to the rarefaction of WM, whereas axonal density, oligodendrocyte density, astroglial burden, and microglial density did not. These data suggest that the age-related loss of myelin basic protein and the decrease in small vessel density may contribute to vacuolation of WM. Vacuolation enables interstitial fluid to accumulate, which contributes to the prolonged T2 relaxation and elevated FLAIR intensity in the WM. © 2012 by the American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.",Digital microscopy | Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery | Normal aging | Oligodendrocytes | Postmortem magnetic resonance imaging | White matter,61,1,NIA,P50AG016574,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,0,2012-12-01

AD subtypes not only have pathologic, but also demographic, clinical, and genetic differences. Neurofibrillary tanglepredominant dementia (NFTD), a disorder with NFTs relatively restricted to limbic structures, shares this feature with LP AD raising the possibility that NFTD is a variant of AD. The objective criteria for pathologic diagnosis of NFTD are not available. A goal of this study was to design a mathematical algorithm that could diagnose NFTD from NFT and senile plaque (SP) counts in hippocampus and association cortices, analogous to that used to subtype AD. Moreover, we aimed to compare pathologic, demographic, clinical, and genetic features of NFTD (n = 18) with LP AD (n = 19), as well as the other AD subtypes, typical AD (n = 52) and HpSp AD (n = 17). Using digital microscopy, we confirmed that burden of phospho-tau (CP13) and of an NFT conformational epitope (Ab39) correlated with NFT densities and showed expected patterns across AD subtypes. HpSp AD had the highest and LP AD had the lowest burden of cortical CP13 and Ab39 immunoreactivity. On the other hand, cortical b-amyloid burden did not significantly differ between AD subtypes. Semi-quantitative assessment of SPs in the basal ganglia did show HpSp AD to have significantly more frequent presence of SPs compared to typical AD, which was more frequent than LP AD. Compared to LP AD, NFTD had an older age at disease onset and shorter disease duration, as well as lower Braak NFT stage. NFTs and SPs on thioflavin-S fluorescent microscopy, as well as CP13, Ab39, and Ab immunoreactivities were very low in the frontal cortex of NFTD, differentiating NFTD from AD subtypes, including LP AD. MAPT H1H1 genotype frequency was high (*70 %) in NFTD and LP AD, and similar to typical AD, while APOE e4 carrier state was low in NFTD. While it shares clinical similarities with regard to female sex predominance, onset in advanced age, and a slow cognitive decline, NFTD has significant pathologic differences from LP AD, suggesting that it may not merely be a variant of AD. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Alzheimer disease | Amyloid plaques | APOE | Basal ganglia | Digital microscopy | MAPT | Neurofibrillary tangle-predominant dementia | Neurofibrillary tangles,71,0,NIA,P01 AG03949,National Institute on Aging,papers by authors,4,2012-11-01

Compared with typical AD, hippocampal-sparing AD has more neurofibrillary tangles in the cortex and fewer in the hippocampus, whereas the opposite pattern is seen in limbic-predominant AD. We aimed to determine whether MRI patterns of atrophy differ between these subtypes and whether structural neuroimaging could be a useful predictor of pathological subtype at autopsy. Methods: We identified patients who had been followed up in the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Rochester, MN, USA) or in the Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry (Rochester, MN, USA) between 1992 and 2005. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to have had dementia, AD pathology at autopsy (Braak stage ≥IV and intermediate to high probability of AD), and an ante-mortem MRI. Cases were assigned to one of three pathological subtypes-hippocampal-sparing, limbic-predominant, and typical AD-on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle counts in hippocampus and cortex and ratio of hippocampal to cortical burden, without reference to neuronal loss. Voxel-based morphometry and atlas-based parcellation were used to compare patterns of grey matter loss between groups and with age-matched control individuals. Neuroimaging was obtained at the time of first presentation. To summarise pair-wise group differences, we report the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Findings: Of 177 eligible patients, 125 (71%) were classified as having typical AD, 33 (19%) as having limbic-predominant AD, and 19 (11%) as having hippocampal-sparing AD. Most patients with typical (98 [78%]) and limbic-predominant AD (31 [94%]) initially presented with an amnestic syndrome, but fewer patients with hippocampal-sparing AD (eight [42%]) did. The most severe medial temporal atrophy was recorded in patients with limbic-predominant AD, followed by those with typical disease, and then those with hippocampal-sparing AD. Conversely, the most severe cortical atrophy was noted in patients with hippocampal-sparing AD, followed by those with typical disease, and then limbic-predominant AD. The ratio of hippocampal to cortical volumes allowed the best discrimination between subtypes (p<0·0001; three-way AUROC 0·52 [95% CI 0·47-0·52]; ratio of AUROC to chance classification 3·1 [2·8-3·1]). Patients with typical AD and non-amnesic initial presentation had a significantly higher ratio of hippocampal to cortical volumes (median 0·045 [IQR 0·035-0·056]) than did those with an amnesic presentation (0·041 [0·031-0·057]; p=0·001). Interpretation: Patterns of atrophy on MRI differ across the pathological subtypes of AD. MRI regional volumetric analysis can reliably track the distribution of neurofibrillary tangle pathology and can predict pathological subtype of AD at autopsy.

Methods: We retrospectively identified 56 subjects who underwent antemortem MRI and had Lewy body (LB) pathology at autopsy. Subjects were pathologically classified as high (n = 25), intermediate (n = 22), and low likelihood DLB (n = 9) according to the Third Report of the DLB Consortium criteria. We included 2 additional pathologic comparison groups without LBs: one with low likelihood Alzheimer disease (AD) (control; n = 27) and one with high likelihood AD (n = 33). The associations between MRI-based volumetric measurements and the pathologic classification of DLB were tested with analysis of covariance by adjusting for age, sex, and MRI-to-death interval. Results: Antemortem hippocampal and amygdalar volumes increased from low to intermediate to high likelihood DLB (p < 0.001, trend test). Smaller hippocampal and amygdalar volumes were associated with higher Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage (p < 0.001). Antemortem dorsal mesopontine gray matter (GM) atrophy was found in those with high likelihood DLB compared with normal control subjects (p = 0.004) and those with AD (p = 0.01). Dorsal mesopontine GM volume decreased from low to intermediate to high likelihood DLB (p = 0.01, trend test). Conclusion: Antemortem hippocampal and amygdalar volumes increase and dorsal mesopontine GM volumes decrease in patients with low to high likelihood DLB according to the Third Report of the DLB Consortium criteria. Patients with high likelihood DLB typically have normal hippocampal volumes but have atrophy in the dorsal mesopontine GM nuclei.

RBD is often associated with α-synuclein pathology, and we examined if there is a relationship of RBD with cholinergic neuronal loss in the pedunculopontine/laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (PPN/LDT), compared to catecholaminergic neurones in a neighbouring nucleus, the locus coeruleus (LC). Methods: This retrospective study utilized human brain banked tissues of 11 Lewy body disease (LBD) cases with RBD, 10 LBD without RBD, 19 Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 10 neurologically normal controls. Tissues were stained with choline acetyl transferase immunohistochemistry to label neurones of PPN/LDT and tyrosine hydroxylase for the LC. The burden of tau and α-synuclein pathology was measured in the same regions with immunohistochemistry. Results: Both the LC and PPN/LDT were vulnerable to α-synuclein pathology in LBD and tau pathology in AD, but significant neuronal loss was only detected in these nuclei in LBD. Greater cholinergic depletion was found in both LBD groups, regardless of RBD status, when compared with normals and AD. There were no differences in either degree of neuronal loss or burden of α-synuclein pathology in LBD with and without RBD. Conclusions: Whether decreases in brainstem cholinergic neurones in LBD contribute to RBD is uncertain, but our findings indicate these neurones are highly vulnerable to α-synuclein pathology in LBD and tau pathology in AD. The mechanism of selective α-synuclein-mediated neuronal loss in these nuclei remains to be determined. © 2011 The Authors.

We describe the key characteristics in the probands and their affected relatives who have been evaluated at Mayo Clinic Rochester or Mayo Clinic Florida in whom the hexanucleotide repeat expansion were found. Forty-three probands and 10 of their affected relatives with DNA available (total 53 subjects) were shown to carry the hexanucleotide repeat expansion. Thirty-six (84%) of the 43 probands had a familial disorder, whereas seven (16%) appeared to be sporadic. Among examined subjects from the 43 families (n=63), the age of onset ranged from 33 to 72 years (median 52 years) and survival ranged from 1 to 17 years, with the age of onset <40 years in six (10%) and >60 in 19 (30%). Clinical diagnoses among examined subjects included behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia with or without parkinsonism (n=30), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n=18), frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with or without parkinsonism (n=12), and other various syndromes (n=3). Parkinsonism was present in 35% of examined subjects, all of whom had behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia or frontotemporal dementia/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as the dominant clinical phenotype. No subject with a diagnosis of primary progressive aphasia was identified with this mutation. Incomplete penetrance was suggested in two kindreds, and the youngest generation had significantly earlier age of onset (>10 years) compared with the next oldest generation in 11 kindreds. Neuropsychological testing showed a profile of slowed processing speed, complex attention/executive dysfunction, and impairment in rapid word retrieval. Neuroimaging studies showed bilateral frontal abnormalities most consistently, with more variable degrees of parietal with or without temporal changes; no case had strikingly focal or asymmetric findings. Neuropathological examination of 14 patients revealed a range of transactive response DNA binding protein molecular weight 43 pathology (10 type A and four type B), as well as ubiquitin-positive cerebellar granular neuron inclusions in all but one case. Motor neuron degeneration was detected in nine patients, including five patients without ante-mortem signs of motor neuron disease. While variability exists, most cases with this mutation have a characteristic spectrum of demographic, clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging and especially neuropathological findings. © The Author (2012).",amyotrophic lateral sclerosis | chromosome 9 | frontotemporal dementia | motor neuron disease | neurogenetics | TDP-43,262,0,NIH,P50 NS072187,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2012-01-01

Patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) with probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior sleep disorder (n = 71) were compared with those without it (n = 19) on demographics, clinical variables (core features of dementia with Lewy bodies, dementia duration, rate of cognitive/motor changes), and pathologic indices (Lewy body distribution, neuritic plaque score, Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage). Individuals with probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder were predominantly male (82% vs 47%) and had a shorter duration of dementia (mean, 8 vs 10 years), earlier onset of parkinsonism (mean, 2 vs 5 years), and earlier onset of visual hallucinations (mean, 3 vs 6 years). These patients also had a lower Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage (stage IV vs stage VI) and lower neuritic plaque scores (18% vs 85% frequency), but no difference in Lewy body distribution. When probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder developed early (at or before dementia onset), the onset of parkinsonism and hallucinations was earlier and Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage was lower compared with those who developed the sleep disorder after dementia onset. Women with autopsy-confirmed DLB without a history of dream enactment behavior during sleep had a later onset of hallucinations and parkinsonism and a higher Braak NFT stage.

Strong evidence supporting this is the existence of kindreds with family members affected by FTD, ALS or mixed features of FTD and ALS, referred to as FTD-MND. Some of these families have linkage to chromosome 9, with hexanucleotide expansion mutation in a noncoding region of C9ORF72. Discovery of the mutation defines c9FTD/ALS. Prior to discovery of mutations in C9ORF72, it was assumed that TDP-43 pathology in c9FTD/ALS was uniform. In this study, we examined the neuropathology and clinical features of 20 cases of c9FTD/ALS from a brain bank for neurodegenerative disorders. Included are six patients clinically diagnosed with ALS, eight FTD, one FTD-MND and four Alzheimer-type dementia. Clinical information was unavailable for one patient. Pathologically, the cases all had TDP-43 pathology, but there were three major pathologic groups: ALS, FTLD-MND and FTLD-TDP. The ALS cases were morphologically similar to typical sporadic ALS with almost no extramotor TDP-43 pathology; all had oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions. The FTLD-MND showed predominantly Mackenzie Type 3 TDP-43 pathology, and all had ALS-like pathology in motor neurons, but more extensive extramotor pathology, with oligodendroglial cytoplasmic inclusions and infrequent hippocampal sclerosis. The FTLD-TDP cases had several features similar to FTLD-TDP due to mutations in the gene for progranulin, including Mackenzie Type 1 TDP-43 pathology with neuronal intranuclear inclusions and hippocampal sclerosis. FTLD-TDP patients were older and some were thought to have Alzheimer-type dementia. In addition to the FTD and ALS clinical presentations, the present study shows that c9FTD/ALS can have other presentations, possibly related to age of onset and the presence of hippocampal sclerosis. Moreover, there is pathologic heterogeneity not only between ALS and FTLD, but also within the FTLD group. Further studies are needed to address the molecular mechanism of clinical and pathological heterogeneity of c9FTD/ALS due to mutations in C9ORF72. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,232,0,NIH,P01AG003949,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,5,2011-12-01

Although both disorders are characterized by abnormal accumulation of 4-repeat tau, they display distinct proteolytic profiles of tau species and they have distinct astrocytic lesions, astrocytic plaques in CBD and tufted astrocytes in PSP. To investigate other differences between these two disorders at the molecular level, we compared the profiles of proteins from caudate nucleus of CBD and PSP by quantitative two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. Twenty-one protein spots differentially expressed in CBD and PSP were dissected for mass spectrometry (MS). One of the spots was identified by MS to contain light chain (LC) ferritin. Western blot analysis verified the presence of LC ferritin in this spot and showed that this protein was two-fold higher in caudate of CBD than that of PSP samples. These results were confirmed by LC ferritin immunohistochemistry. Co-labeling of caudate nucleus with tau and LC ferritin antibodies showed the presence of LC ferritin immunoreactivity in astrocytic plaques of CBD, but minimal labeling of tufted astrocytes in PSP. This difference did not reflect the extent of gliosis. Analysis of other brain regions in CBD and PSP showed no difference in LC ferritin levels. Together the data suggest that LC ferritin is a unique marker of astrocytic lesions in CBD, adding further support to the notion that CBD and PSP are distinct clinicopathologic entities. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",CBD | DIGE | Ferritin | Proteomics | PSP,4,0,NINDS,P50NS072187,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke,papers by authors,6,2011-12-01

Familial FTLD-tau is usually due to mutations in the tau gene (MAPT). Even FTLD-tau determined by MAPT mutations has clinical and pathologic heterogeneity. Tauopathies are subclassified according to the predominant species of tau that accumulates, with respect to alternative splicing of MAPT, with tau proteins containing three (3R) or four repeats (4R) of ~32 amino acids in the microtubule binding domain. In Pick's disease (PiD), 3R tau predominates, whereas 4R tau is characteristic of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Depending upon the specific mutation in MAPT, familial FTLD-tau can have 3R, 4R or a combination of 3R and 4R tau. PiD is the least common FTLD-tau characterized by neuronal Pick bodies in a stereotypic neuroanatomical distribution. PSP and CBD are more common than PiD and have extensive clinical and pathologic overlap, with no distinctive clinical syndrome or biomarker that permits their differentiation. Diagnosis rests upon postmortem examination of the brain and demonstration of globose tangles, oligodendroglial coiled bodies and tufted astrocytes in PSP or threads, pretangles and astrocytic plaques in CBD.

We aimed to compare clinical and neuropathological features between typical and atypical AD cases. Methods: AD cases with a Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage of more than IV were identified from a brain bank database. By use of thioflavin-S fluorescence microscopy, we assessed the density and the distribution of neurofibrillary tangles in three cortical regions and two hippocampal sectors. These data were used to construct an algorithm to classify AD cases into typical, hippocampal sparing, or limbic predominant. Classified cases were then compared for clinical, demographic, pathological, and genetic characteristics. An independent cohort of AD cases was assessed to validate findings from the initial cohort. Findings: 889 cases of AD, 398 men and 491 women with age at death of 37-103 years, were classified with the algorithm as hippocampal sparing (97 cases [11%]), typical (665 [75%]), or limbic predominant (127 [14%]). By comparison with typical AD, neurofibrillary tangle counts per 0.125 mm2 in hippocampal sparing cases were higher in cortical areas (median 13, IQR 11-16) and lower in the hippocampus (7.5, 5.2-9.5), whereas counts in limbic-predominant cases were lower in cortical areas (4.3, 3.0-5.7) and higher in the hippocampus (27, 22-35). Hippocampal sparing cases had less hippocampal atrophy than did typical and limbic-predominant cases. Patients with hippocampal sparing AD were younger at death (mean 72 years [SD 10]) and a higher proportion of them were men (61 [63%]), whereas those with limbic-predominant AD were older (mean 86 years [SD 6]) and a higher proportion of them were women (87 [69%]). Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) H1H1 genotype was more common in limbic-predominant AD (54 [70%]) than in hippocampal sparing AD (24 [46%]; p=0.011), but did not differ significantly between limbic-predominant and typical AD (204 [59%]; p=0.11). Apolipoprotein E (APOE) e{open}4 allele status differed between AD subtypes only when data were stratified by age at onset. Clinical presentation, age at onset, disease duration, and rate of cognitive decline differed between the AD subtypes. These findings were confirmed in a validation cohort of 113 patients with AD. Interpretation: These data support the hypothesis that AD has distinct clinicopathological subtypes. Hippocampal sparing and limbic-predominant AD subtypes might account for about 25% of cases, and hence should be considered when designing clinical, genetic, biomarker, and treatment studies in patients with AD.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate frequency, neuroanatomical selectivity and disease specificity of tau pathology in visual and auditory nuclei (SC and lateral geniculate body (LGB); IC and medial geniculate body (MGB), respectively). We measured phospho-tau burden with immunohistochemistry and image analysis in 26 cases of AD, 37 PSP and 11 normal controls. Tau burden was also assessed in two unrelated brainstem nuclei (substantia nigra (SN) and pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN)) of the same cases. We found tau burden to be greater in the SC of PSP compared to AD and controls. Conversely, tau burden was greater in the IC of AD compared to PSP and controls. The MGB and LGB had sparse tau pathology in both AD and PSP. This disease selectivity parallels known deficits in visual reflexes in PSP and auditory reflexes in AD. Tau burden was greater in the SC, IC, and PPN in both PSP and AD compared to controls, and greater in the SN in PSP compared to AD and controls. Although present at early Braak neurofibrillary tangle stages, the SC, IC, PPN and SN did not accumulate tau consistently until later stages. These findings support a concept of tau pathology affecting the brainstem at mid-to-late stage AD. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Alzheimer's disease | Colliculi | Geniculate bodies | Pedunculopontine nucleus | Progressive supranuclear palsy | Substantia nigra | Tau,41,0,NIH,P01AG017216,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,1,2011-03-01

Corticobasal syndrome is the clinical phenotype originally described for corticobasal degeneration, characterized by asymmetric rigidity and apraxia, cortical sensory deficits, dystonia and myoclonus. Some patients do not develop these features, but instead have clinical features consistent with the Richardson syndrome presentation of progressive supranuclear palsy, characterized by postural instability, early unexplained falls, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, symmetric motor disability and dysphagia. The aim of this study was to identify differences in corticobasal degeneration presenting with corticobasal syndrome (n=11) or Richardson syndrome (n=15) with respect to demographic, clinical and neuropathological features. Corticobasal degeneration cases were also compared with patients with pathologically proven progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome (n=15). Cases with corticobasal degeneration, regardless of presentation, shared histopathological and tau biochemical characteristics, but they had differing densities of tau pathology in neuroanatomical regions that correlated with their clinical presentation. In particular, those with corticobasal syndrome had greater tau pathology in the primary motor and somatosensory cortices and putamen, while those with Richardson syndrome had greater tau pathology in limbic and hindbrain structures. Compared with progressive supranuclear palsy, patients with corticobasal degeneration and Richardson syndrome had less neuronal loss in the subthalamic nucleus, but more severe neuronal loss in the medial substantia nigra and greater atrophy of the anterior corpus callosum. Clinically, they had more cognitive impairment and frontal behavioural dysfunction. The results suggest that Richardson syndrome can be a clinicopathological presentation of corticobasal degeneration. Atrophy of anterior corpus callosum may be a potential neuroimaging marker to differentiate corticobasal degeneration from progressive supranuclear palsy in patients with Richardson syndrome. © 2011 The Author.",corticobasal degeneration | immunocytochemistry | pathology | progressive supranuclear palsy | tau protein,79,1,NIH,R01-AG024040,National Institutes of Health,papers by authors,2,2011-01-01

We acquired T2 and T2*weighted images that demonstrated diffuse and patchy lower intensities in the basal ganglia compared to control. There are several paramagnetic substances in brain tissue that could potentially reduce both T2 and T2*relaxation times, including ferritin, iron (Fe3+), manganese, copper and others. Because iron is most abundant, low intensities on T2 and T2*weighted images most likely reflect iron deposition. Iron, especially Fe3+, deposition was visible in the pathological specimens stained with Prussian blue after images were obtained. Although radiological-pathological comparisons are not straightforward with respect to either the MRI signal or relaxation quantification, there appears to be a correlation between the relative increase in iron as assessed by Prussian blue staining and the decrease in T 2*value between the DLB and control specimens. As such, this exceptionally high field MRI technique may provide details about the role that iron deposition plays either directly or indirectly as a biomarker in neurodegenerative processes.",21.1T | Basal ganglia | High-field MRI | Lewy body disease | Prussian blue,3,1,,undefined,,papers by authors,3,2011-01-01

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Population-based study on the incidence and prevalence of cognitive impairment in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Participants: A total of 148 elderly subjects (65 men) without dementia ranging in age from 73 to 91 years. Main Outcome Measures: We measured the percentage of the total white matter volume classified as WMH in a priori-defined brain regions (ie, frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital, periventricular, or subcortical). Motor impairment was evaluated qualitatively using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale summary measures of motor skills and quantitatively using a digitized portable walkway system. Four cognitive domains were evaluated using z scores of memory, language, executive function, and visuospatial reasoning. Results: A higher WMH proportion in all regions except the occipital lobewasassociated with lower executive function z score (P value <.01). A higher WMH proportion in all regions, butmoststrongly for the parietal lobe, correlated with higher Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale gait, posture,andpostural stabilitysum(P value <.01).Ahigher WMH proportion, whether periventricular, subcortical, or lobar, correlated with reduced velocity (P value <.001). Conclusions: We conclude that executive function is the primary cognitive domain affected by WMH burden. The data suggest that WMH in the parietal lobe are chiefly responsible for reduced balance and postural support compared with the other 3 lobes and may alter integration of sensory information via parietal lobe dysfunction in the aging brain. Parietal white matter changes were not the pre-dominant correlate with motor speed, lending evidence to a global involvement of neural networks in gait velocity. ©2010 American Medical Association.

We aimed to determine whether patterns of gray matter atrophy from antemortem MRI correlate with Braak staging of NFT pathology. METHODS: Eighty-three subjects with Braak stage III through VI, a pathologic diagnosis of low- to high-probability AD, and MRI within 4 years of death were identified. Voxel-based morphometry assessed gray matter atrophy in each Braak stage compared with 20 pathologic control subjects (Braak stages 0 through II). RESULTS: In pairwise comparisons with Braak stages 0 through II, a graded response was observed across Braak stages V and VI, with more severe and widespread loss identified at Braak stage VI. No regions of loss were identified in Braak stage III or IV compared with Braak stages 0 through II. The lack of findings in Braak stages III and IV could be because Braak stage is based on the presence of any NFT pathology regardless of severity. Actual NFT burden may vary by Braak stage. Therefore, tau burden was assessed in subjects with Braak stages 0 through IV. Those with high tau burden showed greater gray matter loss in medial and lateral temporal lobes than those with low tau burden. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of gray matter loss are associated with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, specifically with NFT burden at Braak stages III and IV and with Braak stage itself at higher stages. This validates three-dimensional patterns of atrophy on MRI as an approximate in vivo surrogate indicator of the full brain topographic representation of the neurodegenerative aspect of Alzheimer disease pathology.

Tg2576 and their nontransgenic (NTg) littermates were assessed at 3 and 6 months of age when there is little to no amyloid plaque deposition. After reversal-learning assessment, Aβ40 and Aβ42 were quantified in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Tg2576 mice were impaired in reversal-learning at 6 but not 3 months of age when compared to the NTg group. Coincidently, there was a corresponding approximately 3-fold increase of Aβ42 levels in the prefrontal cortex of 6- compared to 3-month-old Tg2576 mice. In addition, the prefrontal cortex contained higher levels of Aβ42 compared to the hippocampus at both 3 and 6 months of age, regardless of genotype, indicating a high vulnerability of this brain region to Aβ42 accumulation. These data suggest that the early emergence of reversal-learning deficits in the Tg2576 mouse may be due to the localized increase of Aβ42 in the prefrontal cortex. ©2008 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",Amyloid precursor protein | Executive function | Learning errors | Perseverative errors,21,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,1,2008-08-01

This review brings attention to the current challenges in the clinical and pathologic diagnoses of vascular dementia, provides an overview of diagnostic schemes in the clinical setting, and discusses the post-mortem pathology associated with VaD. While memory impairment is essential for diagnosis of AD, the clinical syndrome in VaD is often characterized by executive dysfunction rather than memory impairment Nevertheless, the cognitive symptoms of VaD are so pleomorphic that no single cognitive syndrome captures the range of symptomology. Additionally, there are no widely accepted neuropathologic criteria for VaD. Imaging studies provide information about the distribution and volume of lesions and provide supportive information that differentiates VaD from AD, but are complicated by the concept of ""silent infarcts"". The heterogeneity of cerebrovascular disease and the wide range of pathologic lesions suggest that classification of VaD should include specific subtypes. The main challenge in clinicopathologic correlative studies is the lack of a gold standard for pathologic diagnosis of VaD that includes thresholds for number, size and location of infarcts and ischemic injury to white matter and strategic sites such as the thalamus and hippocampus. VaD is an entity that provides many challenges to the clinician, neuroradiologist and neuropathologist in part because evidence-based studies often lack clear definitions of the disease.","Cerebrovascular disorders | Dementia, vascular, diagnosis | Neuroradiography | Risk factors",19,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2007-12-01

Tg2576 mice and their non-transgenic littermates were assessed at both 6 and 14 months of age in a battery of cognitive tests: attentional set-shifting, water maze spatial reference memory and T-maze working memory. Spatial reference memory was not affected by Tg status at either age. Working memory was only affected by age, with 6-month-old mice performing better than 14-month-old ones. Older mice were also significantly impaired on reversal learning and on the intra- and extra-dimensional shift in attentional set-shifting. A significant transgene effect was apparent in reversal learning, with Tg2576 mice requiring more trials to reach criterion at 6 months old.

Immature stages of the gall midge, Asphondylia borrichiae, are attacked by four species of parasitoids, which vary in size and relative abundance within patches of the gall midge's primary host plant, sea oxeye daisy (Borrichia frutescens). 2. In the current study, a bagging experiment found that the smallest wasp, Galeopsomyia haemon, was most abundant in galls exposed to natural enemies early in the experiment, when gall diameter is smallest, while the wasp with the longest ovipositor, Torymus umbilicatus, dominated the parasitoid community in galls that were not exposed until the 5th and 6th weeks when gall diameter is maximal. 3. Moreover, the mean number of parasitoids captured using large artificial galls were 70% and 150% higher compared with medium and small galls respectively, while stem height of artificial galls significantly affected parasitoid distribution. Galls that were level with the top of the sea oxeye canopy captured 60% more parasitoids compared with those below the canopy and 50% more than galls higher than the plant canopy. 4. These non-random patterns were driven primarily by the differential distribution of the largest parasitoid, T. umbilicatus, which was found significantly more often than expected on large galls and the smallest parasitoid of the guild, G. haemon, which tended to be more common on stems level with the top of the plant canopy. 5. Large Asphondylia galls, especially those located near the top of the Borrichia canopy, were more likely to be discovered by searching parasitoids. Results using artificial galls were consistent with rates of parasitism of Asphondylia galls in native patches of sea oxeye daisy. Gall diameter was 19% greater and the rate of parasitism was reduced by almost 50% on short stems; as a result, gall abundance was 24% higher on short stems compared with ones located near the top of the plant canopy. 6. These results suggest that parasitoid community composition within galls is regulated by both interspecific differences in ovipositor length and preferences for specific gall size and/or stem length classes. © 2006 The Royal Entomological Society.",Asphondylia borrichiae | Borrichia frutescens | Community structure | Gall midges | Parasitoids,13,0,,undefined,,papers by authors,0,2006-12-01

Additionally, inhibition of noradrenergic transmission by brain-permeable beta-blockers could exacerbate cognitive impairment. This study examined effects of age and acute beta-blocker administration on LC and hippocampus pathology, neuroinflammation and learning and memory behavior in mice. Male mice, 3 and 18 months old, were administered propranolol (beta-blocker) or mabuterol (beta-adrenergic agonist) acutely around behavioral assessment. Terminal inflammatory markers in plasma, hippocampus and LC were assessed alongside histopathology. An increase in hippocampal and LC microgliosis and inflammatory proteins in the hippocampus was detected in aged mice. We report pathological hyperphosphorylation of the postsynaptic NMDA receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) in the hippocampus, suggesting neuronal hyperexcitability. Furthermore, the aged proteome revealed an induction in proteins related to energy metabolism, and mitochondria dysfunction in the LC and hippocampus. In a series of hippocampal dependent behavioral assessment tasks acute beta-adrenergic agonist or beta blocker administration altered learning and memory behavior in both aged and young mice. In Y-maze, propranolol and mabuterol differentially altered time spent in novel versus familiar arms in young and aged mice. Propranolol impaired Novel Object Recognition in both young and aged mice. Mabuterol enhanced trace learning in fear conditioning. Aged mice froze more to context and less to cue. Propranolol impaired contextual recall in aged mice.

However, mental stimulation may also have risks as well as benefits. As neurons release neurotransmitters, they often also release amyloid peptides and tau proteins into the extracellular space. These by-products of neural activity can aggregate into the tau tangle and amyloid plaque signatures of Alzheimer's disease. Over time, more active brain regions accumulate more pathology. Thus, increasing brain activity can have a cost. But the neuromodulator noradrenaline, released during novel and mentally stimulating events, may have some protective effects—as well as some negative effects. Via its inhibitory and excitatory effects on neurons and microglia, noradrenaline sometimes prevents and sometimes accelerates the production and accumulation of amyloid-β and tau in various brain regions. Both α2A- and β-adrenergic receptors influence amyloid-β production and tau hyperphosphorylation. Adrenergic activity also influences clearance of amyloid-β and tau. Furthermore, some findings suggest that Alzheimer's disease increases noradrenergic activity, at least in its early phases. Because older brains clear the by-products of synaptic activity less effectively, increased synaptic activity in the older brain risks accelerating the accumulation of Alzheimer's pathology more than it does in the younger brain.",Aging | Alzheimer's disease | Glutamatergic activity | Locus coeruleus,0,0,NIH,R01AG025340,National Institutes of Health,citing papers,2,2021-08-01

To test the above-mentioned theory, a study was conducted on a sample of 686 participants (395 controls, 156 mild cognitive impairment, 135 Alzheimer’s disease) investigating the relationship between LC volume, attentional performance and a biological index of brain maintenance (BrainPAD— an objective measure, which compares an individual’s structural brain health, reflected by their voxel-wise grey matter density, to the state typically expected at that individual’s age). Further analyses were carried out on reserve indices including education and occupational attainment. Volumetric variation across groups was also explored along with gender differences. Control analyses on the serotoninergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA) and cholinergic (Ach) systems were contrasted with the noradrenergic (NA) hypothesis. The antithetic relationships were also tested across the neuromodulatory subcortical systems. Results supported by Bayesian modelling showed that LC volume disproportionately predicted higher attentional performance as well as biological brain maintenance across the three groups. These findings lend support to the role of the noradrenergic system as a key mediator underpinning the neuropsychology of reserve, and they suggest that early prevention strategies focused on the noradrenergic system (e.g., cognitive-attentive training, physical exercise, pharmacological and dietary interventions) may yield important clinical benefits to mitigate cognitive impairment with age and disease.",Alzheimer’s disease | Brain age | Locus coeruleus | Mild cognitive impairment | Neuroimaging | Normal aging | Reserve | Visual attention | Voxel based morphometry,0,1,,undefined,,citing papers,1,2021-07-01

Amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology in the cortex in AD is thought to exacerbate the age-related loss of LC neurons, which may lead to cortical tau pathology. However, mechanisms underlying LC neurodegeneration remain elusive. Objective: Here, we aimed to examine how noradrenergic neurons are affected by cortical Aβ pathology in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F knock-in mice. Methods: The density of noradrenergic axons in LC-innervated regions and the LC neuron number were analyzed by an immunohistochemical method. To explore the potential mechanisms for LC degeneration, we also examined the occurrence of tau pathology in LC neurons, the association of reactive gliosis with LC neurons, and impaired trophic support in the brains of AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. Results: We observed a significant reduction in the density of noradrenergic axons from the LC in aged AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice without neuron loss or tau pathology, which was not limited to areas near Aβ plaques. However, none of the factors known to be related to the maintenance of LC neurons (i.e., somatostatin/somatostatin receptor 2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and neurotrophin-3) were significantly reduced in AppNL-G-F/NL-G-F mice. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that cortical Aβ pathology induces noradrenergic neurodegeneration, and further elucidation of the underlying mechanisms will reveal effective therapeutics to halt AD progression.",Alzheimer's disease | amyloid-β | locus coeruleus | neurotrophic factors | noradrenaline | somatostatin | tau,0,1,KAKEN,JP20H03571,Uehara Memorial Foundation,citing papers,11,2021-01-01

One important comorbidity is Down’s syndrome, which directly contributes to the severity and rapid progression of AD. The development of new therapeutic strategies for AD includes the repurposing of drugs currently used for the treatment of comorbidities.
